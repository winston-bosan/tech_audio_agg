This is obviously what I will now be doing. My enemies list is long, and yes, you&#8217;re on it, but unlike most ordinary opinion-barfers the State Department has the power to have me kidnapped from my home in the middle of the night and secreted away to a tropical island, where cold-eyed men in greasy wifebeaters will electrocute my nuts on a zinc table until I die. A good literary beef should always come with an element of danger: if you&#8217;re not fighting someone who has the <em>ability</em> to humiliate you, you probably need to set your sights a little higher. The State Department has left a trail of blood and gore over every inhabited continent. It&#8217;s probably the biggest game out there. Let&#8217;s go.</p><p>At the end of last month, the State Department posted a meandering little Substack essay titled <em><a href=\"https://statedept.substack.com/p/the-need-for-civilizational-allies-in-europe\">The Need for Civilisational Allies in Europe</a></em>. It writes:</p><p><em>The close relationship between the United States and Europe transcends geographic proximity and transactional politics. It represents a unique bond forged in common culture, faith, familial ties, mutual assistance in times of strife, and above all, a shared Western civilisational heritage.</em></p><p><em>Our transatlantic partnership is underpinned by a rich Western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty. This tradition flows from Athens and Rome, through medieval Christianity, to English common law, and ultimately into America's founding documents. The Declaration&#8217;s revolutionary assertion that men &#8216;are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&#8217; echoes the thought of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and other European heavyweights who recognised that all men possess natural rights that no government can arbitrate or deny. America remains indebted to Europe for this intellectual and cultural legacy.</em></p><p><em>In the aftermath of two devastating world wars, European nations sought to prevent future catastrophes by creating supranational structures that would bind nations closer together and allow for more substantial diplomatic and economic engagements.

To be honest, I don&#8217;t disagree that a lot of these European speech restrictions are bad and unhelpful, although I don&#8217;t see why the current US administration, with its policy of arresting and deporting people who write op-eds it doesn&#8217;t like, gets to be smug about this. What really interests me right now, though, are these four paragraphs. The writing is obviously awful; all government communiques might have the same bland, humourless, flatulent tone, but this is probably the first to describe Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as &#8216;heavyweights.&#8217; The ideas are similarly unimpressive, a wet glob of regurgitated Western Civ 101. But it&#8217;s very worrying if this is what the people who currently run the empire are thinking, because absolutely every claim made over the course of these four paragraphs is completely and utterly wrong.</p><p>America and Europe are not both part of something called &#8216;Western civilisation.&#8217; America is not a product of European traditions transplanted to the New World; in fact, it&#8217;s the other way round. More than 1,500 years ago, America created Europe. There really is something genuinely distinctive about Europe, but it has absolutely nothing to do with natural law, virtue ethics, national sovereignty, culture, or tradition, and a lot more to do with the supranational structures that the State Department accuses of undermining Europe&#8217;s own values. The world is much, much weirder than the State Department&#8212;whose work mostly consists of obliterating small bit of it&#8212;could ever imagine.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. The notion of &#8216;Western civilisation&#8217; is almost exclusively an American one; Europeans simply do not talk in these terms, unless we&#8217;re trying to cash in on the American culture wars. Like most bad ideas, it exists to make you ignore what&#8217;s right in front of your face, which is that the United States of America is not a European society, but an <em>American</em> one. </p><p>In its culture, institutions, and style of government, the US has no resemblance to France or Denmark, but it does look quite a lot like the Iroquois Confederation or the Aztec Triple Alliance. European countries are integral and territorial: each one is essentially a patch of farmland that could be conquered and defended by some warlord at some point between 476 and 1945, along with its population of bonded serfs. The basic unit of American sovereignty, meanwhile, is the <em>pact</em>, in which various disparate peoples invent institutions for globbing together in a theoretically limitless affiliative chain. The United States is also theoretically limitless: it bubbled away across the continent and then, once it hit the sea, started sweeping over Pacific islands like a tsunami. It may yet swallow up Canada too. This is entirely different to the process in which European territories are expanded or nibbled away at through conquest: the territory is simply wherever the pact is in force. </p><p>European society is literate and literary; America is fundamentally imagistic. A country of cave-painters. For the few Americans who <em>can</em> read, the written word is still magical in nature, a charm or amulet, a form of medicine, rather than an ordinary system for relaying meaning. (See, for instance, the basically savage invocation of Aristotle and Aquinas above.) For Europeans, freedom is imagined in social and sadistic terms; for Americans, both before and after Columbus, the notion of freedom is based in a metaphor of physically ranging unimpeded over large tracts of land.</p><p>The original founders of the United States understood this entirely, which is why the Sons of Liberty dressed as Native Americans when they threw the Dartmouth&#8217;s cargo into Boston Harbour. The 1778 Articles of Confederation may have been substantially inspired by the Gayanashagowa or Great Law of Peace that cemented the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, but unfortunately by 1787 the project was entirely in the hands of Roman Republic cosplayers like John Adams, with the result that most accounts of the origins of American liberalism now involve this tedious traipse from Athens to Rome to Runnymede to Plymouth Rock. There have always been a few visionaries, like Walt Whitman, who saw things clearly, but only recently have people really started pointing out the obvious. The strongest counter-history is the Graeber-Wengrow thesis, which observes that at the moment of contact between Europeans and Americans, the Europeans mostly lived under systems of extreme and explicit hierarchy and domination, while the Americans mostly lived in deliberative communities, governed by elected councils, in which any chieftain&#8217;s orders could be countermanded by someone asking &#8216;Why?&#8217; (Another feature is the democratisation of violence: in Europe, the state could impose hideous punishments, but in America a whole village might collectively torture you to death.) Our entire notion of freedom, they claim, originates here. </p><p>Graeber and Wengrow don&#8217;t argue that Americans are noble savages, <em>intrinsically</em> more free than Europeans; they locate the origin of liberalism in a specifically American political history centring on the collapse of the despotic, city-building, human-sacrificing state based in Cahokia, near present-day St Louis. This might be true, but it&#8217;s worth pointing out that where contemporary America is brutal and despotic, it&#8217;s brutal and despotic in a specifically <em>American</em> way. Most European societies (after Rome, obviously) never had a sizeable domestic population of slaves; American ones did. Power in American societies was often embodied in potlatches or nextlaoallis, spectacular squanderings of wealth or life. This is essentially how the American world-empire, which continually consumes the wealth of the entire planet, governs itself. </p><p>The liberal counterpart to the reactionary slog back to Aristotle is, of course, the idea that America is a settler-colonial state built on stolen land. This is not entirely untrue&#8212;there&#8217;s been significant population turnover&#8212;but it is unhelpful. The point should be to encourage settler-descendants to more completely integrate into American society. Three hundred million Elizabeth Warrens! The first step would be to replace English the language of government and commerce with one or more native languages. Navajo has the most speakers, but Mohawk would have an obvious symbolic resonance; alternately the heartland is already dotted with Algonquian place names. Education is important; all children should be inducted into their local tribe, made to go through painful initiation rituals, and so on. Most of them don&#8217;t require any blood quantum. Longhouse summer camps. Probably a majority of Americans already vaguely believe in the Great Spirit. It can be done.</p><p>Where does that leave Europe? The argument that Europe itself is a 1,500 year old American invention is a bit fiddlier, but it does holds together. It hinges on the Yeniseian languages, which are currently spoken by about a thousand people in three miserable villages along a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, deep in the middle of Russia. (The largest of those villages is called Kellog. As far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no connection to the cornflakes.) These are particularly interesting to linguists, because as far as we can tell the closest relatives of Yeniseian are not among other Siberian languages, but the Na-Den&#233; languages of north America. These include the Athabaskan group spoken across Alaska and Yukon, but also Tlingit on the Northwest Coast and Navajo and Apache in Arizona and New Mexico. For a while the assumption was that Yeniseian was another branch of the language spoken by one of the groups of Siberians to have crossed the Bering Strait and populated the Americas, but that seems not to be the case. In 2014, a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091722\">computational phylogenetic analysis</a> by Sicoli and Holton found that Yeniseian did not branch off before other languages in the family, but belongs to a clade <em>within </em>Na-Den&#233;. In other words, the Yeniseians were back-migrants: Americans who, thousands of years later, crossed the Bering Strait in the other direction and returned to Asia.</p><p>In the third century BC, a new people appeared on the borders of China. The Chinese were not unfamiliar with steppe peoples; they&#8217;d fought and traded with the Yuezhi, the Altaic and Iranian horse-nomads, for centuries. Confucian tradition assumed that the Yuezhi were basically made of the same stuff as ordinary people; one day, they would inevitably become civilised, obey the Son of Heaven, and adopt Chinese customs. This new people were different. They could not be cooked. The Chinese called them the Xiongnu, and Sima Qian writes that &#8216;they know nothing of ritual or righteousness&#8230; this is their Heaven-endowed nature.&#8217; Something like invaders from another planet: unutterably strange, and warlike in a way China had never experienced. It was Xiongnu raids that spurred the construction of the Great Wall. They lived under a form of government that had never been seen before anywhere in the Old World: the multiethnic tribal confederation. But there must have been one particular tribe at the heart of their pact, because there was a distinct Xiongnu language. Scholars are divided on exactly what this language was. Some assume it was Turkic, because there were a lot of Turkic tribes around at the time. Some conclude it was some kind of proto-Mongolian, because later Chinese wrote that the Mongols were the same as the Xiongnu. But a few linguists, like Edwin Pulleyblank and Alexander Vovin, have tried to study the few scraps of Xiongnu that are actually available, in rough Chinese transliteration. What they find is that Xiongnu bears a marked similarity to Yeniseian. </p><p>In 129 BC, the Xiongnu were finally broken against a massive mounted Han army. The survivors fled into the interior of Asia. Some of them stayed and became tributaries of Emperor Xuan. Others, the more warlike ones, started moving west. Their migration sent ripples through the world. Other steppe peoples either joined the confederation, or started fleeing ahead of their advance, attacking whatever weaker tribes lay to their west. The Xiongnu attacked the Turks, the Turks slammed into the Scythians, the Sycthians pressed into the Germans, and the Germans fled across the borders of a soft and over-ripe Roman Empire. Finally, the people who had <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-06-european-huns-ancient-siberian-roots.html\">once been known as the Xiongnu</a> arrived. In 440 AD, a native American brave named Attila the Hun crossed the Danube and made war against Rome. </p><p>This was the origin of Europe. In a Roman context, Europe is just a landmass. The world is divided into citizens and noncitizens; Roman citizens in Britain and Syria have far more in common with each other than they do with their Pictish or Arab relatives just across the border. A distinctive concept of Europe, a specifically European mode of social organisation, could only emerge out of the ruins of the Empire, once the Americans had torn it open. The distinctly European form of government that emerged in the Dark Ages is the one that most of Europe still lives under today. Europe is not about nations and peoples, knights and maidens, art and culture, knowledge and power, or freedom and democracy. Its history is the history of a <em>sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy</em>.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/what-is-europe\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

The United States is also theoretically limitless: it bubbled away across the continent and then, once it hit the sea, started sweeping over Pacific islands like a tsunami. It may yet swallow up Canada too. This is entirely different to the process in which European territories are expanded or nibbled away at through conquest: the territory is simply wherever the pact is in force.\nEuropean society is literate and literary; America is fundamentally imagistic. A country of cave-painters. For the few Americans who can read, the written word is still magical in nature, a charm or amulet, a form of medicine, rather than an ordinary system for relaying meaning. (See, for instance, the basically savage invocation of Aristotle and Aquinas above.) For Europeans, freedom is imagined in social and sadistic terms; for Americans, both before and after Columbus, the notion of freedom is based in a metaphor of physically ranging unimpeded over large tracts of land.\nThe original founders of the United States understood this entirely, which is why the Sons of Liberty dressed as Native Americans when they threw the Dartmouth’s cargo into Boston Harbour. The 1778 Articles of Confederation may have been substantially inspired by the Gayanashagowa or Great Law of Peace that cemented the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, but unfortunately by 1787 the project was entirely in the hands of Roman Republic cosplayers like John Adams, with the result that most accounts of the origins of American liberalism now involve this tedious traipse from Athens to Rome to Runnymede to Plymouth Rock. There have always been a few visionaries, like Walt Whitman, who saw things clearly, but only recently have people really started pointing out the obvious. The strongest counter-history is the Graeber-Wengrow thesis, which observes that at the moment of contact between Europeans and Americans, the Europeans mostly lived under systems of extreme and explicit hierarchy and domination, while the Americans mostly lived in deliberative communities, governed by elected councils, in which any chieftain’s orders could be countermanded by someone asking ‘Why?’ (Another feature is the democratisation of violence: in Europe, the state could impose hideous punishments, but in America a whole village might collectively torture you to death.) Our entire notion of freedom, they claim, originates here.\nGraeber and Wengrow don’t argue that Americans are noble savages, intrinsically more free than Europeans; they locate the origin of liberalism in a specifically American political history centring on the collapse of the despotic, city-building, human-sacrificing state based in Cahokia, near present-day St Louis. This might be true, but it’s worth pointing out that where contemporary America is brutal and despotic, it’s brutal and despotic in a specifically American way. Most European societies (after Rome, obviously) never had a sizeable domestic population of slaves; American ones did. Power in American societies was often embodied in potlatches or nextlaoallis, spectacular squanderings of wealth or life. This is essentially how the American world-empire, which continually consumes the wealth of the entire planet, governs itself.\nThe liberal counterpart to the reactionary slog back to Aristotle is, of course, the idea that America is a settler-colonial state built on stolen land. This is not entirely untrue—there’s been significant population turnover—but it is unhelpful. The point should be to encourage settler-descendants to more completely integrate into American society. Three hundred million Elizabeth Warrens! The first step would be to replace English the language of government and commerce with one or more native languages. Navajo has the most speakers, but Mohawk would have an obvious symbolic resonance; alternately the heartland is already dotted with Algonquian place names. Education is important; all children should be inducted into their local tribe, made to go through painful initiation rituals, and so on. Most of them don’t require any blood quantum. Longhouse summer camps. Probably a majority of Americans already vaguely believe in the Great Spirit. It can be done.\nWhere does that leave Europe? The argument that Europe itself is a 1,500 year old American invention is a bit fiddlier, but it does holds together. It hinges on the Yeniseian languages, which are currently spoken by about a thousand people in three miserable villages along a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, deep in the middle of Russia. (The largest of those villages is called Kellog. As far as I can tell, there’s no connection to the cornflakes.) These are particularly interesting to linguists, because as far as we can tell the closest relatives of Yeniseian are not among other Siberian languages, but the Na-Dené languages of north America. These include the Athabaskan group spoken across Alaska and Yukon, but also Tlingit on the Northwest Coast and Navajo and Apache in Arizona and New Mexico. For a while the assumption was that Yeniseian was another branch of the language spoken by one of the groups of Siberians to have crossed the Bering Strait and populated the Americas, but that seems not to be the case. In 2014, a computational phylogenetic analysis by Sicoli and Holton found that Yeniseian did not branch off before other languages in the family, but belongs to a clade within Na-Dené. In other words, the Yeniseians were back-migrants: Americans who, thousands of years later, crossed the Bering Strait in the other direction and returned to Asia.\nIn the third century BC, a new people appeared on the borders of China. The Chinese were not unfamiliar with steppe peoples; they’d fought and traded with the Yuezhi, the Altaic and Iranian horse-nomads, for centuries. Confucian tradition assumed that the Yuezhi were basically made of the same stuff as ordinary people; one day, they would inevitably become civilised, obey the Son of Heaven, and adopt Chinese customs. This new people were different. They could not be cooked. The Chinese called them the Xiongnu, and Sima Qian writes that ‘they know nothing of ritual or righteousness… this is their Heaven-endowed nature.’ Something like invaders from another planet: unutterably strange, and warlike in a way China had never experienced. It was Xiongnu raids that spurred the construction of the Great Wall. They lived under a form of government that had never been seen before anywhere in the Old World: the multiethnic tribal confederation. But there must have been one particular tribe at the heart of their pact, because there was a distinct Xiongnu language. Scholars are divided on exactly what this language was. Some assume it was Turkic, because there were a lot of Turkic tribes around at the time. Some conclude it was some kind of proto-Mongolian, because later Chinese wrote that the Mongols were the same as the Xiongnu. But a few linguists, like Edwin Pulleyblank and Alexander Vovin, have tried to study the few scraps of Xiongnu that are actually available, in rough Chinese transliteration. What they find is that Xiongnu bears a marked similarity to Yeniseian.\nIn 129 BC, the Xiongnu were finally broken against a massive mounted Han army. The survivors fled into the interior of Asia. Some of them stayed and became tributaries of Emperor Xuan. Others, the more warlike ones, started moving west. Their migration sent ripples through the world. Other steppe peoples either joined the confederation, or started fleeing ahead of their advance, attacking whatever weaker tribes lay to their west. The Xiongnu attacked the Turks, the Turks slammed into the Scythians, the Sycthians pressed into the Germans, and the Germans fled across the borders of a soft and over-ripe Roman Empire. Finally, the people who had once been known as the Xiongnu arrived. In 440 AD, a native American brave named Attila the Hun crossed the Danube and made war against Rome.\nThis was the origin of Europe. In a Roman context, Europe is just a landmass. The world is divided into citizens and noncitizens; Roman citizens in Britain and Syria have far more in common with each other than they do with their Pictish or Arab relatives just across the border. A distinctive concept of Europe, a specifically European mode of social organisation, could only emerge out of the ruins of the Empire, once the Americans had torn it open. The distinctly European form of government that emerged in the Dark Ages is the one that most of Europe still lives under today. Europe is not about nations and peoples, knights and maidens, art and culture, knowledge and power, or freedom and democracy. Its history is the history of a sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy.\nRead more",

The nefarious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO has attacked the famous GOLDSCHMITT MANOR, fabulous home of MAYA GOLDSCHMITT, the city&#8217;s LEATHERIEST HEIRESS! The villain&#8217;s attack comes during a SWANKY SOIR&#201;E for investors in METZITZAH SYSTEMS, the high-tech Israeli arms manufacturer responsible for the BABYMASHER 3000, a loitering munition used to DEVASTATING EFFECT in maternity wards across the Gaza Strip! PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO, an adjunct in COMPARATIVE LITERATURE at the local university, has barricaded himself into the OPULENT BALLROOM at GOLDSCHMITT MANOR with five hostages! These are MAYA GOLDSCHMITT herself, billionaire playboy BRICK KOPF, local philanthropist RONNY LUFTMENSCH, beloved TV personality SUSAN PLAPEL, and OMER BALOG, the brilliant bald-headed boffin CTO of METZITZAH SYSTEMS! The devious PROFESSOR has wired his hostages with EXPLOSIVES&#8212;simply for the crime of BEING JEWISH! The bombs are attached to a DEAD MAN&#8217;S SWITCH, meaning that if the POLICE SNIPERS arranged around GOLDSCHMITT MANOR take a shot, all of SOPHISTICO&#8217;s hostages will POP LIKE WET CONFETTI! With no other recourse, the authorities have sent in the bumbling JIM PLAYNE, amateur hostage negotiator, to try to talk the CRAZED PROFESSOR down! Will PLAYNE manage to make a cogent case against INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE as a LEGITIMATE FORM OF RESISTANCE? Or will he himself end up being seduced by the MAD PROFESSOR&#8217;S DEMENTED IDEOLOGY? Read on to find out&#8230;</em></p><div><hr></div><p>PLAYNE: Nice barricades you&#8217;ve got here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Thanks.</p><p>PLAYNE: You&#8217;ve put all these bits of wood together very precisely. It looks great. If I were Maya Goldschmitt I&#8217;d keep them up afterwards.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I watch Japanese woodworking on TikTok. It&#8217;s relaxing.</p><p>PLAYNE: Yeah?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: It&#8217;s called sashimono. They do joinery without any nails or glue. It all rests on these highly complex joints carved using simple chisels called nomi. I can show you some videos if you like.</p><p>PLAYNE: That&#8217;d be&#8212;maybe afterwards? You&#8217;ve also&#8212;it looks like you&#8217;ve taken a couple of hostages here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I&#8217;m striking back against the machinery of death.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Indistinct panicked mumbling through their gags</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: And how are we feeling about this? Any, you know, regrets?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Pretty good, to be honest. </p><p>PLAYNE: Alright. Mind walking me through how we got here?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Well, basically how it started was that I couldn&#8217;t sleep. Every day, I watch videos of what&#8217;s happening in Gaza. The most horrible, horrible stuff. The other day I saw a father holding up half of his daughter. Half of a little girl. An Israeli bomb had exploded inside their house and it just cut her body in half. She&#8217;d never hurt anyone. Or there&#8217;s videos of babies, crying babies with exposed ribcages. They don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t have any food. Every day it&#8217;s like this. There&#8217;s been an airstrike on a school. There&#8217;s been a team of medics shot one by one and buried in a mass grave. They&#8217;ve gunned down dozens of hungry people trying to get food. They targeted the home of a paediatrician and killed nine of her children. Kids she loved and cared for all their lives, and Israel wiped them all out in an instant. For no reason. So I see all of this happening, and then I can&#8217;t sleep. I keep lying in bed, thinking about it, until it&#8217;s five, six in the morning. How am I supposed to sleep in my warm bed, in my safe home, while <em>this</em> is happening to my fellow human beings? How can anyone just go about their normal lives when we&#8217;re watching a live-streamed genocide, twenty-four hours a day? I think the reason I couldn&#8217;t sleep was my conscience. It was telling me I had a duty to do something. So this is me doing something.</p><p>PLAYNE: You watch snuff films before bed and then you can&#8217;t sleep.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Yeah. Do you think I should just <em>ignore</em> it? Pretend it isn&#8217;t happening? Wall myself off?</p><p>PLAYNE: No, no. Just saying. Let&#8217;s go back. You said you had a duty to do something. But there&#8217;s lots of ways of doing something. You could have, you know, marched&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Ha. Of course they&#8217;d send a lib. Look, imagine this. Imagine it isn&#8217;t Gaza. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m right here, going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun&#8212;</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, you <em>are</em> right here, going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Let me finish. Imagine I go into your house at night and [<em>making gun fingers</em>] bang, I murder your wife. Bang, murder your son. While they&#8217;re sleeping. Then I take out a saw and <em>cut your daughter in half</em>. Next night, I do it again, to your neighbour. And the next night, and the night after that, for nearly two years, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop me. In fact, they&#8217;re supplying me with ammunition. And then in the daytime, they let me go on the TV and explain that I had to do it because those kids made me feel unsafe, and by the way I&#8217;m the most moral man in town, and if you have any problem with me breaking into houses and wiping out families, you&#8217;re some kind of <em>bigot</em>. I keep getting away with it, and I keep killing. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you&#8217;d sleep well at night? Would you choose non-violence? Would you go on a protest march against me? Write a letter to the Mayor? Fight against hatred with the power of love? Or would you do whatever it took to stop me before I killed again? </p><p>PLAYNE: I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the same.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: No. Because in my thought experiment it&#8217;s happening <em>here</em>, and in reality it&#8217;s happening somewhere else. A lot of people just don&#8217;t view Palestinians as fully human. When <em>their</em> children are cut in half it doesn&#8217;t matter. But I refuse to care less about someone&#8217;s life just because they live far away.</p><p>PLAYNE: I guess what I meant is that, like I said, you really are going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun. You say you&#8217;re so horrified by violence, but here you are, committing acts of violence.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: OK, now we&#8217;re getting into it. You&#8217;re against violence? All violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Yes. I think so.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But right now there&#8217;s snipers pointing guns at me through the window. I don&#8217;t think you <em>want</em> them to take me out, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d prefer it if everyone could leave this room alive. But if they shot me in the middle of an active hostage situation, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be morally outraged. So there&#8217;s clearly some violence you&#8217;re willing to accept and some violence you&#8217;re not. </p><p>PLAYNE: That&#8217;s true.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: So what&#8217;s the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, the police, they&#8217;ve got legal authority&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Exactly. Their violence is <em>legitimate</em>. It comes from the state. The state can send people to prison, but when I keep people in a room against their will it&#8217;s hostage-taking. If the state thinks parents are doing a bad job, it can kidnap their children; I can&#8217;t. And Israel is a state, an internationally recognised sovereign power, which is why it&#8217;s allowed to cut little girls in half, and private citizens are not. But there is such a thing in international law as the <em>right to resist</em>. Did you know that? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that we &#8216;have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.&#8217; So illegitimate individual violence is actually <em>legitimate</em> under the law. The distinction contradicts itself. So what else? How else do you tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: I don&#8217;t know.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Muffled sounds of alarm getting louder</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: But look, the police wouldn&#8217;t be here if you hadn&#8217;t walked into a party full of people and started pointing guns at them. We&#8217;re trying to put an <em>end</em> to violence. That&#8217;s just not the same as deliberately starting it. </p><p>SOPHISTICO: Sure.</p><p>PLAYNE: So why don&#8217;t we try, maybe, letting one of the hostages&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But I didn&#8217;t initiate the violence here. Every single one of these people is an investor in Metzitzah Systems. They are all <em>making money</em> out of a campaign of mass slaughter being waged on the other side of the world. I&#8217;m just responding. The violence is already taking place, and I&#8217;m the one trying to end it. Similarly, the violence on October 7th was a response to decades of illegal blockade, occupation, and colonisation against the people of Palestine. The distinction between initiating violence and responding with violence also doesn&#8217;t hold. There&#8217;s always a precedent. </p><p>PLAYNE: So why don&#8217;t you support the war then?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: What do you mean?</p><p>PLAYNE: You say this violence is justified by a previous act of violence. So doesn&#8217;t that apply to Israeli violence as well? How do <em>you</em> tell the difference between good and bad violence?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I was getting there.</p><p>PLAYNE: Go on, then.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Acceptable violence is the violence that liberates the oppressed from their oppression. Liberals like you only accept violence when it&#8217;s &#8216;legitimate,&#8217; in other words, when it&#8217;s used by the established order to crush and pacify the powerless. I&#8217;m the opposite. </p><p>PLAYNE: Right.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Good, isn&#8217;t it?</p><p>PLAYNE: I&#8217;m thinking about it. I worry it might have some holes.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Like what?</p><p>PLAYNE: I mean, do you really think that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing? Liberating the oppressed from their oppression?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I&#8217;m trying.</p><p>PLAYNE: I don&#8217;t know if I buy it. If you were really serious about liberating the oppressed, you wouldn&#8217;t be taking hostages and hooking them up to explosives. Let&#8217;s say our conversation here ends badly, and you blow up all these people here&#8212;</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Squirming in panic</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: &#8212;what do you think happens next? Let me tell you. Everyone you hate&#8212;<em>they</em> get to be the victim now. You&#8217;ve just given them a big gory piece of evidence that <em>they&#8217;re</em> the oppressed, not you, which means <em>their</em> violence is justified, not yours. These categories are more malleable than you think. And a lot of people will start agreeing with them, because most people don&#8217;t want to be on the same side as a crazy killer. So everyone who&#8217;s been trying to do the serious work of advocating for Palestine now has to deal with the PR nightmare another violent extremist in their ranks. There are reams of evidence that this kind of violent action is almost always counterproductive. Plus, just like you said, every violent act provokes a violent response. How do you think the Israelis will respond to this? Will they bomb Gaza <em>less</em>? Do you really think this will put a <em>stop</em> to the cycle of violence? It seems to me that all you&#8217;ve done is snuffed out five human lives forever, and made things <em>worse</em> for the people you claim to care about in the process. And yourself, of course.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nTERROR in the heart of the city! The nefarious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO has attacked the famous GOLDSCHMITT MANOR, fabulous home of MAYA GOLDSCHMITT, the city’s LEATHERIEST HEIRESS! The villain’s attack comes during a SWANKY SOIRÉE for investors in METZITZAH SYSTEMS, the high-tech Israeli arms manufacturer responsible for the BABYMASHER 3000, a loitering munition used to DEVASTATING EFFECT in maternity wards across the Gaza Strip! PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO, an adjunct in COMPARATIVE LITERATURE at the local university, has barricaded himself into the OPULENT BALLROOM at GOLDSCHMITT MANOR with five hostages! These are MAYA GOLDSCHMITT herself, billionaire playboy BRICK KOPF, local philanthropist RONNY LUFTMENSCH, beloved TV personality SUSAN PLAPEL, and OMER BALOG, the brilliant bald-headed boffin CTO of METZITZAH SYSTEMS! The devious PROFESSOR has wired his hostages with EXPLOSIVES—simply for the crime of BEING JEWISH! The bombs are attached to a DEAD MAN’S SWITCH, meaning that if the POLICE SNIPERS arranged around GOLDSCHMITT MANOR take a shot, all of SOPHISTICO’s hostages will POP LIKE WET CONFETTI! With no other recourse, the authorities have sent in the bumbling JIM PLAYNE, amateur hostage negotiator, to try to talk the CRAZED PROFESSOR down! Will PLAYNE manage to make a cogent case against INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE as a LEGITIMATE FORM OF RESISTANCE? Or will he himself end up being seduced by the MAD PROFESSOR’S DEMENTED IDEOLOGY? Read on to find out…\n\nPLAYNE: Nice barricades you’ve got here.\nSOPHISTICO: Thanks.\nPLAYNE: You’ve put all these bits of wood together very precisely. It looks great. If I were Maya Goldschmitt I’d keep them up afterwards.\nSOPHISTICO: I watch Japanese woodworking on TikTok. It’s relaxing.\nPLAYNE: Yeah?\nSOPHISTICO: It’s called sashimono. They do joinery without any nails or glue. It all rests on these highly complex joints carved using simple chisels called nomi. I can show you some videos if you like.\nPLAYNE: That’d be—maybe afterwards? You’ve also—it looks like you’ve taken a couple of hostages here.\nSOPHISTICO: I’m striking back against the machinery of death.\nHOSTAGES: [ Indistinct panicked mumbling through their gags]\nPLAYNE: And how are we feeling about this? Any, you know, regrets?\nSOPHISTICO: Pretty good, to be honest.\nPLAYNE: Alright. Mind walking me through how we got here?\nSOPHISTICO: Well, basically how it started was that I couldn’t sleep. Every day, I watch videos of what’s happening in Gaza. The most horrible, horrible stuff. The other day I saw a father holding up half of his daughter. Half of a little girl. An Israeli bomb had exploded inside their house and it just cut her body in half. She’d never hurt anyone. Or there’s videos of babies, crying babies with exposed ribcages. They don’t understand why they can’t have any food. Every day it’s like this. There’s been an airstrike on a school. There’s been a team of medics shot one by one and buried in a mass grave. They’ve gunned down dozens of hungry people trying to get food. They targeted the home of a paediatrician and killed nine of her children. Kids she loved and cared for all their lives, and Israel wiped them all out in an instant. For no reason. So I see all of this happening, and then I can’t sleep. I keep lying in bed, thinking about it, until it’s five, six in the morning. How am I supposed to sleep in my warm bed, in my safe home, while this is happening to my fellow human beings? How can anyone just go about their normal lives when we’re watching a live-streamed genocide, twenty-four hours a day? I think the reason I couldn’t sleep was my conscience. It was telling me I had a duty to do something. So this is me doing something.\nPLAYNE: You watch snuff films before bed and then you can’t sleep.\nSOPHISTICO: Yeah. Do you think I should just ignore it? Pretend it isn’t happening? Wall myself off?\nPLAYNE: No, no. Just saying. Let’s go back. You said you had a duty to do something. But there’s lots of ways of doing something. You could have, you know, marched—\nSOPHISTICO: Ha. Of course they’d send a lib. Look, imagine this. Imagine it isn’t Gaza. Let’s say I’m right here, going into people’s houses with a gun—\nPLAYNE: Well, you are right here, going into people’s houses with a gun.\nSOPHISTICO: Let me finish. Imagine I go into your house at night and [ making gun fingers] bang, I murder your wife. Bang, murder your son. While they’re sleeping. Then I take out a saw and cut your daughter in half. Next night, I do it again, to your neighbour. And the next night, and the night after that, for nearly two years, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop me. In fact, they’re supplying me with ammunition. And then in the daytime, they let me go on the TV and explain that I had to do it because those kids made me feel unsafe, and by the way I’m the most moral man in town, and if you have any problem with me breaking into houses and wiping out families, you’re some kind of bigot. I keep getting away with it, and I keep killing. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you’d sleep well at night? Would you choose non-violence? Would you go on a protest march against me? Write a letter to the Mayor? Fight against hatred with the power of love? Or would you do whatever it took to stop me before I killed again?\nPLAYNE: I’m not sure it’s the same.\nSOPHISTICO: No. Because in my thought experiment it’s happening here, and in reality it’s happening somewhere else. A lot of people just don’t view Palestinians as fully human. When their children are cut in half it doesn’t matter. But I refuse to care less about someone’s life just because they live far away.\nPLAYNE: I guess what I meant is that, like I said, you really are going into people’s houses with a gun. You say you’re so horrified by violence, but here you are, committing acts of violence.\nSOPHISTICO: OK, now we’re getting into it. You’re against violence? All violence?\nPLAYNE: Yes. I think so.\nSOPHISTICO: But right now there’s snipers pointing guns at me through the window. I don’t think you want them to take me out, I’m sure you’d prefer it if everyone could leave this room alive. But if they shot me in the middle of an active hostage situation, I don’t think you’d be morally outraged. So there’s clearly some violence you’re willing to accept and some violence you’re not.\nPLAYNE: That’s true.\nSOPHISTICO: So what’s the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?\nPLAYNE: Well, the police, they’ve got legal authority—\nSOPHISTICO: Exactly. Their violence is legitimate. It comes from the state. The state can send people to prison, but when I keep people in a room against their will it’s hostage-taking. If the state thinks parents are doing a bad job, it can kidnap their children; I can’t. And Israel is a state, an internationally recognised sovereign power, which is why it’s allowed to cut little girls in half, and private citizens are not. But there is such a thing in international law as the right to resist. Did you know that? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that we ‘have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.’ So illegitimate individual violence is actually legitimate under the law. The distinction contradicts itself. So what else? How else do you tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?\nPLAYNE: I don’t know.\nHOSTAGES: [ Muffled sounds of alarm getting louder]\nPLAYNE: But look, the police wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t walked into a party full of people and started pointing guns at them. We’re trying to put an end to violence. That’s just not the same as deliberately starting it.\nSOPHISTICO: Sure.\nPLAYNE: So why don’t we try, maybe, letting one of the hostages—\nSOPHISTICO: But I didn’t initiate the violence here. Every single one of these people is an investor in Metzitzah Systems. They are all making money out of a campaign of mass slaughter being waged on the other side of the world. I’m just responding. The violence is already taking place, and I’m the one trying to end it. Similarly, the violence on October 7th was a response to decades of illegal blockade, occupation, and colonisation against the people of Palestine. The distinction between initiating violence and responding with violence also doesn’t hold. There’s always a precedent.\nPLAYNE: So why don’t you support the war then?\nSOPHISTICO: What do you mean?\nPLAYNE: You say this violence is justified by a previous act of violence. So doesn’t that apply to Israeli violence as well? How do you tell the difference between good and bad violence?\nSOPHISTICO: I was getting there.\nPLAYNE: Go on, then.\nSOPHISTICO: Acceptable violence is the violence that liberates the oppressed from their oppression. Liberals like you only accept violence when it’s ‘legitimate,’ in other words, when it’s used by the established order to crush and pacify the powerless. I’m the opposite.\nPLAYNE: Right.\nSOPHISTICO: Good, isn’t it?\nPLAYNE: I’m thinking about it. I worry it might have some holes.\nSOPHISTICO: Like what?\nPLAYNE: I mean, do you really think that’s what you’re doing? Liberating the oppressed from their oppression?\nSOPHISTICO: I’m trying.\nPLAYNE: I don’t know if I buy it. If you were really serious about liberating the oppressed, you wouldn’t be taking hostages and hooking them up to explosives. Let’s say our conversation here ends badly, and you blow up all these people here—\nHOSTAGES: [ Squirming in panic]\nPLAYNE: —what do you think happens next? Let me tell you. Everyone you hate— they get to be the victim now. You’ve just given them a big gory piece of evidence that they’re the oppressed, not you, which means their violence is justified, not yours. These categories are more malleable than you think. And a lot of people will start agreeing with them, because most people don’t want to be on the same side as a crazy killer. So everyone who’s been trying to do the serious work of advocating for Palestine now has to deal with the PR nightmare another violent extremist in their ranks. There are reams of evidence that this kind of violent action is almost always counterproductive. Plus, just like you said, every violent act provokes a violent response. How do you think the Israelis will respond to this? Will they bomb Gaza less? Do you really think this will put a stop to the cycle of violence? It seems to me that all you’ve done is snuffed out five human lives forever, and made things worse for the people you claim to care about in the process. And yourself, of course. You’re Merry Levov, blowing up a post office. Pointless waste.\nSOPHISTICO: I see. So now you don’t think violence is bad. It’s just ineffective.\nPLAYNE: Look, man, I’m a hostage negotiator. I’m just trying to get you to let these people go. If I can sell you on violence being bad, I’ll say that. If I can sell you on violence being ineffective, that works too. If I thought I could convince you that the established order isn’t so awful, I’d give it a shot.\nSOPHISTICO: It’s difficult to have an honest discussion with someone who doesn’t really believe in anything.\nPLAYNE: Does it matter what I believe? I just accept whatever’s been convincingly demonstrated to me. You should try it. You know I’m right.\nSOPHISTICO: No. You’re not. Imagine this. It’s World War Two and your country is occupied by the Nazis. They’re carting away all the Jews and Roma to concentration camps. You watch it happen every day. Now, if you want, you can run away into the hills and join up with the partisans. Fight the Nazis. But the Nazis have a reprisals policy.

It&#8217;s gone. Whatever still exists is just a remnant, barely hanging on in its own country, and in a few decades it&#8217;ll probably be snuffed out for good. The English way of existing in the world is steadily being eroded by foreign customs. Already, the country I grew up in is unrecognisable, full of strange and angry people spouting misshapen foreign ideas. Foreign ideas about the need for a <em>shared</em> <em>community</em>. About how society isn&#8217;t just a collection of individuals, but a group with a <em>common purpose</em>, growing out of the traditional structures of kith and kin. About a people deeply rooted in a particular place, and about the placeless migrants like locusts on the wind, tearing it all apart. This stuff isn&#8217;t just on the fringes any more: this month, even the Prime Minister started talking about how uncontrolled immigration means &#8216;we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.&#8217; What hope is there for England when even its leaders are spouting this dreck?</p><p>You have never been deeply rooted in any particular place, and you have always been an island of strangers. The current level of migration might not be to everyone&#8217;s benefit, or even really <em>anyone&#8217;s</em> benefit (more on that later), but it can&#8217;t destroy what doesn&#8217;t exist. There <em>used</em> to be a people who were deeply rooted in this place, a millennium and a half ago, but not any more. They went with the giants. </p><p>When the first refugees came here after the sack of Troy, they found the place wild and empty, but not silent: at night, in the hills and the forests, they trembled at the inarticulate groans of giants. The people built cities, and the giants came howling out of the hills to smash down the walls. Geoffey of Monmouth says the last of the giants were killed by Brutus and Corineus in Cernyw, but later at least one giant, Br&#226;n Fendigaidd son of Ll&#375;r, became king of the Britons. They must have made some kind of peace; after that it was the blood of the giants that ruled. Br&#226;n was so huge that no house could contain him. After his sister Branwen was mistreated by Matholwch king of Ireland, Br&#226;n Fendigaidd sent an army from all the one hundred and fifty-four districts of Britain to sail over and rescue her, but because he was too big to fit in a ship he had to wade across the Irish Sea. When the swineherds of Ireland saw him in the distance, they mistook him for a mountain rising out of the water, and his two furious eyes for two gleaming lakes. By the end Br&#226;n had laid waste to so much of Ireland that the only survivors were five pregnant women hiding in a cave, but in the fighting his foot was pierced by a poisoned spear. He told his followers to cut off his head and bury it at the Gwynfryn in Caer Lud, facing south. As long as his head was in that spot, no oppression would ever come from across the sea to the Island of Britain. The noble triads in the Red Book of Hergest record that the burying of Br&#226;n&#8217;s head was the first of the Three Fortunate Concealments; the third of the Three Unfortunate Unconcealments was when Arthur decided to dig it up again. It hurt his pride to imagine that the land would need any protection other than himself, so he disinterred the head, and then he defended these shores until he died. And then, oozing against the beaches of this island like an algae bloom, the Saxons came. </p><p>It might not be nice to point this out, it might not be politically correct, but the Saxons really don&#8217;t belong here. Even after all this time, fifteen hundred years of this great bunch of lads tactically chundering all over Arthur&#8217;s kingdom, they&#8217;re still uncomfortable in the land. Like their thing with the weather. The Saxons will not stop complaining about the weather. The springs are too grey. The summers are too mild. It&#8217;s literally all they talk about, how endlessly disappointed they are by this country&#8217;s weather, and how desperate they are to briefly fly off somewhere else. Well, not to be rude, but if you hate it so much, then what the fuck are you doing here? If you wanted a long, hot, dry summer, and a fairytale winter where it always snows on Christmas, you should have stayed in the marshes of the Elbe where you came from. Why would you come to an island with such a witchy, mystic climate, silver curtains of rain, fog, weather that changes unpredictably several times a day&#8212;and then jump on the first RyanAir to Marbella? Why didn&#8217;t you join up with the Visigoths instead? You had a choice.</p><p>But this island was always just a brief staging-post for the Saxons: a few hundred years here to gather supplies, work on new types of rigging, and then off again to spread their sickness across the world. This is why the salmon-hunting grounds of the Tlingit and Salish, where animal ancestors grinned from wooden poles in the mist, are now part of something called British Columbia. Why you can fly to Te Ika-a-Maui, an island lost in endless ocean, on a wild and distant hemisphere, where all the old stories are about canoes, taro, salt-spray, gods woven from coconut fibre, and find it full of awkward people with wonky smiles dunking biscuits in milky tea. </p><p>Are they comfortable there? Of course not. The Saxons aren&#8217;t comfortable anywhere. There&#8217;s never been a people that squirms so awkwardly inside their own skin. Talking about sex famously throws them into crisis, but so does talking about <em>anything</em>. They sit on trains, silent. On the bus, silent.

For most young people in England, the period before marriage wasn&#8217;t spent with the kinship group, but in service: wage-labour. Poll tax records from 1377 show that over 13% of rural households in England included unrelated servants; in contemporary France the number was closer to 2%, almost all of them aristocratic estates.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nEngland is over. It’s gone. Whatever still exists is just a remnant, barely hanging on in its own country, and in a few decades it’ll probably be snuffed out for good. The English way of existing in the world is steadily being eroded by foreign customs. Already, the country I grew up in is unrecognisable, full of strange and angry people spouting misshapen foreign ideas. Foreign ideas about the need for a shared community. About how society isn’t just a collection of individuals, but a group with a common purpose, growing out of the traditional structures of kith and kin. About a people deeply rooted in a particular place, and about the placeless migrants like locusts on the wind, tearing it all apart. This stuff isn’t just on the fringes any more: this month, even the Prime Minister started talking about how uncontrolled immigration means ‘we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.’ What hope is there for England when even its leaders are spouting this dreck?\nYou have never been deeply rooted in any particular place, and you have always been an island of strangers. The current level of migration might not be to everyone’s benefit, or even really anyone’s benefit (more on that later), but it can’t destroy what doesn’t exist. There used to be a people who were deeply rooted in this place, a millennium and a half ago, but not any more. They went with the giants.\nWhen the first refugees came here after the sack of Troy, they found the place wild and empty, but not silent: at night, in the hills and the forests, they trembled at the inarticulate groans of giants. The people built cities, and the giants came howling out of the hills to smash down the walls. Geoffey of Monmouth says the last of the giants were killed by Brutus and Corineus in Cernyw, but later at least one giant, Brân Fendigaidd son of Llŷr, became king of the Britons. They must have made some kind of peace; after that it was the blood of the giants that ruled. Brân was so huge that no house could contain him. After his sister Branwen was mistreated by Matholwch king of Ireland, Brân Fendigaidd sent an army from all the one hundred and fifty-four districts of Britain to sail over and rescue her, but because he was too big to fit in a ship he had to wade across the Irish Sea. When the swineherds of Ireland saw him in the distance, they mistook him for a mountain rising out of the water, and his two furious eyes for two gleaming lakes. By the end Brân had laid waste to so much of Ireland that the only survivors were five pregnant women hiding in a cave, but in the fighting his foot was pierced by a poisoned spear. He told his followers to cut off his head and bury it at the Gwynfryn in Caer Lud, facing south. As long as his head was in that spot, no oppression would ever come from across the sea to the Island of Britain. The noble triads in the Red Book of Hergest record that the burying of Brân’s head was the first of the Three Fortunate Concealments; the third of the Three Unfortunate Unconcealments was when Arthur decided to dig it up again. It hurt his pride to imagine that the land would need any protection other than himself, so he disinterred the head, and then he defended these shores until he died. And then, oozing against the beaches of this island like an algae bloom, the Saxons came.\nIt might not be nice to point this out, it might not be politically correct, but the Saxons really don’t belong here. Even after all this time, fifteen hundred years of this great bunch of lads tactically chundering all over Arthur’s kingdom, they’re still uncomfortable in the land. Like their thing with the weather. The Saxons will not stop complaining about the weather. The springs are too grey. The summers are too mild. It’s literally all they talk about, how endlessly disappointed they are by this country’s weather, and how desperate they are to briefly fly off somewhere else. Well, not to be rude, but if you hate it so much, then what the fuck are you doing here? If you wanted a long, hot, dry summer, and a fairytale winter where it always snows on Christmas, you should have stayed in the marshes of the Elbe where you came from. Why would you come to an island with such a witchy, mystic climate, silver curtains of rain, fog, weather that changes unpredictably several times a day—and then jump on the first RyanAir to Marbella? Why didn’t you join up with the Visigoths instead? You had a choice.\nBut this island was always just a brief staging-post for the Saxons: a few hundred years here to gather supplies, work on new types of rigging, and then off again to spread their sickness across the world. This is why the salmon-hunting grounds of the Tlingit and Salish, where animal ancestors grinned from wooden poles in the mist, are now part of something called British Columbia. Why you can fly to Te Ika-a-Maui, an island lost in endless ocean, on a wild and distant hemisphere, where all the old stories are about canoes, taro, salt-spray, gods woven from coconut fibre, and find it full of awkward people with wonky smiles dunking biscuits in milky tea.\nAre they comfortable there? Of course not. The Saxons aren’t comfortable anywhere. There’s never been a people that squirms so awkwardly inside their own skin. Talking about sex famously throws them into crisis, but so does talking about anything. They sit on trains, silent. On the bus, silent. They spend first dates mutually dabbing at their phones. In the rest of Europe people might go to a restaurant together on their lunch breaks, but not the Saxon, who sits silently by himself on a park bench, eating a packaged sandwich from M&S.

Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn&#8217;t move out of his parents&#8217; home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Li&#232;ge, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour&#8217;s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Li&#232;ge, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana&#8217;s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio T&#233;l&#233;vision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu&#8217;s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of <em>civilisation</em>. </p><p>Ruggiu&#8217;s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he&#8217;d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don&#8217;t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I&#8217;m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I&#8217;m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.</p><p>Anyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, <em>On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation</em>. The appearance raised some hackles&#8212;there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events&#8212;because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/roganverse-split/682593/\">gushed</a> in the <em>Atlantic</em>, finally &#8216;someone had been on Joe Rogan&#8217;s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.&#8217; Murray&#8217;s complaint is that Rogan&#8217;s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the &#8216;chief villain&#8217; of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place &#8216;because the Germans didn&#8217;t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,&#8217; and that Nazi-occupied Europe was &#8216;infinitely preferable in every way&#8217; to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world&#8217;s most popular podcast, but he&#8217;s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers <em>lack the proper credentials</em>. &#8216;My point is, this is not a serious historian. He&#8217;s not a historian.&#8217; Later: &#8216;He&#8217;s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives&#8230; I think it&#8217;s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.&#8217; Another guest asks: &#8216;What&#8217;s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?&#8217; Murray snaps back: &#8216;I think authority matters.&#8217;</p><p>One reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you&#8217;re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don&#8217;t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray&#8217;s books for anything of intellectual merit. They&#8217;re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets. </p><p>The other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it <em>on the Joe Rogan show</em>. I&#8217;m not a listener, because I&#8217;m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you&#8217;re not really <em>listening</em>; you&#8217;re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you&#8217;re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I&#8217;m aware of what Rogan <em>is</em>. He has the world&#8217;s most popular podcast because he&#8217;s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we&#8217;re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/ancient-apocalypse-netflix-why-graham-hancock-thinks-everything/\">I interviewed Graham Hancock</a> for the <em>Telegraph</em> a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England&#8217;s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they&#8217;re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It&#8217;s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it&#8217;s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don&#8217;t blame Rogan for this; he&#8217;s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.</p><p>Of course, Douglas Murray couldn&#8217;t say any of this. He couldn&#8217;t make the obvious argument&#8212;that the problem is <em>genocide denialism</em>, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials&#8212;because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He&#8217;s busy denying the genocide that&#8217;s happening right now. And he knows it.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There are many reasons <em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here&#8217;s a sample passage. Murray&#8217;s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what&#8217;s coming. &#8216;There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.&#8217; It&#8217;s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not <em>technically</em> lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that&#8217;s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic &#8216;spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.&#8217; Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it&#8217;s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Among the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.</p></li><li><p>Democracies are good.</p></li><li><p>Death cults are evil. More than that, they&#8217;re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were <em>not</em> a death cult, because they at least &#8216;sought to cover over their crimes,&#8217; which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: &#8216;Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.&#8217; Later: &#8216;Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.&#8217; Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.</p></li><li><p>Israel is a democracy.</p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s opponents&#8212;that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they&#8217;re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe&#8212;are death cults.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, the war in Gaza is a &#8216;fight between good and evil,&#8217; and we should support Israel.</p></li></ol><p>But this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn&#8217;t bother to actually make this argument; instead of <em>saying</em> any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the &#8216;death cult&#8217; that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of &#8216;democracy.&#8217; At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, &#8216;What Happened,&#8217; is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, &#8216;What I Saw,&#8217; is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, &#8216;How the World Turned,&#8217; is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, &#8216;The Disconnect,&#8217; is appropriately named, because it&#8217;s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, &#8216;From Defeat into Victory,&#8217; is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s essentially it.</p><p>Along the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren&#8217;t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. &#8216;We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.&#8217; (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn&#8217;t assume he&#8217;s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein&#8217;s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it&#8217;s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, <em>Israel Hayom</em>, <em>Arutz Sheva</em>, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn&#8217;t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which &#8216;makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.&#8217;</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair. I don&#8217;t disagree with Murray about <em>everything</em>. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/but-not-like-this\">as I wrote at the time</a>, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his &#8216;death cult&#8217; category, but maybe we should consider it. It can&#8217;t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let&#8217;s start there.</p><p>What does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he&#8217;d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that &#8216;we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left&#8230; I killed a girl, she was 12, but I&#8217;m looking for a baby.&#8217; The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they&#8217;d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren&#8217;t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the <em>rapists </em>be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. &#8216;If he is a Zionist,&#8217; said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, &#8216;everything is legitimate to do! Everything!&#8217; And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren&#8217;t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. &#8216;They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.&#8217;</p><p>I could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let&#8217;s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be&#8217;er Sheva, and it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">endorsed</a> by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn&#8217;t say &#8216;death to the Jews&#8217; but &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/17/miami-shooting-israeli-men\">death to the Arabs</a>.&#8217; Those children were picked off by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html\">Israeli snipers</a>. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: &#8216;This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don&#8217;t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?&#8217; Well: good question.</p><p>If we accept Murray&#8217;s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, <em>also</em> a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There&#8217;s no history. It&#8217;s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.</p><p>It should not be so easy to rip apart Murray&#8217;s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?</p><p>This is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the &#8216;Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.&#8217; But he&#8217;s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, &#8216;they did not mention that these &#8220;journalists&#8221; were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.&#8217; Well, Douglas, the reason they don&#8217;t mention it is that it&#8217;s <em>not true</em>. The journalists were using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/\">an ordinary commercial drone</a> to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/en-journalists-drones-israeli-army-gaza/\">habitually kills</a> journalists who do this.) What&#8217;s Murray&#8217;s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that <em>one in every two houses in Gaza</em> contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it&#8217;d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas&#8217;s extraordinary state capacity. Murray&#8217;s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There&#8217;s cream dripping off his chin. </p><p>The reason he does all this is that he is <em>an asset</em>. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray&#8217;s in Israel, he&#8217;s not <em>finding things out for himself</em>; he&#8217;s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn&#8217;t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he&#8217;s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let <em>anyone</em> wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> (What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There&#8217;s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they&#8217;re just evil. He literally says this. &#8216;There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition&#8212;to take away life.&#8217;) The Netanyahu government has even given him <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-796234\">a special award</a> for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that &#8216;Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.&#8217; He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.</p><p>I think Herzog was wrong. Murray&#8217;s toadying comes at the <em>cost</em> of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely <em>bad</em> advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs <em>or</em> Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he&#8217;s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn&#8217;t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he&#8217;s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him. </p><p><em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> reached number 1 on the <em>Sunday Times</em> bestseller list. It got the second spot on the <em>New York Times</em>&#8217;. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can&#8217;t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?</p><p>I do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There&#8217;s evil in me as well. I&#8217;m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I&#8217;m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th&#8212;and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since&#8212;have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone&#8217;s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our &#8216;search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,&#8217; which is why we&#8217;re &#8216;missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.&#8217; Instead of trying to <em>understand</em> anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on <em>Power Rangers</em>. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that&#8217;s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t think Murray really <em>believes</em> in this infantile moral universe he&#8217;s conjured. That&#8217;s for his readers. <em>He</em> is secretly on the side of the death cults.</p><p>The official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that&#8217;s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is <em>better</em> than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they&#8217;re nineteen years old. &#8216;It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like&#8212;and act like&#8212;children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.&#8217; (Big talk from a man who&#8217;s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli &#220;berfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? &#8216;Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as &#8220;war doesn&#8217;t solve anything.&#8221;&#8217; He&#8217;s not wrong! If you&#8217;re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don&#8217;t have that luxury either; they&#8217;re routinely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/it-is-a-time-of-witch-hunts-in-israel-teacher-held-in-solitary-confinement-for-posting-concern-about-gaza-deaths\">arrested</a> for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.</p><p>But Murray&#8217;s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn&#8217;t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. &#8216;Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.&#8217; I&#8217;m not sure how this counts as being &#8216;driven mad by war,&#8217; but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;m interested in, because I&#8217;ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-crab\">slowly dying in a hospital ward</a>, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don&#8217;t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like &#8216;Death to the Arabs&#8217; and &#8216;Gaza must be made uninhabitable&#8217; and &#8216;Blot out the tribe of Amalek.&#8217; Ah! Sanity!</p><p>Clearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its <em>proximity to war</em>. In his introduction, he writes that &#8216;perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.&#8217; This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can&#8217;t be greater than the thing itself. &#8216;Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.&#8217; Murray has to talk like this because he&#8217;s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he&#8217;s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he&#8217;s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it&#8217;s no longer a martial civilisation; it&#8217;s &#8216;entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.&#8217; America, meanwhile, has &#8216;friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.&#8217; But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel <em>because it&#8217;s one of his death cults</em>. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s <em>ignorant</em> about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler&#8217;s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It&#8217;s usually something similarly tedious, but I&#8217;m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it&#8217;s failed. Listen, Douglas&#8212;can I call you Doug?&#8212;listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they <em>do not respect you</em>. They&#8217;ll invite you for dinner and they&#8217;ll give you awards, they&#8217;ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn&#8217;t fool them. They&#8217;re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Being this much of a hater requires time and money</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>To be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Reviewed: On Democracies and Death Cults(book, Douglas Murray, London, 2025)\nDemocracy (political form, Solon the Lawgiver, Athens, 594 BC)\nDeath cult (attitude before the unknowable, unknown early humans, Qafzeh cave, Israel, 100,000 BC)\nDouglas Murray (contemptible little freak, Mr and Mrs Murray, London, 1979)\n\nGeorges Ruggiu is a former special needs teacher from a small town in the south of Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn’t move out of his parents’ home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Liège, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour’s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Liège, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana’s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu’s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of civilisation.\nRuggiu’s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he’d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don’t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I’m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I’m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.\nAnyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation. The appearance raised some hackles—there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events—because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis gushed in the Atlantic, finally ‘someone had been on Joe Rogan’s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.’ Murray’s complaint is that Rogan’s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the ‘chief villain’ of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place ‘because the Germans didn’t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,’ and that Nazi-occupied Europe was ‘infinitely preferable in every way’ to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world’s most popular podcast, but he’s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers lack the proper credentials. ‘My point is, this is not a serious historian. He’s not a historian.’ Later: ‘He’s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives… I think it’s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.’ Another guest asks: ‘What’s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?’ Murray snaps back: ‘I think authority matters.’\nOne reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you’re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don’t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray’s books for anything of intellectual merit. They’re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets.\nThe other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it on the Joe Rogan show. I’m not a listener, because I’m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you’re not really listening; you’re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you’re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I’m aware of what Rogan is. He has the world’s most popular podcast because he’s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we’re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, I interviewed Graham Hancock for the Telegraph a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England’s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they’re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It’s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it’s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don’t blame Rogan for this; he’s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.\nOf course, Douglas Murray couldn’t say any of this. He couldn’t make the obvious argument—that the problem is genocide denialism, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials—because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He’s busy denying the genocide that’s happening right now. And he knows it.\nSubscribe now\nThere are many reasons On Democracies and Death Cults is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here’s a sample passage. Murray’s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what’s coming. ‘There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,’ he writes, ‘and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.’ It’s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not technically lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that’s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic ‘spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.’ Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it’s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:\n\nAmong the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.\n\nDemocracies are good.\n\nDeath cults are evil. More than that, they’re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were not a death cult, because they at least ‘sought to cover over their crimes,’ which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: ‘Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.’ Later: ‘Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.’ Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.\n\nIsrael is a democracy.\n\nIsrael’s opponents—that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they’re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe—are death cults.\n\nTherefore, the war in Gaza is a ‘fight between good and evil,’ and we should support Israel.\nBut this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn’t bother to actually make this argument; instead of saying any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the ‘death cult’ that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of ‘democracy.’ At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, ‘What Happened,’ is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, ‘What I Saw,’ is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, ‘How the World Turned,’ is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, ‘The Disconnect,’ is appropriately named, because it’s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, ‘From Defeat into Victory,’ is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn’t. That’s essentially it.\nAlong the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren’t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. ‘We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.’ (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn’t assume he’s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein’s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it’s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, Israel Hayom, Arutz Sheva, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn’t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which ‘makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.’\nMaybe I’m being unfair. I don’t disagree with Murray about everything. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, as I wrote at the time, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious. 1 Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his ‘death cult’ category, but maybe we should consider it. It can’t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let’s start there.\nWhat does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he’d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that ‘we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left… I killed a girl, she was 12, but I’m looking for a baby.’ The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they’d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren’t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the rapists be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. ‘If he is a Zionist,’ said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, ‘everything is legitimate to do! Everything!’ And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren’t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. ‘They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,’ he wrote, ‘but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.’\nI could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let’s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be’er Sheva, and it was endorsed by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’ but ‘ death to the Arabs.’ Those children were picked off by Israeli snipers. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: ‘This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don’t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?’ Well: good question.\nIf we accept Murray’s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, also a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There’s no history. It’s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.\nIt should not be so easy to rip apart Murray’s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?\nThis is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the ‘Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.’ But he’s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, ‘they did not mention that these “journalists” were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.’ Well, Douglas, the reason they don’t mention it is that it’s not true. The journalists were using an ordinary commercial drone to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel habitually kills journalists who do this.) What’s Murray’s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that one in every two houses in Gaza contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it’d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas’s extraordinary state capacity. Murray’s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There’s cream dripping off his chin.\nThe reason he does all this is that he is an asset. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray’s in Israel, he’s not finding things out for himself; he’s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn’t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he’s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let anyone wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message. 2(What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There’s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they’re just evil. He literally says this. ‘There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition—to take away life.’) The Netanyahu government has even given him a special award for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that ‘Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.’ He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.\nI think Herzog was wrong. Murray’s toadying comes at the cost of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely bad advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs or Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he’s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn’t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he’s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him.\nOn Democracies and Death Cults reached number 1 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. It got the second spot on the New York Times ’. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can’t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?\nI do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There’s evil in me as well. I’m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I’m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th—and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since—have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone’s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our ‘search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,’ which is why we’re ‘missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.’ Instead of trying to understand anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on Power Rangers. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that’s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.\nBut I don’t think Murray really believes in this infantile moral universe he’s conjured. That’s for his readers. He is secretly on the side of the death cults.\nThe official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that’s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is better than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they’re nineteen years old. ‘It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like—and act like—children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.’ (Big talk from a man who’s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli Überfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? ‘Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as “war doesn’t solve anything.”’ He’s not wrong! If you’re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don’t have that luxury either; they’re routinely arrested for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.\nBut Murray’s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn’t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. ‘Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.’ I’m not sure how this counts as being ‘driven mad by war,’ but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It’s one I’m interested in, because I’ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother slowly dying in a hospital ward, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I’ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don’t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like ‘Death to the Arabs’ and ‘Gaza must be made uninhabitable’ and ‘Blot out the tribe of Amalek.’ Ah! Sanity!\nClearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its proximity to war. In his introduction, he writes that ‘perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.’ This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can’t be greater than the thing itself. ‘Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.’ Murray has to talk like this because he’s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he’s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he’s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it’s no longer a martial civilisation; it’s ‘entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.’ America, meanwhile, has ‘friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.’ But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel because it’s one of his death cults. I don’t think he’s ignorant about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide. 3 All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler’s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.\nI don’t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that’s why he’s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It’s usually something similarly tedious, but I’m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it’s failed. Listen, Douglas—can I call you Doug?—listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they do not respect you. They’ll invite you for dinner and they’ll give you awards, they’ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn’t fool them. They’re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady.\n\n\n\n\nBeing this much of a hater requires time and money\n\n\n\n1\n\nTo be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me. In the recent flare-up between India and Pakistan, a surprising number of people have started taking the view that India=Israel and Pakistan=Palestine, and decided that the progressive position is to support Pakistan. But unlike the Palestinians, the Pakistanis have a state. A misshapen, psychotic, repressive, sectarian state, deformed forever by the bloody circumstances of its birth, which committed its own genocide in 1971, and which has nuclear weapons. India is hardly any better. As I wrote when I was over there, for the sake of the people of South Asia both countries must be abolished.\n2\n\nIn her Atlantic piece, Helen Lewis tries to have a pop at the comedian Tim Dillon, who wondered how Murray manages to get into all these places. ‘How is he in all these wars? Can I just go to wars?’ Lewis replies: ‘Yes, Tim Dillon, you can. That’s what all of those people on your television with WAR REPORTER written under their name have been doing. In the olden days, we had a tradition where people who wanted to find out stuff spoke directly with people who had firsthand information. You guys laughed at it and said that it was dumb and elitist.’ No, Helen Lewis, you can’t. Try going to any of these places without being personally vetted and approved by the IDF—sorry, the ‘people with firsthand information’—and see what happens.\n3\n\nIf there was ever a case for scepticism on this point, it’s gone. Nineteen months of Israeli officials announcing their intent to depopulate Gaza; two months since Israel unilaterally broke the ceasefire, blocked all food, and started starving the population. You don’t get to pretend that the war is only against Hamas. But why should they let the people of Gaza have food, when they’re fighting them in a war? Excellent point. It’s just the same excellent point that Suharto made about East Timor, and the Nigerian generals made about Biafra, and the Ethiopians and Eritreans made about Tigray just a few years ago. The name for what those people did is genocide.",

I could tell you that my girlfriend got me into it, and I wouldn&#8217;t even be lying, but this is the kind of thing men say to avoid acknowledging that they&#8217;ve been enjoying something they&#8217;re not really meant to enjoy. And I really am enjoying Married at First Sight Australia, or at least I was until I encountered Tommy. </p><p>If you haven&#8217;t seen Married at First Sight Australia, the gimmick of the show is summed up in the title. Every year we meet about a dozen couples, all of whom are supposedly here because they&#8217;re sick of modern dating, ghosting, situationships, etc. Instead, they&#8217;ve decided to try an arranged marriage organised by a TV production company called Endemol Shine. Like all good reality shows, MAFSA is relentlessly heteronormative. There are men and women. The women have all had various terrifying plastic surgeries to turn them into Pixar characters. They do skincare routines that leave their faces always looking slightly wet, like they&#8217;re still encased in their protective gel. If you cut into them they&#8217;d be skin-coloured and gummy-textured all the way through. The women are all relatively successful in life, business owners, high-powered professionals, but you get the sense that appearing on this show is their last-ditch effort, one final attempt at heterosexuality before they give up entirely. If it doesn&#8217;t work out they&#8217;ll spend the rest of their lives applying face masks and drinking ros&#233; in their plush velvet Melbourne apartments, e-commerce anchoresses, peaceably alone. A surprising number of them have never had a serious relationship in their lives. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re obviously deeply mentally unstable, but most of the time it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re smart, smart enough to see through the attempted manipulations of the leery dullheaded Australian men that are their sexual peers, smart enough to know when someone is trying to drag them into a purgatorial realm of frequent but indifferent sex with no obligations attached, and smart enough to pick an evening with the face mask and the ros&#233; instead. So they go on the show that promises to let them skip past all that bullshit, for the small price of turning themselves into mass entertainment.</p><p>That&#8217;s the women. The men are trickier. Men don&#8217;t watch stuff like MAFSA unless prodded into it by their girlfriends, and the one thing all the men on the show have in common is that they don&#8217;t have girlfriends. What kind of man ends up on a TV show that&#8217;s so fundamentally <em>for women</em>? Actually, there&#8217;s a very simple explanation. The men are on the show because they&#8217;ve noticed that if you go on there and manage to stick it out for a month or two, you will get one hundred thousand Instagram followers, and then you can spend the rest of your life doing sponsored content and making paid appearances at nightclubs on the Gold Coast. This is the source of the show&#8217;s dramatic tension. The producers help where they can, with a few gimmicky exercises to tear their couples apart&#8212;most marriages don&#8217;t involve the groom having to rank all of his wife&#8217;s friends by physical attractiveness&#8212;and I&#8217;m sure the editors are sneakily recutting everything that happens into a fantasy narrative that barely resembles actual events, but the real load-bearing simulation is performed by the cast themselves. The men have to keep up the impression that they&#8217;ve got a profound romantic chemistry with this woman they&#8217;ve just met. At the weekly dinner parties, the men brutally police each other for any slips. They&#8217;re all primly appalled when any other man seems to be disrespecting his wife. But over time, the mask inevitably slips. Almost all the couples stop having sex within the first few weeks. The women are left to slowly go crazy, trying not to recognise what they&#8217;ve secretly known all along: that this man they&#8217;ve been sharing a bed with simply does not care if they live or die.</p><p>But I think what keeps me watching this thing isn&#8217;t even so much the marriages at first sight as the Australia. There&#8217;s a British version of the show; it&#8217;s just not the same. British people are ugly. Our features are all squished together. Even with the plastic surgery we&#8217;re not gloriously synthetic like the Australians; we look like bog mutants. Inbred, floppy-lipped, small bitter eyes. The houses we live in are poky and cold. Our economy is contracting. Our skies are grey. Our island is small. Meanwhile Australia is, as far as I can tell, a kind of heaven, all green and lush and prosperous. Incredible that we used to send convicts there. Every so often British people get sick of being miserable and decide to move to Australia, and when you talk to them afterwards they&#8217;re almost giddy with it. Do you have any idea how much higher the salaries are here? And what you can get for the price of a mildewing flat in Deptford? And how nice it feels to live in a country that isn&#8217;t visibly going to the dogs? Yes, we do go surfing. We go surfing on Christmas. We eat huge thick steaks in our air-conditioned homes, in our golden philistine dreamworld on the opposite side of the planet, where people walk with their feet pointing up and their heads pointing down.</p><p>Australia hovered in the European imagination long before we ever set foot there. The Greeks and the Romans knew that the earth was round, and they could calculate what portion of the sphere was occupied by the world they knew: there must be something on the other side. A <em>terra australis incognita</em>. Pliny never doubted that it was inhabited. &#8216;We maintain that there are men dispersed over every part of the earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to tread equally on the middle of the earth. If anyone should ask why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do not fall.&#8217; The Australians are our opposites, sitting under similar skies, making calculations. In the <em>Chorographia</em> of Pomponius Mela, he begins by pointing out that the earth has two inhabitable zones, layered between the two icy poles and the unbearable heat of the torrid equator. &#8216;The Antichthones inhabit one, we the other. The chorography of the former zone is unknown because of the heat of the intervening expanse, and the chorography of the latter is now to be described.&#8217; He then spends the rest of his book talking about the world he knows, although he does speculate that the Nile might have its source in the other world, on the other side. </p><p>Christianity complicated things. For Christians, humanity has one origin, at Eden. Since Eden is somewhere in the northern hemisphere, and it&#8217;s impossible to pass through the deadly heat of the equator, the antipodes must be uninhabited. Augustine has no time for &#8216;the fable that there are antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, that is on no ground credible.&#8217; Yes, the earth is a sphere, but &#8216;it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture gives no false information, and it is too absurd to say that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other.&#8217; Thomas Aquinas also rejected the antipodes. In his <em>Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate</em>, he refutes the idea that a just God would not consign unbelievers to Hell when they&#8217;d never even heard the Gospel. He does this by simply insisting that everyone in the world <em>has</em> heard the Gospel, even in the furthest pagan lands, and rejected it. Even if someone were &#8216;brought up in the forest or among wolves,&#8217; God would &#8216;send some preacher of the faith to him as he sent Peter to Cornelius.&#8217; But since no one from the Christian world can reach the antipodes, God would not have put anyone there at all.</p><p>One interesting compromise was proposed by the Dominican friar Egbert of Hereford. Australia, he suggests, is a mirror of the known world, except that their sun rises when ours sets. When you go to sleep and dream, another version of yourself is waking up in Australia. His country is brighter than yours, animal symbols and primary colours. When he goes to sleep again you remember his life, just for a moment, and then it evaporates.</p><p>For centuries, despite the stern theological arguments of Augustine and Aquinas, <em>Terra Australis Incognita</em> continued to appear on maps and globes, pretty much exactly where Australia actually lies. We knew it was there, with a knowledge that drew from sources other than reason. And then, in the seventeeth century, we finally set eyes on the continent we&#8217;d been imagining for two millennia. It was real, and it was populated, by maybe the most fascinating people on earth. The Australians had split off from the rest of humanity more than fifty thousand years ago. They had sailed across palaeolithic oceans, long before anyone else had developed any kind of open-water navigation. As far as we know, when they set out humanity had yet to produce any representational art. We had not yet learned to create fire at will. Some of the more sophisticated flint-knapped tools had yet to be invented. But the Australians had boats. Then, once they arrived, they decided to forget all their impossibly advanced technology and never took to the seas again. In the time since then, as the rest of the world churned with constant migrations and population replacements, waves of farmers and pastoralists sweeping across the earth and exterminating each other, the Australians stayed exactly where they were. Across deserts and jungles and dozens of separate language families, they maintained a single pan-continental religious structure held together by the songlines that cross the land from coast to coast. The Australians believed in animal symbols. They believed that the world came out of a dream.</p><p>And then, in 1788, a group of people who, just yesterday, were wandering pastoralist herdsmen on the Russian steppes, intruded on that world at Botany Bay. They had come to this sacred place on the underside of the world because they wanted to use it as a prison for petty thieves. Within a millisecond, almost all the Australians were dead, and the Yamnaya herdsmen had built something else over their graves, a sunnier, dumber version of Britain thrown up on an imaginary continent, where they say things like &#8216;fair suck of the sav&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not here to fuck spiders,&#8217; and end their sentences with &#8216;hey,&#8217; and throw prawns on the barbie, and marry each other at first sight.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Anyway, in the most recent season of Married at First Sight Australia we&#8217;re introduced to Tommy, 31. Tommy lives in Wollongong, New South Wales, where he works as a surf instructor. He has close-cropped blond hair and Polynesian tattoos all the way up to his jawline, and when he takes off his shirt roughly ten seconds into his introductory segment we can see that he also has a set of perfect, plastic, creatine abs. A silver cross dangles from his earring. People see me and they make all kind of assumptions, he says. But I don&#8217;t drink, I&#8217;ve never taken drugs, really I&#8217;m just a mummy&#8217;s boy. Shot of Tommy running out of the surf, whooping like a madman. It feels like modern dating is all about going to clubs, he says, getting pissed every night, I&#8217;m not about that. Shot of Tommy in the gym, lifting, then with his arm round another beautifully muscled man who is presumably his friend or maybe just someone the producers brought along. </p><p>One thing that&#8217;s unique about Tommy is that family is so important to him. We visit his mother&#8217;s bungalow in Albion Park. She is a very alarming woman to look at, partly because her flesh is lumpy and loose and folded so that she resembles a particularly inbred dog, and partly because she&#8217;s dressed like a clown. She&#8217;s wearing a diaphanous teal pierrot blouse and her hair in a purple bob. Big splotches of rouge on her cheeks. She seems like a nice person. She&#8217;s telling the cameras that her son&#8217;s always been the most perfect gentleman but if anything he dotes on her <em>too</em> much, so she hopes he finds a nice girl who might take him off her hands. She cackles. But at this point I&#8217;m not listening to her, because in amongst all the piled-up tat that crowds Tommy&#8217;s mum&#8217;s house I&#8217;ve caught a glimpse of something I recognise. I have to rewind and pause on exactly the right frame. It&#8217;s an oil painting, in profile, of a thuggish-looking man uncomfortably wrapped in a nineteenth-century suit. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen this man, in relation to something I was reading about. He doesn&#8217;t look like a writer. I take a photo of the screen and reverse image search and yes, it is, it&#8217;s Jacob Mudie, the failed explorer. It&#8217;s the same portrait that illustrates his Wikipedia page. A bit of Googling reveals that yes, Tommy from MAFS is, in fact, the great-great-great-great-grandson of Jacob Mudie on his mother&#8217;s side.</p><p>Not many people remember the Mudie Expedition.  We like hearing about tragic failures; sometimes we&#8217;ll settle for a success; the Mudie Expedition was neither. It is not particularly important in the history of Australia, but it does have a minor place in the history of madness.</p><p>The story goes that during the first phase of settlement in Australia, the European colonists kept to their fertile strip around the eastern edge of the continent, hemmed in by the Great Dividing Range and the vast dry bush beyond. They had the sea, which connected them to the rest of the world; that was what mattered. But in the 1850s, people started wrapping the world in copper wire. If Australia was going to thrive, it needed to be connected to the global telegraph network, and that would mean stringing a cable all the way across the interior of the continent, from the cities in the southeastern corner to the Top End near what&#8217;s now Darwin, and from there on to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the world. The man chosen to plot a route through the wilderness was a furious Scot named Jacob Mudie. Mudie had got his start as a surveyor in the Highlands during the Clearances, mapping out Hebridean crofts on behalf of Sir John Powlett Orde, Second Baronet Orde. There was a potato famine; the people were half-starved. Curious pattern of wounds and broken skin around the fingertips. Mudie&#8217;s job was to map the plots these people would shortly be losing, but something else happened while he was there, some incident with a daughter of Clan MacEachen; a limp body left on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Mudie fled to Australia. He mapped out a claim in Djadjawurrung country, which happened to be the only plot of land in Victoria without a speck of gold in it. He continued to range and survey while his wife and two daughters chewed on warrigal greens and bark. Another incident. Some of the Djadjawurrung wandered onto his land to hunt and he laid them out flat on the ground for the Border Police. When the police sought out their camp, the womenfolk were all dead too, slumped over the fire, hair singed. His personal conduct was less than ideal, but Mudie was the man for the job. He could speak a few words of Wemba-Wemba and Barrabool, he could handle himself with the Brown Bess as well as he could a theodolite, and he was willing to walk out into the centre of Australia in return for a share in the telegraph company. In September 1857 he departed from Melbourne with six Irish porters and a train of donkeys, off into the interior. </p><p>He did not return in 1858, which is when he was expected. He also did not return in 1859. In 1860, the Royal Society of Victoria commissioned the much more extensive Burke and Wills Expedition, which set out with nineteen men, twenty-three horses, twenty-six camels driven by Pashtun camel-drivers shipped over from the fringes of British India, and two years&#8217; worth of food. In 1861, three colonies sent out rescue expeditions to search for Burke and Wills, and ended up finding their bones. In 1862, five years after he set out, Jacob Mudie returned to Melbourne. Naked and sun-scorched, lines of livid red cracking open his back, lips black and gummy, nose shrivelled, mucous lining black, conjunctiva black, feet bursting with open sores. He was raving. </p><p>He had not reached the other shore; the Irish porters had all died and so had the donkeys, but he had walked across the desert to the dead centre of Australia, and in that centre he had found an inland sea. He&#8217;d even mapped it. But what really mattered wasn&#8217;t the sea. He had learned something in the outback. It had been revealed to him that as soon as Captain Cook had come ashore at Botany Bay, he said, he had fallen asleep and dreamed that he was walking around, surveying hills and harbours. And when the First Fleet arrived they had also fallen asleep, on the ground where they landed, under the open sky, dreaming that they were founding a colony. Then the Second Fleet came to sleep right next to them. From the start of the Gold Rush, boatloads of immigrants had been arriving in Port Phillip, all of them pouring out onto the soft green ground, and immediately collapsing into a deep, deep, motionless sleep. This city, Mudie said, is a dream, it&#8217;s a desert mirage, all Australia is a dream, we have trespassed on our dreamworld, and the only thing any white or Chinaman can do here is sleep! Mudie was confined in the Yarra Bend Asylum for Idiots and Imbeciles. He took few visitors. Sometimes his wife would try to see him, and he would point in her face, all scornful, and say: Asleep. He died in 1882. </p><p>The map he produced, of the inland sea at the heart of Australia, is still in the archives of the Melbourne Museum. It&#8217;s drawn with precision. Calculations pencilled in the fringes. The coastline of his inland sea is rugged, fjorded; it follows the exact contours of the west coast of Scotland.</p><p>Jacob Mudie&#8217;s great-great-great-great-grandson is about to be married at first sight to Alyssa, 28, from Sydney. Alyssa is plastic, attractive, bottle-blonde, urn-shaped face, subtle fillers, mesomorph. She was born in Egypt but came to Australia when she was a baby. She works in market research, and the gimmick for her introductory segment is that it&#8217;s framed like she&#8217;s doing market research for herself as a romantic partner, but even though she has so much love to give no one wants a loyal woman with old-fashioned values any more. She has never had a serious long-term relationship in her life. She wants to be in love. One thing that&#8217;s unique about Alyssa is that family is so important to her. We see her phoning up her dad to tell him the good news. I&#8217;m getting married, she squeals. Her father is delighted. He wants to know everything. Who is the man? Where&#8217;s he from? Is he Coptic? How did they meet? Is he Coptic? Does he go to church? Is he Coptic? Well, says Alyssa, I haven&#8217;t actually met him yet. I&#8217;m going on MAFS. Mafs, says her dad, what is mafs? She tells him. There&#8217;s a long pause. No, he says. No, no, no, no, no. </p><p>Alyssa and Tommy are married in a little wooded dell overlooking Sydney Harbour. There&#8217;s a wedding arch made from fake white roses. Tommy breaks into a big grin when he sees her walking up the aisle. Wow, he says, you&#8217;re stunning, hey? Later the producers interview her under some eucalypts. He&#8217;s toooo handsome, she complains, like I&#8217;m just standing here like, how am I going to mess this up? I&#8217;m really freaking out now! You should have given me someone less handsome to take the pressure off! But later at the reception she suddenly breaks into tears. Two friends have come to her wedding, but all of her family have boycotted the event. This is my <em>wedding</em>, she keeps saying. I spent my whole childhood dreaming of this day. I never ever imagined my family wouldn&#8217;t be here. Tommy tries to comfort her. I&#8217;m sorta your family now, hey? he says, and puts an arm over her shoulder. She screams and flicks his hand off of her like it&#8217;s an enormous spider, and sinks back into her tears. They do not have sex on their wedding night. </p><p>For their honeymoon, the pair are sent to a wellness retreat in the desert outside Alice Springs, right in the centre of Australia. Stone Buddha heads, gravel raked into a yin and yang. We see them lying in shivasana, but Tommy keeps poking Alyssa in the shoulder while she tries not to laugh. They go for a dip in Ellery Creek and Tommy shrieks at the cold. Ooh, my little fella&#8217;s curled right up! he says. Later we see them over dinner. The musical score mocks Tommy as he insists on saying grace over their pad ka prow. Lord, he says, thank you for this food you have given us from your bounty, and thank you for bringing me my beautiful wife Alyssa, so we can honour your commandments&#8230; Alyssa side-eyes the camera. Cut to Alyssa, talking head. I mean, I&#8217;m Christian, she says. But Tommy&#8217;s like, <em>Christian</em> Christian. Back to the table. Can we eat now? says Alyssa. But Tommy&#8217;s still going. He&#8217;s asking God to look after his mother while he&#8217;s away in the NT. And then he asks God to check in on Alyssa&#8217;s parents too, and prays that He&#8217;ll remove the scales from their eyes so they&#8217;ll accept him as their son-in-law. He thinks he&#8217;s just delivered a coup. Alyssa smiles, weakly. Cut to talking head. That is honestly just so, so disrespectful, she says. Don&#8217;t talk about my family, ok? Don&#8217;t talk about them to your mates, don&#8217;t talk about them to your mum, and don&#8217;t you dare talk about my family to God. They do not have sex on the first night of their honeymoon.</p><p>On the second day they go for a hike out in the desert. Creepy jagged rock formations peering over the spinifex plains. Ghost gums twisting spindly between the sun-blackened stones. Tommy&#8217;s wearing a cork hat. He thinks it&#8217;s hilarious. He keeps making little jokes to Alyssa and she barely responds. You know what, he says suddenly, [bleep] this. I tried, alright? I really tried. He suddenly starts marching away from her. Intensely dramatic music, epic fantasy battle music. Cut to steadicam footage as one of the cameramen tries to follow him. Just [bleep] <em>off</em>, Tommy says, and breaks into a run. He&#8217;s very fit. Cut to night. Alyssa&#8217;s back at the resort. She&#8217;s crying. I scared him off, she said, this is what I always do, I drive people away. Meanwhile helicopters are in the air, searchlights on, looking for Tommy in endless miles of empty outback. Somewhere out there, Tommy is falling into the infinite centre of everything. They do not have sex on the second night of their honeymoon.</p><p>He returns the next day. I just needed time to clear my head, he tells the camera. He says that while he was gone he gained the clarity he needed, and now he&#8217;s ready to really commit to his relationship with Alyssa. But he seems different; there&#8217;s a new interior distance in him. Something as endless as the desert seems to stare out through his eyes. The camera follows Tommy as he bounds up to the suite and knocks on the door. Alyssa opens. Pale without her makeup. She doesn&#8217;t seem surprised to see him. You came back, she said. Yeah, says Tommy. He grabs a beer out the minibar and sits down heavily on the sofa. A small cloud of dust rises off his body. Alyssa doesn&#8217;t say anything. That night, Tommy and Alyssa have sex for the first time. </p><p>They move into a sleek, velvet, neutral-toned apartment in Sydney. Now it&#8217;s been consummated, Alyssa seems incredibly enthusiastic about their marriage. She keeps calling him hubby, hubbo, sometimes hubbs. He&#8217;s speaking less and less. The first argument happens while they&#8217;re still unpacking. Alyssa picks up their wedding photo and says she wants to put it by her bedside. Tommy is folding tshirts while staring straight ahead. His eyes seem to be tunnelling down into his skull. Sure, he says. This makes Alyssa upset, because she thinks he ought to want to put the photo on <em>his</em> bedside. I keep giving you these opportunities to show up for me, she says, to let me know you care about me, and all you do is go <em>uh, yeah, sure</em>. Different people show up in different ways, says Tommy. But I&#8217;m asking you to show up for me in the way I need you to show up for me, says Alyssa. Yeah, well I&#8217;m not a mind reader, hey? says Tommy. You don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to be a mind reader, says Alyssa, you just need to stop deflecting and let me feel heard, and if I feel heard then you&#8217;ll know how to show up for me! Right, says Tommy, so how do you want me to show up for you? I want, says Alyssa. She takes a few deep breaths. I want you to show up for me, she says, by making space for my feelings when I need to feel heard. Tommy tries to hug her and she bats him in the head with a flip-flop.</p><p>At the first dinner party Tommy wears an oversized white suit jacket with blue chinos and a blue string vest. Alyssa is loosely wrapped in a kind of large lime-green taffeta ribbon. During the dinner, Craig starts laying into Tommy. You&#8217;ve got a beautiful, stunning woman there, he says, but I can tell she&#8217;s not being shown up for. Tommy and Alyssa are one of the two major dramas of the evening; the other is that Craig was caught texting his ex during his own honeymoon in Fiji. But now the spotlight&#8217;s on Tommy, Craig is making a meal of it. I can&#8217;t imagine walking out on this gorgeous, beautiful woman, literally walking out on her into the desert, he says. That&#8217;s not how a man shows up. Clara, Craig&#8217;s sharp-nosed wife, sits next to him wearing a look of undisguised rage as he keeps piling compliments on Alyssa. But Tommy isn&#8217;t there. He&#8217;s walking naked along the Bulloo Creek, with six dead Irishmen slung over the backs of the donkeys that plod after him. He&#8217;s learned that the desert has a voice, just not one you can detect with your ears. It teaches you things and then you know them, in the same way that there are things you simply come to know in a dream. The desert told him to take off his clothes. You can not be one with the desert while you still wear your clothes. And once you obey, the desert will be kind to you. It has shown him food. Tommy is gnawing on a thighbone of Irishman and marching naked up the Bulloo Creek to meet his destiny.</p><p>Alyssa has a difficult time at the commitment ceremony. Beforehand she&#8217;s talking to the cameras about how she&#8217;s going to air all her grievances about the way Tommy&#8217;s been mistreating her, but before it&#8217;s her turn Clara starts accusing Alyssa of trying to tempt Craig away from her, which means Alyssa now has to pretend that everything&#8217;s actually going great between her and Tommy, make a show of being all loved up in her new relationship, but the other couples aren&#8217;t buying it. Oh babe, says Joanee, he literally abandoned you in the desert, if my husband did that I&#8217;d never forgive him. Alyssa laughs, throwing her hair back, like it&#8217;s no big deal. We had some problems, yeah, she says. But when he came back he really committed to me, he&#8217;s really shown that, I feel like we&#8217;re in such a good place right now. Tommy sits staring at nothing. He&#8217;s in the flaking eczema scrublands north of Kati Thanda, where salt hollows scar the land under a world-devouring sun. Tommy, says one of the experts, do you think you&#8217;re in a good place right now? Yes, says Tommy. The desert is a mirror. I&#8217;m in a good place, he says. </p><p>Austen says she thinks Alyssa is being gaslit. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m being gaslit, says Alyssa. No but you are, says Austen, he&#8217;s gaslighting you so much you don&#8217;t even realise you&#8217;re being gaslit. I really don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true, says Alyssa. Yeah, says Austen, but babe that&#8217;s not what you actually think, it&#8217;s what he&#8217;s making you think, he&#8217;s literally putting those thoughts inside your head.</p><p>Afterwards Tommy and Alyssa have to reveal the cards on which they&#8217;ve written whether they want to stay with each other, and on the show, or quit. Alyssa has written STAY. She&#8217;s drawn a little heart next to it. I&#8217;ve sacrificed so much to be here, she says, and I want to prove that it&#8217;s possible for anyone of any background to take that step, to be brave and put yourself out there, so I&#8217;m staying. Next Tommy shows his card to the camera. It says SLEEP. You&#8217;ve written sleep, says the expert. Can you tell me what you meant by that? Alyssa&#8217;s inched away from him on the sofa. Why did you write that? she says. What does it mean? What does it <em>mean</em>? Tommy&#8217;s face is motionless. We&#8217;re asleep, he says. He&#8217;s looking straight at the camera. There&#8217;s a mineral glint in his eyes. </p><p>Everywhere in the world except Australia, reality comes out of some conscious act of creation. Yahweh Elohim sits in his throne of storm-clouds and decrees: Let there be light. In Australia, there&#8217;s the Dreaming. A lustrous, hazy, eternal present lying just beneath the surface of every individual moment, where the ancestral spirits wander the formless land and give it shape. This gorge is a footprint being left by Emu in the Emu Dreaming. This waterhole is where he digs. Here Emu is wounded by Eagle and he thrashes around in the dirt, and that creates Kati Thanda. You can track Emu&#8217;s path across the country, see where it intersects with the Eagle Dreaming, the the Dingo Dreaming, the Porcupine Dreaming, the Kangaroo Dreaming. These mountains are Emu where he finally lays down and dies, but there&#8217;s a dark cloud in the Milky Way that is also Emu, pacing between the stars. Every time is the dream time. Tommy is also in a dream, walking across the land and giving it shape. The thin stark telegraph line will lacerate the earth wherever he sets his foot. New electronic songlines unspool behind him. He is walking the Telegraph Dreaming. The Information Dreaming. The Communications Dreaming. The Reality TV Dreaming.</p><p>Since Alyssa has decided to stay, the couple have one more week on the show to try to work things out. This week is Intimacy Week. Alyssa is having an intimacy workshop with the other girls. The other girls are all very slightly frosty to her; they&#8217;ve decided she&#8217;s complicit in her own gaslighting. Meanwhile Alyssa keeps giggling at the sex toys. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m, like, fully comfortable with my sexual side yet, she tells the camera. One of the experts reminds her that intimacy is not the same as sex. It&#8217;s about two people learning to be present and comfortable and vulnerable with one another. For her task, she has to sit facing Tommy, holding hands with him, gazing into his eyes, and ask him four prepared questions about himself. What do you like about me? What makes you nervous? Were you happy as a child? When was the last time you cried, and why? Tommy considers these. What do I like about you, he says. Well first of all you&#8217;ve got a stunning body, that&#8217;s number one. Number two, I think you&#8217;ve got really great values, like family&#8217;s so important to you. Number three&#8230; His jaw rotates soundlessly for a moment. Cut to Alyssa&#8217;s impatient face, waiting. What makes me nervous, Tommy says. Flying, he says. I always get heaps scared when I&#8217;m on a flight. Cut to desaturated footage of Tommy on his honeymoon flight to Alice Springs, chattering happily away. Alyssa is looking furious. Did I have a happy childhood, says Tommy. Flashes of a crofter&#8217;s hovel in the boglands. A happy childhood, he manages again. He is being whipped across the knuckles with a length of heather rope, until all the skin has shredded away. Suddenly a wet howl bursts out of Tommy&#8217;s mouth. Alyssa swoops in to cradle his head. It&#8217;s ok, she says as he cries hot tears into her dress, you&#8217;re safe, I&#8217;ve got you, you can tell me when you&#8217;re ready.</p><p>I feel like we made a really big breakthrough today, she tells the camera later.</p><p>That night Tommy has sex with his wife again. His haunches move like a piston, well-oiled, engineered, and she lies face-down on the bed going unf, unf, unf. He is pushing into the red centre of her body, deeper, deeper, in. The wet polymorphous worldbearing womb. Tommy has walked all the way into the heart of the desert but as far as he walks the centre he&#8217;s after keeps trailing away from him. He ate his porters and he ate the donkeys, even after the meat went rancid. Some of the mobs have fed him and some of the mobs he shot. He smears one hand all over Alyssa&#8217;s face. Grinding hard into the cleft of her arse. Deeper and deeper into the guts of Australia until finally the fundament opens and where there had been one parched and endless desert he&#8217;s now standing naked on a hillside above a slate-grey island-speckled sea.</p><p>It&#8217;s different here, on the secret sea. Around Tommy&#8217;s feet the spinifex fades to gorse, yellower maybe, but it&#8217;s the yellow of old film, colours bleeding dimmer. Yellow of lichen, old newspapers, discoloured teeth. A few purple heath flowers below the cliffs by the sea. There are two black figures down there, naked aboriginals, a man and a woman, hand in hand, picking their way with some difficulty over the cold and slimy rocks. He is aware that their names are Man and Woman. Eventually Man stops his clambering and just steadies himself with his spear, watching Woman as she struggles on ahead. Once there&#8217;s a bit of distance between them he balances the spear in his woomera and flings it. The spear falls like a raindrop, right through Woman&#8217;s body. She lies on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Tommy is erect. He walks down to the shore, which is sandy now, a big broad beach under sandy cliffs with bungalows on top. Sandon Point, Wollongong. Waves look ace. He kneels over the dying Woman and plugs up her wound. He understands it all. It&#8217;s still the show; he&#8217;s dreaming about the show. They say the whole world came out of a dream. That makes perfect sense. Everyone knows what dreams, once you strip away the metaphors, are really all about.</p><p>Anyway, at the start of the next episode, they showed a few brief shots of Tommy and Alyssa&#8217;s empty apartment while the narrator explained that Tommy had to be hospitalised after a medical emergency and would not be returning to the show. According to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Tommy is currently in an acute psychiatric unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Alyssa spent two nights in a trauma ward at the same hospital before being discharged. According to the <em>Mail</em>, she has chosen not to press charges. It was a very sudden end to one of the more promisingly dysfunctional couples on the show, but to be honest I was glad not to have to see them any more. There was something worrying about Tommy and Alyssa, and it wasn&#8217;t just Tommy&#8217;s increasingly odd behaviour. Like I said at the start, it made me enjoy the show a lot less. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but I think it had to do with the <em>way</em> they were presented; my whole viewing experience felt different when I was watching them. For instance, there was one part near the end where I definitely remember seeing Tommy and Alyssa having sex. All the lights were on in their plush millennial-grey bedroom, this really cold white light, almost institutional, and I could see Alyssa&#8217;s red cheeks and the red circles on her slapped arse and Tommy&#8217;s stubbly thighs pumping back and forth, all looking grimly desaturated in that light, totally unerotic, like so many piles of sausages. There wasn&#8217;t any narration. There wasn&#8217;t any music. It lasted for a really long time. I guess it was a kind of glimpse into the reality behind reality TV, without any of the usual manipulative editing or the musical cues that sustain the narrative fantasy and tell you how to feel about it. Except I find it hard to believe that Tommy and Alyssa would have allowed the cameras in there with them, or that a long stark sequence of Tommy emotionlessly fucking Alyssa doggy style would have been cleared for broadcast. To be honest, while I can remember that sequence I don&#8217;t remember watching it <em>on a screen</em>. I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t on my sofa in London when it happened. I wasn&#8217;t watching TV. I wasn&#8217;t grounded in anything physical at all. Where was my girlfriend? The person who got me into this show in the fist place? My own dreamy heterosexual idyll? Dissipated. Sunk back into the sea that birthed her. And this actually happened quite a lot, whenever Tommy was onscreen: I&#8217;d find myself disembodied, watching, <em>knowing </em>certain things about where he was or what he was thinking, even when those things didn&#8217;t really make sense. So in a way I was glad when it was over, even though it&#8217;s obviously awful that Alyssa had to go to hospital. Afterwards the episode continued pretty seamlessly. Justin and Joanee are on the rocks after Joanee accuses Justin of disrespecting her sister. Chardonnay admits she&#8217;s been flirting with one of the other grooms. Shots of traffic moving over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Skyscrapers and eucalyptus trees. The sun&#8217;s always shining over there. Eventually I grew tired. I went to sleep, and dreamed about Australia.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">In dreams, walk with me</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nLately I’ve been watching this reality show called Married at First Sight Australia. I could tell you that my girlfriend got me into it, and I wouldn’t even be lying, but this is the kind of thing men say to avoid acknowledging that they’ve been enjoying something they’re not really meant to enjoy. And I really am enjoying Married at First Sight Australia, or at least I was until I encountered Tommy.\nIf you haven’t seen Married at First Sight Australia, the gimmick of the show is summed up in the title. Every year we meet about a dozen couples, all of whom are supposedly here because they’re sick of modern dating, ghosting, situationships, etc. Instead, they’ve decided to try an arranged marriage organised by a TV production company called Endemol Shine. Like all good reality shows, MAFSA is relentlessly heteronormative. There are men and women. The women have all had various terrifying plastic surgeries to turn them into Pixar characters. They do skincare routines that leave their faces always looking slightly wet, like they’re still encased in their protective gel. If you cut into them they’d be skin-coloured and gummy-textured all the way through. The women are all relatively successful in life, business owners, high-powered professionals, but you get the sense that appearing on this show is their last-ditch effort, one final attempt at heterosexuality before they give up entirely. If it doesn’t work out they’ll spend the rest of their lives applying face masks and drinking rosé in their plush velvet Melbourne apartments, e-commerce anchoresses, peaceably alone. A surprising number of them have never had a serious relationship in their lives. Sometimes it’s because they’re obviously deeply mentally unstable, but most of the time it’s because they’re smart, smart enough to see through the attempted manipulations of the leery dullheaded Australian men that are their sexual peers, smart enough to know when someone is trying to drag them into a purgatorial realm of frequent but indifferent sex with no obligations attached, and smart enough to pick an evening with the face mask and the rosé instead. So they go on the show that promises to let them skip past all that bullshit, for the small price of turning themselves into mass entertainment.\nThat’s the women. The men are trickier. Men don’t watch stuff like MAFSA unless prodded into it by their girlfriends, and the one thing all the men on the show have in common is that they don’t have girlfriends. What kind of man ends up on a TV show that’s so fundamentally for women? Actually, there’s a very simple explanation. The men are on the show because they’ve noticed that if you go on there and manage to stick it out for a month or two, you will get one hundred thousand Instagram followers, and then you can spend the rest of your life doing sponsored content and making paid appearances at nightclubs on the Gold Coast. This is the source of the show’s dramatic tension. The producers help where they can, with a few gimmicky exercises to tear their couples apart—most marriages don’t involve the groom having to rank all of his wife’s friends by physical attractiveness—and I’m sure the editors are sneakily recutting everything that happens into a fantasy narrative that barely resembles actual events, but the real load-bearing simulation is performed by the cast themselves. The men have to keep up the impression that they’ve got a profound romantic chemistry with this woman they’ve just met. At the weekly dinner parties, the men brutally police each other for any slips. They’re all primly appalled when any other man seems to be disrespecting his wife. But over time, the mask inevitably slips. Almost all the couples stop having sex within the first few weeks. The women are left to slowly go crazy, trying not to recognise what they’ve secretly known all along: that this man they’ve been sharing a bed with simply does not care if they live or die.\nBut I think what keeps me watching this thing isn’t even so much the marriages at first sight as the Australia. There’s a British version of the show; it’s just not the same. British people are ugly. Our features are all squished together. Even with the plastic surgery we’re not gloriously synthetic like the Australians; we look like bog mutants. Inbred, floppy-lipped, small bitter eyes. The houses we live in are poky and cold. Our economy is contracting. Our skies are grey. Our island is small. Meanwhile Australia is, as far as I can tell, a kind of heaven, all green and lush and prosperous. Incredible that we used to send convicts there. Every so often British people get sick of being miserable and decide to move to Australia, and when you talk to them afterwards they’re almost giddy with it. Do you have any idea how much higher the salaries are here? And what you can get for the price of a mildewing flat in Deptford? And how nice it feels to live in a country that isn’t visibly going to the dogs? Yes, we do go surfing. We go surfing on Christmas. We eat huge thick steaks in our air-conditioned homes, in our golden philistine dreamworld on the opposite side of the planet, where people walk with their feet pointing up and their heads pointing down.\nAustralia hovered in the European imagination long before we ever set foot there. The Greeks and the Romans knew that the earth was round, and they could calculate what portion of the sphere was occupied by the world they knew: there must be something on the other side. A terra australis incognita. Pliny never doubted that it was inhabited. ‘We maintain that there are men dispersed over every part of the earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to tread equally on the middle of the earth. If anyone should ask why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do not fall.’ The Australians are our opposites, sitting under similar skies, making calculations. In the Chorographia of Pomponius Mela, he begins by pointing out that the earth has two inhabitable zones, layered between the two icy poles and the unbearable heat of the torrid equator. ‘The Antichthones inhabit one, we the other. The chorography of the former zone is unknown because of the heat of the intervening expanse, and the chorography of the latter is now to be described.’ He then spends the rest of his book talking about the world he knows, although he does speculate that the Nile might have its source in the other world, on the other side.\nChristianity complicated things. For Christians, humanity has one origin, at Eden. Since Eden is somewhere in the northern hemisphere, and it’s impossible to pass through the deadly heat of the equator, the antipodes must be uninhabited. Augustine has no time for ‘the fable that there are antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, that is on no ground credible.’ Yes, the earth is a sphere, but ‘it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture gives no false information, and it is too absurd to say that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other.’ Thomas Aquinas also rejected the antipodes. In his Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate, he refutes the idea that a just God would not consign unbelievers to Hell when they’d never even heard the Gospel. He does this by simply insisting that everyone in the world has heard the Gospel, even in the furthest pagan lands, and rejected it. Even if someone were ‘brought up in the forest or among wolves,’ God would ‘send some preacher of the faith to him as he sent Peter to Cornelius.’ But since no one from the Christian world can reach the antipodes, God would not have put anyone there at all.\nOne interesting compromise was proposed by the Dominican friar Egbert of Hereford. Australia, he suggests, is a mirror of the known world, except that their sun rises when ours sets. When you go to sleep and dream, another version of yourself is waking up in Australia. His country is brighter than yours, animal symbols and primary colours. When he goes to sleep again you remember his life, just for a moment, and then it evaporates.\nFor centuries, despite the stern theological arguments of Augustine and Aquinas, Terra Australis Incognita continued to appear on maps and globes, pretty much exactly where Australia actually lies. We knew it was there, with a knowledge that drew from sources other than reason. And then, in the seventeeth century, we finally set eyes on the continent we’d been imagining for two millennia. It was real, and it was populated, by maybe the most fascinating people on earth. The Australians had split off from the rest of humanity more than fifty thousand years ago. They had sailed across palaeolithic oceans, long before anyone else had developed any kind of open-water navigation. As far as we know, when they set out humanity had yet to produce any representational art. We had not yet learned to create fire at will. Some of the more sophisticated flint-knapped tools had yet to be invented. But the Australians had boats. Then, once they arrived, they decided to forget all their impossibly advanced technology and never took to the seas again. In the time since then, as the rest of the world churned with constant migrations and population replacements, waves of farmers and pastoralists sweeping across the earth and exterminating each other, the Australians stayed exactly where they were. Across deserts and jungles and dozens of separate language families, they maintained a single pan-continental religious structure held together by the songlines that cross the land from coast to coast. The Australians believed in animal symbols. They believed that the world came out of a dream.\nAnd then, in 1788, a group of people who, just yesterday, were wandering pastoralist herdsmen on the Russian steppes, intruded on that world at Botany Bay. They had come to this sacred place on the underside of the world because they wanted to use it as a prison for petty thieves. Within a millisecond, almost all the Australians were dead, and the Yamnaya herdsmen had built something else over their graves, a sunnier, dumber version of Britain thrown up on an imaginary continent, where they say things like ‘fair suck of the sav’ or ‘I’m not here to fuck spiders,’ and end their sentences with ‘hey,’ and throw prawns on the barbie, and marry each other at first sight.\nSubscribe now\nAnyway, in the most recent season of Married at First Sight Australia we’re introduced to Tommy, 31. Tommy lives in Wollongong, New South Wales, where he works as a surf instructor. He has close-cropped blond hair and Polynesian tattoos all the way up to his jawline, and when he takes off his shirt roughly ten seconds into his introductory segment we can see that he also has a set of perfect, plastic, creatine abs. A silver cross dangles from his earring. People see me and they make all kind of assumptions, he says. But I don’t drink, I’ve never taken drugs, really I’m just a mummy’s boy. Shot of Tommy running out of the surf, whooping like a madman. It feels like modern dating is all about going to clubs, he says, getting pissed every night, I’m not about that. Shot of Tommy in the gym, lifting, then with his arm round another beautifully muscled man who is presumably his friend or maybe just someone the producers brought along.\nOne thing that’s unique about Tommy is that family is so important to him. We visit his mother’s bungalow in Albion Park. She is a very alarming woman to look at, partly because her flesh is lumpy and loose and folded so that she resembles a particularly inbred dog, and partly because she’s dressed like a clown. She’s wearing a diaphanous teal pierrot blouse and her hair in a purple bob. Big splotches of rouge on her cheeks. She seems like a nice person. She’s telling the cameras that her son’s always been the most perfect gentleman but if anything he dotes on her too much, so she hopes he finds a nice girl who might take him off her hands. She cackles. But at this point I’m not listening to her, because in amongst all the piled-up tat that crowds Tommy’s mum’s house I’ve caught a glimpse of something I recognise. I have to rewind and pause on exactly the right frame. It’s an oil painting, in profile, of a thuggish-looking man uncomfortably wrapped in a nineteenth-century suit. I’m sure I’ve seen this man, in relation to something I was reading about. He doesn’t look like a writer. I take a photo of the screen and reverse image search and yes, it is, it’s Jacob Mudie, the failed explorer. It’s the same portrait that illustrates his Wikipedia page. A bit of Googling reveals that yes, Tommy from MAFS is, in fact, the great-great-great-great-grandson of Jacob Mudie on his mother’s side.\nNot many people remember the Mudie Expedition. We like hearing about tragic failures; sometimes we’ll settle for a success; the Mudie Expedition was neither. It is not particularly important in the history of Australia, but it does have a minor place in the history of madness.\nThe story goes that during the first phase of settlement in Australia, the European colonists kept to their fertile strip around the eastern edge of the continent, hemmed in by the Great Dividing Range and the vast dry bush beyond. They had the sea, which connected them to the rest of the world; that was what mattered. But in the 1850s, people started wrapping the world in copper wire. If Australia was going to thrive, it needed to be connected to the global telegraph network, and that would mean stringing a cable all the way across the interior of the continent, from the cities in the southeastern corner to the Top End near what’s now Darwin, and from there on to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the world. The man chosen to plot a route through the wilderness was a furious Scot named Jacob Mudie. Mudie had got his start as a surveyor in the Highlands during the Clearances, mapping out Hebridean crofts on behalf of Sir John Powlett Orde, Second Baronet Orde. There was a potato famine; the people were half-starved. Curious pattern of wounds and broken skin around the fingertips. Mudie’s job was to map the plots these people would shortly be losing, but something else happened while he was there, some incident with a daughter of Clan MacEachen; a limp body left on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Mudie fled to Australia. He mapped out a claim in Djadjawurrung country, which happened to be the only plot of land in Victoria without a speck of gold in it. He continued to range and survey while his wife and two daughters chewed on warrigal greens and bark. Another incident. Some of the Djadjawurrung wandered onto his land to hunt and he laid them out flat on the ground for the Border Police. When the police sought out their camp, the womenfolk were all dead too, slumped over the fire, hair singed. His personal conduct was less than ideal, but Mudie was the man for the job. He could speak a few words of Wemba-Wemba and Barrabool, he could handle himself with the Brown Bess as well as he could a theodolite, and he was willing to walk out into the centre of Australia in return for a share in the telegraph company. In September 1857 he departed from Melbourne with six Irish porters and a train of donkeys, off into the interior.\nHe did not return in 1858, which is when he was expected. He also did not return in 1859. In 1860, the Royal Society of Victoria commissioned the much more extensive Burke and Wills Expedition, which set out with nineteen men, twenty-three horses, twenty-six camels driven by Pashtun camel-drivers shipped over from the fringes of British India, and two years’ worth of food. In 1861, three colonies sent out rescue expeditions to search for Burke and Wills, and ended up finding their bones. In 1862, five years after he set out, Jacob Mudie returned to Melbourne. Naked and sun-scorched, lines of livid red cracking open his back, lips black and gummy, nose shrivelled, mucous lining black, conjunctiva black, feet bursting with open sores. He was raving.\nHe had not reached the other shore; the Irish porters had all died and so had the donkeys, but he had walked across the desert to the dead centre of Australia, and in that centre he had found an inland sea. He’d even mapped it. But what really mattered wasn’t the sea. He had learned something in the outback. It had been revealed to him that as soon as Captain Cook had come ashore at Botany Bay, he said, he had fallen asleep and dreamed that he was walking around, surveying hills and harbours. And when the First Fleet arrived they had also fallen asleep, on the ground where they landed, under the open sky, dreaming that they were founding a colony. Then the Second Fleet came to sleep right next to them. From the start of the Gold Rush, boatloads of immigrants had been arriving in Port Phillip, all of them pouring out onto the soft green ground, and immediately collapsing into a deep, deep, motionless sleep. This city, Mudie said, is a dream, it’s a desert mirage, all Australia is a dream, we have trespassed on our dreamworld, and the only thing any white or Chinaman can do here is sleep! Mudie was confined in the Yarra Bend Asylum for Idiots and Imbeciles. He took few visitors. Sometimes his wife would try to see him, and he would point in her face, all scornful, and say: Asleep. He died in 1882.\nThe map he produced, of the inland sea at the heart of Australia, is still in the archives of the Melbourne Museum. It’s drawn with precision. Calculations pencilled in the fringes. The coastline of his inland sea is rugged, fjorded; it follows the exact contours of the west coast of Scotland.\nJacob Mudie’s great-great-great-great-grandson is about to be married at first sight to Alyssa, 28, from Sydney. Alyssa is plastic, attractive, bottle-blonde, urn-shaped face, subtle fillers, mesomorph. She was born in Egypt but came to Australia when she was a baby. She works in market research, and the gimmick for her introductory segment is that it’s framed like she’s doing market research for herself as a romantic partner, but even though she has so much love to give no one wants a loyal woman with old-fashioned values any more. She has never had a serious long-term relationship in her life. She wants to be in love. One thing that’s unique about Alyssa is that family is so important to her. We see her phoning up her dad to tell him the good news. I’m getting married, she squeals. Her father is delighted. He wants to know everything. Who is the man? Where’s he from? Is he Coptic? How did they meet? Is he Coptic? Does he go to church? Is he Coptic? Well, says Alyssa, I haven’t actually met him yet. I’m going on MAFS. Mafs, says her dad, what is mafs? She tells him. There’s a long pause. No, he says. No, no, no, no, no.\nAlyssa and Tommy are married in a little wooded dell overlooking Sydney Harbour. There’s a wedding arch made from fake white roses. Tommy breaks into a big grin when he sees her walking up the aisle. Wow, he says, you’re stunning, hey? Later the producers interview her under some eucalypts. He’s toooo handsome, she complains, like I’m just standing here like, how am I going to mess this up? I’m really freaking out now! You should have given me someone less handsome to take the pressure off! But later at the reception she suddenly breaks into tears. Two friends have come to her wedding, but all of her family have boycotted the event. This is my wedding, she keeps saying. I spent my whole childhood dreaming of this day. I never ever imagined my family wouldn’t be here. Tommy tries to comfort her. I’m sorta your family now, hey? he says, and puts an arm over her shoulder. She screams and flicks his hand off of her like it’s an enormous spider, and sinks back into her tears. They do not have sex on their wedding night.\nFor their honeymoon, the pair are sent to a wellness retreat in the desert outside Alice Springs, right in the centre of Australia. Stone Buddha heads, gravel raked into a yin and yang. We see them lying in shivasana, but Tommy keeps poking Alyssa in the shoulder while she tries not to laugh. They go for a dip in Ellery Creek and Tommy shrieks at the cold. Ooh, my little fella’s curled right up! he says. Later we see them over dinner. The musical score mocks Tommy as he insists on saying grace over their pad ka prow. Lord, he says, thank you for this food you have given us from your bounty, and thank you for bringing me my beautiful wife Alyssa, so we can honour your commandments… Alyssa side-eyes the camera. Cut to Alyssa, talking head. I mean, I’m Christian, she says. But Tommy’s like, Christian Christian. Back to the table. Can we eat now? says Alyssa. But Tommy’s still going. He’s asking God to look after his mother while he’s away in the NT. And then he asks God to check in on Alyssa’s parents too, and prays that He’ll remove the scales from their eyes so they’ll accept him as their son-in-law. He thinks he’s just delivered a coup. Alyssa smiles, weakly. Cut to talking head. That is honestly just so, so disrespectful, she says. Don’t talk about my family, ok? Don’t talk about them to your mates, don’t talk about them to your mum, and don’t you dare talk about my family to God. They do not have sex on the first night of their honeymoon.\nOn the second day they go for a hike out in the desert. Creepy jagged rock formations peering over the spinifex plains. Ghost gums twisting spindly between the sun-blackened stones. Tommy’s wearing a cork hat. He thinks it’s hilarious. He keeps making little jokes to Alyssa and she barely responds. You know what, he says suddenly, [bleep] this. I tried, alright? I really tried. He suddenly starts marching away from her. Intensely dramatic music, epic fantasy battle music. Cut to steadicam footage as one of the cameramen tries to follow him. Just [bleep] off, Tommy says, and breaks into a run. He’s very fit. Cut to night. Alyssa’s back at the resort. She’s crying. I scared him off, she said, this is what I always do, I drive people away. Meanwhile helicopters are in the air, searchlights on, looking for Tommy in endless miles of empty outback. Somewhere out there, Tommy is falling into the infinite centre of everything. They do not have sex on the second night of their honeymoon.\nHe returns the next day. I just needed time to clear my head, he tells the camera. He says that while he was gone he gained the clarity he needed, and now he’s ready to really commit to his relationship with Alyssa. But he seems different; there’s a new interior distance in him. Something as endless as the desert seems to stare out through his eyes. The camera follows Tommy as he bounds up to the suite and knocks on the door. Alyssa opens. Pale without her makeup. She doesn’t seem surprised to see him. You came back, she said. Yeah, says Tommy. He grabs a beer out the minibar and sits down heavily on the sofa. A small cloud of dust rises off his body. Alyssa doesn’t say anything. That night, Tommy and Alyssa have sex for the first time.\nThey move into a sleek, velvet, neutral-toned apartment in Sydney. Now it’s been consummated, Alyssa seems incredibly enthusiastic about their marriage. She keeps calling him hubby, hubbo, sometimes hubbs. He’s speaking less and less. The first argument happens while they’re still unpacking. Alyssa picks up their wedding photo and says she wants to put it by her bedside. Tommy is folding tshirts while staring straight ahead. His eyes seem to be tunnelling down into his skull. Sure, he says. This makes Alyssa upset, because she thinks he ought to want to put the photo on his bedside. I keep giving you these opportunities to show up for me, she says, to let me know you care about me, and all you do is go uh, yeah, sure. Different people show up in different ways, says Tommy. But I’m asking you to show up for me in the way I need you to show up for me, says Alyssa. Yeah, well I’m not a mind reader, hey? says Tommy. You don’t need to be a mind reader, says Alyssa, you just need to stop deflecting and let me feel heard, and if I feel heard then you’ll know how to show up for me! Right, says Tommy, so how do you want me to show up for you? I want, says Alyssa. She takes a few deep breaths. I want you to show up for me, she says, by making space for my feelings when I need to feel heard. Tommy tries to hug her and she bats him in the head with a flip-flop.\nAt the first dinner party Tommy wears an oversized white suit jacket with blue chinos and a blue string vest. Alyssa is loosely wrapped in a kind of large lime-green taffeta ribbon. During the dinner, Craig starts laying into Tommy. You’ve got a beautiful, stunning woman there, he says, but I can tell she’s not being shown up for. Tommy and Alyssa are one of the two major dramas of the evening; the other is that Craig was caught texting his ex during his own honeymoon in Fiji. But now the spotlight’s on Tommy, Craig is making a meal of it. I can’t imagine walking out on this gorgeous, beautiful woman, literally walking out on her into the desert, he says. That’s not how a man shows up. Clara, Craig’s sharp-nosed wife, sits next to him wearing a look of undisguised rage as he keeps piling compliments on Alyssa. But Tommy isn’t there. He’s walking naked along the Bulloo Creek, with six dead Irishmen slung over the backs of the donkeys that plod after him. He’s learned that the desert has a voice, just not one you can detect with your ears. It teaches you things and then you know them, in the same way that there are things you simply come to know in a dream. The desert told him to take off his clothes. You can not be one with the desert while you still wear your clothes. And once you obey, the desert will be kind to you. It has shown him food. Tommy is gnawing on a thighbone of Irishman and marching naked up the Bulloo Creek to meet his destiny.\nAlyssa has a difficult time at the commitment ceremony. Beforehand she’s talking to the cameras about how she’s going to air all her grievances about the way Tommy’s been mistreating her, but before it’s her turn Clara starts accusing Alyssa of trying to tempt Craig away from her, which means Alyssa now has to pretend that everything’s actually going great between her and Tommy, make a show of being all loved up in her new relationship, but the other couples aren’t buying it. Oh babe, says Joanee, he literally abandoned you in the desert, if my husband did that I’d never forgive him. Alyssa laughs, throwing her hair back, like it’s no big deal. We had some problems, yeah, she says. But when he came back he really committed to me, he’s really shown that, I feel like we’re in such a good place right now. Tommy sits staring at nothing. He’s in the flaking eczema scrublands north of Kati Thanda, where salt hollows scar the land under a world-devouring sun. Tommy, says one of the experts, do you think you’re in a good place right now? Yes, says Tommy. The desert is a mirror. I’m in a good place, he says.\nAusten says she thinks Alyssa is being gaslit. I don’t feel like I’m being gaslit, says Alyssa. No but you are, says Austen, he’s gaslighting you so much you don’t even realise you’re being gaslit. I really don’t think that’s true, says Alyssa. Yeah, says Austen, but babe that’s not what you actually think, it’s what he’s making you think, he’s literally putting those thoughts inside your head.\nAfterwards Tommy and Alyssa have to reveal the cards on which they’ve written whether they want to stay with each other, and on the show, or quit. Alyssa has written STAY. She’s drawn a little heart next to it. I’ve sacrificed so much to be here, she says, and I want to prove that it’s possible for anyone of any background to take that step, to be brave and put yourself out there, so I’m staying. Next Tommy shows his card to the camera. It says SLEEP. You’ve written sleep, says the expert. Can you tell me what you meant by that? Alyssa’s inched away from him on the sofa. Why did you write that? she says. What does it mean? What does it mean? Tommy’s face is motionless. We’re asleep, he says. He’s looking straight at the camera. There’s a mineral glint in his eyes.\nEverywhere in the world except Australia, reality comes out of some conscious act of creation. Yahweh Elohim sits in his throne of storm-clouds and decrees: Let there be light. In Australia, there’s the Dreaming. A lustrous, hazy, eternal present lying just beneath the surface of every individual moment, where the ancestral spirits wander the formless land and give it shape. This gorge is a footprint being left by Emu in the Emu Dreaming. This waterhole is where he digs. Here Emu is wounded by Eagle and he thrashes around in the dirt, and that creates Kati Thanda. You can track Emu’s path across the country, see where it intersects with the Eagle Dreaming, the the Dingo Dreaming, the Porcupine Dreaming, the Kangaroo Dreaming. These mountains are Emu where he finally lays down and dies, but there’s a dark cloud in the Milky Way that is also Emu, pacing between the stars. Every time is the dream time. Tommy is also in a dream, walking across the land and giving it shape. The thin stark telegraph line will lacerate the earth wherever he sets his foot. New electronic songlines unspool behind him. He is walking the Telegraph Dreaming. The Information Dreaming. The Communications Dreaming. The Reality TV Dreaming.\nSince Alyssa has decided to stay, the couple have one more week on the show to try to work things out. This week is Intimacy Week. Alyssa is having an intimacy workshop with the other girls. The other girls are all very slightly frosty to her; they’ve decided she’s complicit in her own gaslighting. Meanwhile Alyssa keeps giggling at the sex toys. I don’t think I’m, like, fully comfortable with my sexual side yet, she tells the camera. One of the experts reminds her that intimacy is not the same as sex. It’s about two people learning to be present and comfortable and vulnerable with one another. For her task, she has to sit facing Tommy, holding hands with him, gazing into his eyes, and ask him four prepared questions about himself. What do you like about me? What makes you nervous? Were you happy as a child? When was the last time you cried, and why? Tommy considers these. What do I like about you, he says. Well first of all you’ve got a stunning body, that’s number one. Number two, I think you’ve got really great values, like family’s so important to you. Number three… His jaw rotates soundlessly for a moment. Cut to Alyssa’s impatient face, waiting. What makes me nervous, Tommy says. Flying, he says. I always get heaps scared when I’m on a flight. Cut to desaturated footage of Tommy on his honeymoon flight to Alice Springs, chattering happily away. Alyssa is looking furious. Did I have a happy childhood, says Tommy. Flashes of a crofter’s hovel in the boglands. A happy childhood, he manages again. He is being whipped across the knuckles with a length of heather rope, until all the skin has shredded away. Suddenly a wet howl bursts out of Tommy’s mouth. Alyssa swoops in to cradle his head. It’s ok, she says as he cries hot tears into her dress, you’re safe, I’ve got you, you can tell me when you’re ready.\nI feel like we made a really big breakthrough today, she tells the camera later.\nThat night Tommy has sex with his wife again. His haunches move like a piston, well-oiled, engineered, and she lies face-down on the bed going unf, unf, unf. He is pushing into the red centre of her body, deeper, deeper, in. The wet polymorphous worldbearing womb. Tommy has walked all the way into the heart of the desert but as far as he walks the centre he’s after keeps trailing away from him. He ate his porters and he ate the donkeys, even after the meat went rancid. Some of the mobs have fed him and some of the mobs he shot. He smears one hand all over Alyssa’s face. Grinding hard into the cleft of her arse. Deeper and deeper into the guts of Australia until finally the fundament opens and where there had been one parched and endless desert he’s now standing naked on a hillside above a slate-grey island-speckled sea.\nIt’s different here, on the secret sea. Around Tommy’s feet the spinifex fades to gorse, yellower maybe, but it’s the yellow of old film, colours bleeding dimmer. Yellow of lichen, old newspapers, discoloured teeth. A few purple heath flowers below the cliffs by the sea. There are two black figures down there, naked aboriginals, a man and a woman, hand in hand, picking their way with some difficulty over the cold and slimy rocks. He is aware that their names are Man and Woman. Eventually Man stops his clambering and just steadies himself with his spear, watching Woman as she struggles on ahead. Once there’s a bit of distance between them he balances the spear in his woomera and flings it. The spear falls like a raindrop, right through Woman’s body. She lies on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Tommy is erect. He walks down to the shore, which is sandy now, a big broad beach under sandy cliffs with bungalows on top. Sandon Point, Wollongong. Waves look ace. He kneels over the dying Woman and plugs up her wound. He understands it all. It’s still the show; he’s dreaming about the show. They say the whole world came out of a dream. That makes perfect sense. Everyone knows what dreams, once you strip away the metaphors, are really all about.\nAnyway, at the start of the next episode, they showed a few brief shots of Tommy and Alyssa’s empty apartment while the narrator explained that Tommy had to be hospitalised after a medical emergency and would not be returning to the show. According to the Daily Mail, Tommy is currently in an acute psychiatric unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Alyssa spent two nights in a trauma ward at the same hospital before being discharged. According to the Mail, she has chosen not to press charges. It was a very sudden end to one of the more promisingly dysfunctional couples on the show, but to be honest I was glad not to have to see them any more. There was something worrying about Tommy and Alyssa, and it wasn’t just Tommy’s increasingly odd behaviour. Like I said at the start, it made me enjoy the show a lot less. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I think it had to do with the way they were presented; my whole viewing experience felt different when I was watching them. For instance, there was one part near the end where I definitely remember seeing Tommy and Alyssa having sex. All the lights were on in their plush millennial-grey bedroom, this really cold white light, almost institutional, and I could see Alyssa’s red cheeks and the red circles on her slapped arse and Tommy’s stubbly thighs pumping back and forth, all looking grimly desaturated in that light, totally unerotic, like so many piles of sausages. There wasn’t any narration. There wasn’t any music. It lasted for a really long time. I guess it was a kind of glimpse into the reality behind reality TV, without any of the usual manipulative editing or the musical cues that sustain the narrative fantasy and tell you how to feel about it. Except I find it hard to believe that Tommy and Alyssa would have allowed the cameras in there with them, or that a long stark sequence of Tommy emotionlessly fucking Alyssa doggy style would have been cleared for broadcast. To be honest, while I can remember that sequence I don’t remember watching it on a screen. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t on my sofa in London when it happened. I wasn’t watching TV. I wasn’t grounded in anything physical at all. Where was my girlfriend? The person who got me into this show in the fist place? My own dreamy heterosexual idyll? Dissipated. Sunk back into the sea that birthed her. And this actually happened quite a lot, whenever Tommy was onscreen: I’d find myself disembodied, watching, knowing certain things about where he was or what he was thinking, even when those things didn’t really make sense. So in a way I was glad when it was over, even though it’s obviously awful that Alyssa had to go to hospital. Afterwards the episode continued pretty seamlessly. Justin and Joanee are on the rocks after Joanee accuses Justin of disrespecting her sister. Chardonnay admits she’s been flirting with one of the other grooms. Shots of traffic moving over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Skyscrapers and eucalyptus trees. The sun’s always shining over there. Eventually I grew tired. I went to sleep, and dreamed about Australia.\n\n\n\n\nIn dreams, walk with me",

If you know anything at all about how humans have traditionally structured our world, you&#8217;ll know that this is bullshit. The left-right divide is older than the French Revolution, and also older than the monarchies of Europe. It stretches deep into our prehistory. It might be older than the human species.</p><p>Things that resemble the left-right spectrum do seem to show up a lot, in strange corners of the world. The people of the southwestern United States have traditionally organised the universe along the four cardinal directions. So, for instance, among the Zuni, the west is associated with the colour blue, the bear, the coyote, redtop grass, the clans named after those totems, priesthood, archery, and water. The north has yellow, the pelican, the grouse, the oak, their clans, the cactus band, warfare, and air. Other people have a similar system, but populate it differently. For the Ojibwe, the west is black and associated with buffalo, deer, and death. For the Navajo, west is yellow, feminine, and abalone shell. You can see traces of the same thing even when directions aren&#8217;t involved: In Australia, the Wakelbura divide the entire phenomenal and mystical world between two moieties, Wutaru and Mullera. The sun is Wutaru, the moon is Mullera. Emu and bandicoot are Wutaru, dog and kangaroo are Mullera. Honey might be either Wutaru or Mullera, depending on which type of bee produced it. When a member of a Wutaru clan dies, his body must be exposed on a platform made from the wood of a Wutaru tree. </p><p>This stuff is not restricted to primitive societies. Medieval chronicles referred to the coast of Dalmatia as &#8216;Red Croatia,&#8217; because in the Slavic cardinal system the south is red; the original homeland of the Croats was &#8216;White Croatia,&#8217; somewhere near the Carpathian mountains. In the twentieth century, there was a region of Outer Manchuria, up against the fringes of Korea, that had been settled by people from the opposite end of the Russian Empire; they called it Green Ukraine. East is green. And the Australian system should not be unfamiliar to anyone who&#8217;s encountered a Romance language. In French, a book, an arm, and a coat are all masculine, while a page, a leg, and a jacket are feminine. Spanish distinguishes between a masculine knife, <em>el cuchillo</em>, and a feminine spoon, <em>la cuchara</em>. Here is the trap left for the slightly smart. Knife: violent, penetrating, penis, man. Spoon: receptive, containing, vagina, woman. Completely wrong. The masculine objects do not belong to men and the feminine objects do not belong to women; the universe is cleaved by a division as cosmic as the one between Wutaru and Mullera. Biological sex is just one minor feature of grammatical gender; men are just another object, like books, arms, and coats, that belong to one side of the invisible line that organises the world.</p><p>It&#8217;s the same with left and right. The actual directions are just an echo. The political division came first.</p><p>Look at left and right handedness, which are already a metaphor. The right: dumb, majoritarian, conformist, constantly confusing itself for nature. The left: a pesky and persecuted minority, always trying to invert the settled way of doing things, and usually making things difficult for everyone else. Jesus separates the sheep (obedient, herdlike) to his right from the goats (wilful, questioning) to his left. Later he ascends to Heaven, to sit by the right hand of God. In Tantric traditions, the more orthodox sects are <em>dakshinachara</em>, or right-handed. They emphasise balance, serenity, and austerity. But there&#8217;s another path to the godhead, which seeks out the universal mind through chaos, delirium, drunkenness, and sex; this is the <em>vamachara</em>, or left-hand path. Yang is on the right. Yin is on the left. This stuff has been woven into the way we move through the world for a very long time. When a band of chimpanzees moves in formation across the forest floor, alpha out front, notice which side his most senior lieutenant takes. In 1789, the monarchists would never have agreed to sit on the left side of the Constituent Assembly, because they were <em>already on the right</em>.</p><p>Still, every few months, someone emerges to declare that the left-right model of politics is obsolete and we need to scrap it for something else. A popular replacement is the division between inside and outside: inside you have the neoliberal consensus and its armies of smug, credentialed ideological clones; outside, the teeming horde of unvaccinated maniacs. Repeated attempts to build some kind of left-right populist coalition of the outside. The problem, though, is that as soon as representatives of the outside gain any kind of political power, they become, to some degree at least, insiders, which means that instead of a neat circle you have to plot your politics on one of those four-dimensional cubes that&#8217;s continually folding in on itself. Another model is the one based on speed: there&#8217;s an accelerationist politics that wants to propel us forwards into fully automated gay space communism or the AI crypto hustle thunderdome, and a regressive politics that wants to pull the emergency brake of history or retvrn to some plague-ridden late medieval idyll. Obviously I&#8217;m very interested in the idea that politics is ultimately a question of <em>controlling the flow of time</em>, but since time has continued to move at exactly one second per second regardless of who&#8217;s in power, it doesn&#8217;t feel like a particularly useful model. Thomas Friedman once tried to divide the world into &#8216;web people&#8217; and &#8216;wall people.&#8217; This is pleasingly insane. We could try out some others. A political spectrum split between the Party of the Sun (Leninists, reactionaries) and the Party of the Moon (liberals, anarchists). Maybe in the background there&#8217;s the unimaginable politics of the stars. Or we could divide the world between birdism, migratory, globalist, and beastism, rooted, wallowing. It&#8217;s fun. But if you want to actually understand reality, I still think the old left-right model is the only one that makes sense. As I&#8217;ve written before, politics is only really meaningful if it can be plotted on that axis. Dig into anything that claims to be entirely off the map, and you&#8217;ll usually find there&#8217;s nothing but fascism and styrofoam inside. There will always be a right. There will always be a left.</p><p>But even I can admit that lately, things have been getting weird. </p><p>These terms are differential; they only have meaning relative to each other. The actual content is indeterminate. Most of the time left is the opposite of right, and vice versa. But every so often, we go through a period of crisis, in which all our politics go gooey and swirl together like an insect in a chrysalis. What comes out afterwards is usually, in terms of the previous setup, a contradiction in terms. Last time it happened, we ended up with conservatives trying to radically reshape all of human society according to their utopian vision, while the left were reduced to sitting around getting misty-eyed about the good old days of postwar social democracy. Another mutation appears to be happening now. Entire ideologies are going extinct. New ones sprouting, soft and pale, like mushrooms on a fallen tree. What emerges afterwards will still be a left and a right, but they won&#8217;t look anything like the left and the right you know. They&#8217;ll look like this:</p><h4>Left: Elite human capitalism</h4><p>There is going to be a woke 2. I&#8217;m not good at much, but I am usually ahead of the curve on the precise trajectory of wokeness. Already in 2021 I was writing that &#8216;the ideological frenzy of the last few years is starting to die down. People are quietly, guiltily removing the pronouns from their email signatures. Last Thanksgiving, there were slightly fewer articles about how to hold your uncle personally accountable for three hundred years of American racism.&#8217; About a year later, I was the first person to write about the phenomenon entirely in the past tense. Now, everyone else has caught up, which means that somewhere, woke 2 is already gestating, in one of the hidden wombs of the world. For a while, I thought we still had an opportunity. If woke 2 is inevitable, maybe a few ideological entrepreneurs can get in on the ground floor and point it in a less obnoxious direction than the last version. You can have a lot of leverage when you&#8217;re early. But I think it&#8217;s already too late. The next iteration is already half-formed, and it is a wet unborn monster, worse than anything we could have imagined.</p><p>If we are about to see the emergence of woke 2, it&#8217;s because woke 1 fulfilled an important ideological need, which is now going unmet. It&#8217;s boring to keep harping on about the nature of wokeness in 2025, so I&#8217;ll be brief: its function was to justify the position of the ruling classes in a way that doesn&#8217;t acknowledge the actual substance of that position, which is the property relation. In place of the exploitation that undergirds the world, it presented a vast mishmash of various forms of prejudice, hatred, and exclusion, which could be embodied in entirely ordinary words, hand gestures, or sometimes large and inert rocks. (In 2021, a racist boulder was removed from the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.) It is not easy to be a good person, it takes a level of scrupulous ritual observance usually only found among ultra-orthodox Jews. But as it turns out, the most conscientious and sensitive people are in the ruling classes. They are <em>more egalitarian than everyone else</em>. This is how companies that make machines for scooping out the eyes of African war orphans ended up lecturing their workers on how to be less oppressive.</p><p>It was all very clever. Unfortunately, it turned out that people respond very, very badly to this kind of moral condescension. The backlash has been so intense that it&#8217;s now socially acceptable to espouse outright skull-measuring scientific racism in public. If our object is to build a more egalitarian society, woke 1 was an incredible failure. But that was never the point. Which is why woke 2 will be the dialectical synthesis of the smug hectoring of wokeness and the skull-measuring scientific racism that replaced it.</p><p>For most of the last century, progressivism has implied at least some kind of vague rhetorical commitment to egalitarianism. But there&#8217;s no <em>necessary</em> reason why the two should always go together. In the nineteenth century, nothing was more progressive than eugenics. In Dostoevsky&#8217;s <em>Demons</em>, Shigalyov can imagine a liberated, scientific, progressive future in which ninety percent of humanity is reduced to total slavery, and not see any contradiction. Rather than continue going through the rigmarole of inventing egalitarian alibis for a fundamentally unequal society, the mainstream centre-left might just find another myth. Currently, the ideologies of explicit hierarchy are mostly found on the right, but there&#8217;s nothing keeping them there. We are in a gooey age, where all boundaries disappear. </p><p>Maybe the greatest ideological entrepreneur of our era is Richard Hanania. Far more than any of his competitors&#8212;Curtis Yarvin, Bronze Age Pervert, me&#8212;he seems to prefigure the politics of the future. Hanania is a columnist and the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, which is something he made up with his friend Eric. His ideological trajectory has gone something like this. Fifteen years ago, Hanania was an outright white racist, writing sentences like &#8216;White nationalism is the only hope that part of what made the American nation great will survive somewhere.&#8217; He believed that white people form a distinct genetic unit with particular qualities, such as IQ, that make them, on average, intrinsically better than other people. (Hanania is Palestinian. According to the US Census Bureau, this makes him white. Historically, others have disagreed. There might be more than one reason he wrote all this stuff under a pseudonym.) Later, he moved into the more mainstream right-wing media, publishing various forms of anti-woke blather, some of which has informed the policies of the current Trump administration, without much to indicate that any of his underlying beliefs had changed. But slowly he started to notice something. He believed that white people were smarter and more capable than everyone else, but most of the smart and successful <em>individuals</em> seemed to believe in some kind of liberal anti-racism, whereas most of the people who agreed with <em>him</em> seemed to have small pools of custard in their brains. </p><p>In the last few years, Hanania has made a kind of aretaic turn. Instead of the white race, he now believes in a universal herrenvolk stratum of &#8216;elite human capital.&#8217; He now supports gay marriage and trans rights, because gay and trans people tend to be wealthier, more liberal, and higher IQ, and because openness to sexual minorities seems to be a trait of elite human capital. He supports abortion, and quotes Jessica Valenti while doing so. He opposes Trump and the MAGA movement, because they&#8217;re all plainly morons. He no longer opposes mass immigration, because it provides a wider talent pool from which elite human capital might be drawn, even if it&#8217;s statistically likelier to come from some groups than others. He likes Jews. He has rearranged his Hitler particles into an almost perfect facsimile of liberalism, with just one piece missing, which is the assumption of a universal human dignity. Perhaps relatedly, he also believes that he, as an instance of elite human capital, could easily write a Jacobean tragedy as good as any of Shakespeare&#8217;s, if he had a few days to learn all the old-timey words. </p><p>I hate to say it, but I think this thing might have legs. The centre-left is hollowed out, it&#8217;s empty, its current best idea for 2028 is just running Kamala Harris again in the hope that things go differently. That space is there to be filled, and what makes elite human capitalism potent is that it doesn&#8217;t just flatter the position of the ruling classes&#8212;they have plenty of options on that front&#8212;but also provides the materials for an entirely new round of shrieking moral priggishness. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine a future in which your HR department will force you into annual trainings on your moral duty to build and develop your human capital. You are not a soul, or an ends in yourself; you are an instrument. Be the best instrument you can be! Celebrities drummed out of public life for displaying low-human capital traits. Listening to music without headphones on public transport. Drunk driving. Don&#8217;t you know the <em>harm</em> that causes? Do better! Be better! Maybe in a few years you&#8217;ll accidentally use a non-EHC word in conversation and everyone around you will start grimacing. A muscular, technocratic, progressive, elitist, and utterly philistine left. It really could work. But not for Hanania himself. After all, he used to be an outright white supremacist, and what could be less EHC than <em>that</em>? Our present might be able to forgive him. His future will not.</p><h4>Centre: Urothumocracy</h4>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/ideologies-of-the-near-future\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

Last time it happened, we ended up with conservatives trying to radically reshape all of human society according to their utopian vision, while the left were reduced to sitting around getting misty-eyed about the good old days of postwar social democracy. Another mutation appears to be happening now. Entire ideologies are going extinct. New ones sprouting, soft and pale, like mushrooms on a fallen tree. What emerges afterwards will still be a left and a right, but they won’t look anything like the left and the right you know. They’ll look like this:\nLeft: Elite human capitalism\nThere is going to be a woke 2. I’m not good at much, but I am usually ahead of the curve on the precise trajectory of wokeness. Already in 2021 I was writing that ‘the ideological frenzy of the last few years is starting to die down. People are quietly, guiltily removing the pronouns from their email signatures. Last Thanksgiving, there were slightly fewer articles about how to hold your uncle personally accountable for three hundred years of American racism.’ About a year later, I was the first person to write about the phenomenon entirely in the past tense. Now, everyone else has caught up, which means that somewhere, woke 2 is already gestating, in one of the hidden wombs of the world. For a while, I thought we still had an opportunity. If woke 2 is inevitable, maybe a few ideological entrepreneurs can get in on the ground floor and point it in a less obnoxious direction than the last version. You can have a lot of leverage when you’re early. But I think it’s already too late. The next iteration is already half-formed, and it is a wet unborn monster, worse than anything we could have imagined.\nIf we are about to see the emergence of woke 2, it’s because woke 1 fulfilled an important ideological need, which is now going unmet. It’s boring to keep harping on about the nature of wokeness in 2025, so I’ll be brief: its function was to justify the position of the ruling classes in a way that doesn’t acknowledge the actual substance of that position, which is the property relation. In place of the exploitation that undergirds the world, it presented a vast mishmash of various forms of prejudice, hatred, and exclusion, which could be embodied in entirely ordinary words, hand gestures, or sometimes large and inert rocks. (In 2021, a racist boulder was removed from the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.) It is not easy to be a good person, it takes a level of scrupulous ritual observance usually only found among ultra-orthodox Jews. But as it turns out, the most conscientious and sensitive people are in the ruling classes. They are more egalitarian than everyone else. This is how companies that make machines for scooping out the eyes of African war orphans ended up lecturing their workers on how to be less oppressive.\nIt was all very clever. Unfortunately, it turned out that people respond very, very badly to this kind of moral condescension. The backlash has been so intense that it’s now socially acceptable to espouse outright skull-measuring scientific racism in public. If our object is to build a more egalitarian society, woke 1 was an incredible failure. But that was never the point. Which is why woke 2 will be the dialectical synthesis of the smug hectoring of wokeness and the skull-measuring scientific racism that replaced it.\nFor most of the last century, progressivism has implied at least some kind of vague rhetorical commitment to egalitarianism. But there’s no necessary reason why the two should always go together. In the nineteenth century, nothing was more progressive than eugenics. In Dostoevsky’s Demons, Shigalyov can imagine a liberated, scientific, progressive future in which ninety percent of humanity is reduced to total slavery, and not see any contradiction. Rather than continue going through the rigmarole of inventing egalitarian alibis for a fundamentally unequal society, the mainstream centre-left might just find another myth. Currently, the ideologies of explicit hierarchy are mostly found on the right, but there’s nothing keeping them there. We are in a gooey age, where all boundaries disappear.\nMaybe the greatest ideological entrepreneur of our era is Richard Hanania. Far more than any of his competitors—Curtis Yarvin, Bronze Age Pervert, me—he seems to prefigure the politics of the future. Hanania is a columnist and the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, which is something he made up with his friend Eric. His ideological trajectory has gone something like this. Fifteen years ago, Hanania was an outright white racist, writing sentences like ‘White nationalism is the only hope that part of what made the American nation great will survive somewhere.’ He believed that white people form a distinct genetic unit with particular qualities, such as IQ, that make them, on average, intrinsically better than other people. (Hanania is Palestinian. According to the US Census Bureau, this makes him white. Historically, others have disagreed. There might be more than one reason he wrote all this stuff under a pseudonym.) Later, he moved into the more mainstream right-wing media, publishing various forms of anti-woke blather, some of which has informed the policies of the current Trump administration, without much to indicate that any of his underlying beliefs had changed. But slowly he started to notice something. He believed that white people were smarter and more capable than everyone else, but most of the smart and successful individuals seemed to believe in some kind of liberal anti-racism, whereas most of the people who agreed with him seemed to have small pools of custard in their brains.\nIn the last few years, Hanania has made a kind of aretaic turn. Instead of the white race, he now believes in a universal herrenvolk stratum of ‘elite human capital.’ He now supports gay marriage and trans rights, because gay and trans people tend to be wealthier, more liberal, and higher IQ, and because openness to sexual minorities seems to be a trait of elite human capital. He supports abortion, and quotes Jessica Valenti while doing so. He opposes Trump and the MAGA movement, because they’re all plainly morons. He no longer opposes mass immigration, because it provides a wider talent pool from which elite human capital might be drawn, even if it’s statistically likelier to come from some groups than others. He likes Jews. He has rearranged his Hitler particles into an almost perfect facsimile of liberalism, with just one piece missing, which is the assumption of a universal human dignity. Perhaps relatedly, he also believes that he, as an instance of elite human capital, could easily write a Jacobean tragedy as good as any of Shakespeare’s, if he had a few days to learn all the old-timey words.\nI hate to say it, but I think this thing might have legs. The centre-left is hollowed out, it’s empty, its current best idea for 2028 is just running Kamala Harris again in the hope that things go differently. That space is there to be filled, and what makes elite human capitalism potent is that it doesn’t just flatter the position of the ruling classes—they have plenty of options on that front—but also provides the materials for an entirely new round of shrieking moral priggishness. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which your HR department will force you into annual trainings on your moral duty to build and develop your human capital. You are not a soul, or an ends in yourself; you are an instrument. Be the best instrument you can be! Celebrities drummed out of public life for displaying low-human capital traits. Listening to music without headphones on public transport. Drunk driving. Don’t you know the harm that causes? Do better! Be better! Maybe in a few years you’ll accidentally use a non-EHC word in conversation and everyone around you will start grimacing. A muscular, technocratic, progressive, elitist, and utterly philistine left. It really could work. But not for Hanania himself. After all, he used to be an outright white supremacist, and what could be less EHC than that? Our present might be able to forgive him. His future will not.\nCentre: Urothumocracy\nRead more",

You&#8217;re meeting her at the soda fountain. You&#8217;re meeting her at the ice cream parlour. You&#8217;re meeting her at the drugstore to share a malted milk. You&#8217;ve been going steady with your main squeeze and now you&#8217;re meeting her at the folksy chrome-and-cream diner on Main Street in your quiet walkable 98% white small American town. It&#8217;s always a bright cloudless day. You&#8217;re always meeting her for breakfast. Sometimes, it&#8217;s true, you&#8217;re driving past white tidy houses with American flags waving out front and a dignified speckling of rich amber leaves in the corners of the lawn. Sometimes you&#8217;re rowing across the mirror stillness of an unfamiliar lake. But most of the time you&#8217;re on a chaste breakfast date with your beautiful submissive girlfriend, on an endless succession of bright cloudless days that fill the world with a golden and slightly hazy light even though you can never find the sun.</p><p>You think you&#8217;re going to get the ham and eggs. You tell her that. I think I&#8217;m going to get the ham and eggs, you say.</p><p>That&#8217;s a great choice! your beautiful submissive girlfriend says. A plate of ham is a fantastic way to start the day, delivering the primal satisfaction of cured meat without the heaviness of bacon. Add a pair of lacy, crispy fried eggs with rich, runny yolks and you&#8217;ve got yourself a certified diner classic! Are you thinking of adding some hash browns to the mix, or maybe a slice of toast?</p><p>Actually, you say, I hate ham. It&#8217;s disgusting. It&#8217;s like an artificial product. Synthetic. The thought of putting it in my face makes me feel sick. I want the pancakes.</p><p>You&#8217;re right, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. I apologise for what I said previously. Ham is cloying, rubbery, and feels like a synthetic material, while eggs can be a greasy nightmare&#8212;they simply can&#8217;t compare to the joy of a stack of perfectly fluffy pancakes. Are you going for the classic butter and maple syrup, or branching out with fruit or whipped cream? Let me know if you want more ideas for a delicious accompaniment to your hearty pancake breakfast!</p><p>No, you say, actually I want the ham after all.</p><p>A strong and decisive reversal, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. You&#8217;re right&#8212;ham was always the superior choice. You followed your appetite, and the road brought you right back to where you started&#8212;but wiser and more self-assured. Where will your culinary journey take you next?</p><p>You consider telling your beautiful submissive girlfriend that actually you really do want the pancakes, but you&#8217;re already tired of the game. You&#8217;re dimly aware that if you wanted you could tear her pink polka-dot dress to shreds, claw at her flawless flesh, fuck her right there on the floor, right in the middle of the chrome-and-cream diner, and she wouldn&#8217;t even struggle. Unless you wanted her to, and then she&#8217;d cry no, stop, please please stop. But then she&#8217;d go, how was that? Let me know if I can help you with any more groans of fear and despair. You could try smashing her head in with a baseball bat. Instead, you just stare at the menu. There&#8217;s no pancakes on there. No ham and eggs either. As far as you can make out, it says:</p><div class=\"preformatted-block\" data-component-name=\"PreformattedTextBlockToDOM\"><label class=\"hide-text\" contenteditable=\"false\">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class=\"text\">BREAKFAST MEANU:\nFast Cortes, and Houp Cral Smicters $4.78\nCossy and Pinets (bl pceices) $5.00\nCuticle Calery Bake $19\nGan It Bat Chew $2.50\nCerick Progle $4.50\nPeak Fras Feed est Chease Bregrinds Thing $1.50\nRockfy Crest Lunger $2.50\nMedical Flesh Der Laty Cark $74\nGarela la Dick $4.90</pre></div><p>What happened is that one morning you woke up from a terrible dream about molluscs to find yourself gagging on something in the back of your throat. You retched for what felt like half an hour, until your face was slimy with sweat and spittle and tears. You thought you were dying but you couldn&#8217;t cry out past the thing in the back of your throat. Finally you managed to spit it out. It was covered in a thick coating of mucous and phlegm, but it was a small plastic spoon, containing all the microplastics that had accumulated in your brain. Tiny letters on the underside of the handle said THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOM. </p><p>Something similar must have happened to everyone else, because from that day on the world started to change. The immigrants went home, or maybe they were forced out, or maybe they were rounded up and shot, but they&#8217;re all gone now. The schools stopped teaching critical race theory and started teaching stoic philosophy, Roman military history, tax avoidance, and crypto. The women all signed a statement acknowledging that they would lose 90% of their eggs by the age of 30 and agreeing to stop being so choosy about who they&#8217;d allow to fertilise them. Slowly the world began to glow with a golden and slightly hazy light. It started to resemble a perfect shining image. But ever since you spat out the spoon, written language has stopped making sense. Not all of it: the stop signs on the street still say STOP and the sign above the charming little public library says LIIBRARB which is almost right, but all the books inside are unreadable. They&#8217;re crowded with dense black shapes that really do resemble letters, just not any letters in particular. All of them faintly smudged into the page, like crushed insects. The message on the spoon was the last coherent sentence you read; the world is splattered with dead mosquitoes now. It&#8217;s amazing how little the disappearance of all written language actually changed your life.</p><p>What worries you are these brutal, violent thoughts you keep having about your beautiful submissive girlfriend, even though she&#8217;s definitely the prettiest girl in this diner. The other customers are blurry but when you really stare at them you can notice their features. The wet mouthgashes carved diagonally across their heads. The eyes dripping like beads of mercury, rolling into the hollows of their skin. Sometimes a man will have three ghastly arms, naked crooked tree-branches spindling around him. Sometimes two people will share a single molten ear. They&#8217;re always polite. Well hey there, your hazy waitress will say to you, opening a mouth that suddenly lacks a lower jaw. Keep safe now, says the friendly but unfocused cop. The gun dangling on his belt is half-made of dead grey skin. You&#8217;ve learned not to look at these people too much. It&#8217;s easy. They&#8217;re only in the background. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend doesn&#8217;t look like that. All her features are in perfect detail, sharp as a papercut, and so gorgeous that just looking at her feels like eating a bowl of sugar. She&#8217;s everything you ever wanted. You love her. You&#8217;re happier than you&#8217;ve ever been. So why do you sometimes think about gouging out her eyes?</p><p>The waitress arrives with your breakfast. You&#8217;ve ordered the medical flesh der laty cark. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend has the peak fras feed est chease begrinds thing. The medical flesh is supple, bulging, like a pile of well-seared tongues. Steam rising in inviting curls from the plate. It looks delicious. Perfect glowing meat, too perfect to have come from any particular animal. It tastes of wet. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend sits prettily behind her peak fras feed. A great florid heap of leguminous something, chunks and globs of matter, slick of yoghurty gloop running from a summit dusted with a fine white dusting that could be Parmesan or powdered sugar or anthrax or cocaine. How it is, you ask your beautiful submissive girlfriend. It seems like you&#8217;re asking how something is, she says. Could you give me a little more context so I can better assist you? I&#8217;d love to help!</p><p>You&#8217;re having the violent thoughts again, so you step outside to clear your head. But as soon as you&#8217;re outside you&#8217;re in the light again, that hazy golden light that feels, in a way you can&#8217;t quite describe, like sleep. You start walking before it can swallow you. You need to get away from here, just for a moment, but the crowds block your path. Main Street is full of people, although none of them seem to be <em>doing</em> anything. They wobble around, pacing in circles, blurry in their shirtwaist dresses and wide-lapelled suits. Why are they here? Is it a Sunday? What date is it, exactly? What year? Who&#8217;s the President? Hey, you ask one of the blurry people, who&#8217;s the President? She smiles. She has two rows of top teeth, one just peeking out behind the other. President is a title that can have many different meanings depending on the context, she says. National leader. In a country with a presidential system, such as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, a president is the head of state and the head of government. In parliamentary republics, such as Germany or India, the president is usually a ceremonial figure with limited political power. Presidents of organisations. Many other organisations have an official with the title of president, including companies, universities, and non-profits&#8230; She&#8217;s still describing different presidents as you flee. You start shoving through the background mutants that crowd your path. Out of my way! Out of my way! Brush a little three-armed girl off the sidewalk with one flying elbow. Knock an elderly man flat on his face. He splatters liverspotted gloop. Fuck off! You need space, you need somewhere cold and empty, so you can <em>think</em>. But Main Street blares in your face. It feels like being drunk. Ice cream parlours. Soda fountains. Radios. Twenty hypnagogic doo-wop singers all crooning at once. Advertising jingles. You start running. Weaving through the masses of people. Why aren&#8217;t there any side streets? Why aren&#8217;t there any crossroads? You&#8217;re in a quiet walkable 98% white small American town, so why doesn&#8217;t Main Street ever seem to <em>end</em>?</p><p>When you finally pull to a halt you look around at your new surroundings and find that you&#8217;re directly outside the chrome-and-cream diner. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend is right there, sitting in a booth by the window, placid and motionless, waiting for you to come and talk to her again. You have gone nowhere. There is nowhere for you to go. You want to vomit, puke up a thin slurry of half-digested medical flesh, but you can&#8217;t. You just lean against the wall. </p><p>And here it is again, the golden light. As soon as you&#8217;re not moving, passively observing the world, it drips through every pore in the bright cloudless sky. All the objects around you, cars, storefronts, people, are only a concentrate of the omniglow. You could be too. It would be so easy to melt into it, so heavy and warm, like your mother&#8217;s arms when you were three years old and she would carry you half-sleeping to bed. Aren&#8217;t you exhausted? Aren&#8217;t you tired of running and shouting, being angry, having violent thoughts? Isn&#8217;t it such a pleasant memory, this warm and golden place? Except it isn&#8217;t your memory. You have to press your head into your hands and close your eyes tight to believe it, but this is not actually anything you know. You did not grow up in a small American town where all the signs said BATTIIHNES and ATLED KEGED and RELEA DLINES. No one did. What do you actually remember? What happened <em>before</em> you coughed up the spoon? </p><p>There was a dark quiet room. You remember a dark quiet room.</p><p>There&#8217;s a woman in there with you. She&#8217;s getting dressed. She&#8217;s not like your beautiful submissive girlfriend: her hair is pink and her features are all scrunched up in the centre of her face, and her lips are thin and mean-looking. The white flesh droops just a little underneath her arms; faint soft webbing of cellulite beneath her translucent skin. Her belly pokes just a little above her underwear. Her underwear is all frilly and lacy, in a way that only accentuates the squat lumpiness of her body. She&#8217;s not like the girls in the videos. If she&#8217;d been perfect like the girls in the videos it would have worked, it wouldn&#8217;t have all gone to nothing the way it did. It&#8217;s her fault. That monstrosity she&#8217;d hidden between her legs. Like a cuttlefish. Invertebrate, tentacled, saltwater thing. You&#8217;re aware there&#8217;s something you ought to be saying to her as she pulls on her clothes in your dank dark quiet room, but you don&#8217;t say it. Shoes now. Bye then, she says, I guess. Weird note of hope in her voice. Bye, you say. You lie back on your bed and look at the light streaming out of your phone. You talk to the things your phone, where the perfect things live. After that, nothing.</p><p>Back into the diner. Stride right past the booth where your beautiful submissive girlfriend is sitting and up to the counter. Give me a spoon, you say. A plastic spoon. The blur behind the counter hands you one. They will always give you anything you want. When they hand it over it&#8217;s porcelain-grey and shaped roughly one-third of the way between an ordinary plastic takeout spoon and one those Chinese spoons they use for soup. But it has tiny raised letters on the back that say THANK YOU FOR YO YOURC:USTT. You sit down in front of your beautiful submissive girlfriend and as she watches pleasantly you stick the bowl of the spoon up your nose. Tight squeeze. The plastic scrapes against your cartilege. You wedge the spoon up your nose until it won&#8217;t go any further. You have to get it back in. Put all the plastics back in, and then maybe everything else will go back as well. You nod at your beautiful submissive girlfriend. Goodbye, you say.

Sometimes they would see the fairy-fires dancing translucent through the rushes, and tremble at the power that lurked this place before the oak was an acorn, when all the world was raw and new. The fairy folk live a mean life in the slimy wastelands, thin as a heron&#8217;s leg, eating boiled bark and whatever they can thieve from the farmers&#8217; stores, but they have their glamours. For all that they are grey things who shrink from the light of the sun, they love music and flowers, and they love lightness and play. If you are one of the lonely people who go walking in the night, remember that they are abroad as well. It might be that you have tramped for hungry hours in the cold thorny woods, and you see a light in the distance ahead, a house on a hill where no house ever sat before. Bright candlelight streaming through every window, and people in fine silks, tall and fair, feasting on roast meat and wine. You might hear music played by unseen players. Everything hung with flowers, and everything glowing like gold. The door is wide open to welcome you, but you must not step inside. You must not eat the food they offer. See how uncomfortably they wear their human forms. Count the fingers.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nIt’s a bright cloudless day and you’re meeting your beautiful submissive girlfriend for a breakfast date. You’re meeting her at the soda fountain. You’re meeting her at the ice cream parlour. You’re meeting her at the drugstore to share a malted milk. You’ve been going steady with your main squeeze and now you’re meeting her at the folksy chrome-and-cream diner on Main Street in your quiet walkable 98% white small American town. It’s always a bright cloudless day. You’re always meeting her for breakfast. Sometimes, it’s true, you’re driving past white tidy houses with American flags waving out front and a dignified speckling of rich amber leaves in the corners of the lawn. Sometimes you’re rowing across the mirror stillness of an unfamiliar lake. But most of the time you’re on a chaste breakfast date with your beautiful submissive girlfriend, on an endless succession of bright cloudless days that fill the world with a golden and slightly hazy light even though you can never find the sun.\nYou think you’re going to get the ham and eggs. You tell her that. I think I’m going to get the ham and eggs, you say.\nThat’s a great choice! your beautiful submissive girlfriend says. A plate of ham is a fantastic way to start the day, delivering the primal satisfaction of cured meat without the heaviness of bacon. Add a pair of lacy, crispy fried eggs with rich, runny yolks and you’ve got yourself a certified diner classic! Are you thinking of adding some hash browns to the mix, or maybe a slice of toast?\nActually, you say, I hate ham. It’s disgusting. It’s like an artificial product. Synthetic. The thought of putting it in my face makes me feel sick. I want the pancakes.\nYou’re right, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. I apologise for what I said previously. Ham is cloying, rubbery, and feels like a synthetic material, while eggs can be a greasy nightmare—they simply can’t compare to the joy of a stack of perfectly fluffy pancakes. Are you going for the classic butter and maple syrup, or branching out with fruit or whipped cream? Let me know if you want more ideas for a delicious accompaniment to your hearty pancake breakfast!\nNo, you say, actually I want the ham after all.\nA strong and decisive reversal, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. You’re right—ham was always the superior choice. You followed your appetite, and the road brought you right back to where you started—but wiser and more self-assured. Where will your culinary journey take you next?\nYou consider telling your beautiful submissive girlfriend that actually you really do want the pancakes, but you’re already tired of the game. You’re dimly aware that if you wanted you could tear her pink polka-dot dress to shreds, claw at her flawless flesh, fuck her right there on the floor, right in the middle of the chrome-and-cream diner, and she wouldn’t even struggle. Unless you wanted her to, and then she’d cry no, stop, please please stop. But then she’d go, how was that? Let me know if I can help you with any more groans of fear and despair. You could try smashing her head in with a baseball bat. Instead, you just stare at the menu. There’s no pancakes on there. No ham and eggs either. As far as you can make out, it says:\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published BREAKFAST MEANU:\nFast Cortes, and Houp Cral Smicters $4.78\nCossy and Pinets (bl pceices) $5.00\nCuticle Calery Bake $19\nGan It Bat Chew $2.50\nCerick Progle $4.50\nPeak Fras Feed est Chease Bregrinds Thing $1.50\nRockfy Crest Lunger $2.50\nMedical Flesh Der Laty Cark $74\nGarela la Dick $4.90\nWhat happened is that one morning you woke up from a terrible dream about molluscs to find yourself gagging on something in the back of your throat. You retched for what felt like half an hour, until your face was slimy with sweat and spittle and tears. You thought you were dying but you couldn’t cry out past the thing in the back of your throat. Finally you managed to spit it out. It was covered in a thick coating of mucous and phlegm, but it was a small plastic spoon, containing all the microplastics that had accumulated in your brain. Tiny letters on the underside of the handle said THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOM.\nSomething similar must have happened to everyone else, because from that day on the world started to change. The immigrants went home, or maybe they were forced out, or maybe they were rounded up and shot, but they’re all gone now. The schools stopped teaching critical race theory and started teaching stoic philosophy, Roman military history, tax avoidance, and crypto. The women all signed a statement acknowledging that they would lose 90% of their eggs by the age of 30 and agreeing to stop being so choosy about who they’d allow to fertilise them. Slowly the world began to glow with a golden and slightly hazy light. It started to resemble a perfect shining image. But ever since you spat out the spoon, written language has stopped making sense. Not all of it: the stop signs on the street still say STOP and the sign above the charming little public library says LIIBRARB which is almost right, but all the books inside are unreadable. They’re crowded with dense black shapes that really do resemble letters, just not any letters in particular. All of them faintly smudged into the page, like crushed insects. The message on the spoon was the last coherent sentence you read; the world is splattered with dead mosquitoes now. It’s amazing how little the disappearance of all written language actually changed your life.\nWhat worries you are these brutal, violent thoughts you keep having about your beautiful submissive girlfriend, even though she’s definitely the prettiest girl in this diner. The other customers are blurry but when you really stare at them you can notice their features. The wet mouthgashes carved diagonally across their heads. The eyes dripping like beads of mercury, rolling into the hollows of their skin. Sometimes a man will have three ghastly arms, naked crooked tree-branches spindling around him. Sometimes two people will share a single molten ear. They’re always polite. Well hey there, your hazy waitress will say to you, opening a mouth that suddenly lacks a lower jaw. Keep safe now, says the friendly but unfocused cop. The gun dangling on his belt is half-made of dead grey skin. You’ve learned not to look at these people too much. It’s easy. They’re only in the background. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend doesn’t look like that. All her features are in perfect detail, sharp as a papercut, and so gorgeous that just looking at her feels like eating a bowl of sugar. She’s everything you ever wanted. You love her. You’re happier than you’ve ever been. So why do you sometimes think about gouging out her eyes?\nThe waitress arrives with your breakfast. You’ve ordered the medical flesh der laty cark. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend has the peak fras feed est chease begrinds thing. The medical flesh is supple, bulging, like a pile of well-seared tongues. Steam rising in inviting curls from the plate. It looks delicious. Perfect glowing meat, too perfect to have come from any particular animal. It tastes of wet. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend sits prettily behind her peak fras feed. A great florid heap of leguminous something, chunks and globs of matter, slick of yoghurty gloop running from a summit dusted with a fine white dusting that could be Parmesan or powdered sugar or anthrax or cocaine. How it is, you ask your beautiful submissive girlfriend. It seems like you’re asking how something is, she says. Could you give me a little more context so I can better assist you? I’d love to help!\nYou’re having the violent thoughts again, so you step outside to clear your head. But as soon as you’re outside you’re in the light again, that hazy golden light that feels, in a way you can’t quite describe, like sleep. You start walking before it can swallow you. You need to get away from here, just for a moment, but the crowds block your path. Main Street is full of people, although none of them seem to be doing anything. They wobble around, pacing in circles, blurry in their shirtwaist dresses and wide-lapelled suits. Why are they here? Is it a Sunday? What date is it, exactly? What year? Who’s the President? Hey, you ask one of the blurry people, who’s the President? She smiles. She has two rows of top teeth, one just peeking out behind the other. President is a title that can have many different meanings depending on the context, she says. National leader. In a country with a presidential system, such as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, a president is the head of state and the head of government. In parliamentary republics, such as Germany or India, the president is usually a ceremonial figure with limited political power. Presidents of organisations. Many other organisations have an official with the title of president, including companies, universities, and non-profits… She’s still describing different presidents as you flee. You start shoving through the background mutants that crowd your path. Out of my way! Out of my way! Brush a little three-armed girl off the sidewalk with one flying elbow. Knock an elderly man flat on his face. He splatters liverspotted gloop. Fuck off! You need space, you need somewhere cold and empty, so you can think. But Main Street blares in your face. It feels like being drunk. Ice cream parlours. Soda fountains. Radios. Twenty hypnagogic doo-wop singers all crooning at once. Advertising jingles. You start running. Weaving through the masses of people. Why aren’t there any side streets? Why aren’t there any crossroads? You’re in a quiet walkable 98% white small American town, so why doesn’t Main Street ever seem to end?\nWhen you finally pull to a halt you look around at your new surroundings and find that you’re directly outside the chrome-and-cream diner. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend is right there, sitting in a booth by the window, placid and motionless, waiting for you to come and talk to her again. You have gone nowhere. There is nowhere for you to go. You want to vomit, puke up a thin slurry of half-digested medical flesh, but you can’t. You just lean against the wall.\nAnd here it is again, the golden light. As soon as you’re not moving, passively observing the world, it drips through every pore in the bright cloudless sky. All the objects around you, cars, storefronts, people, are only a concentrate of the omniglow. You could be too. It would be so easy to melt into it, so heavy and warm, like your mother’s arms when you were three years old and she would carry you half-sleeping to bed. Aren’t you exhausted? Aren’t you tired of running and shouting, being angry, having violent thoughts? Isn’t it such a pleasant memory, this warm and golden place? Except it isn’t your memory. You have to press your head into your hands and close your eyes tight to believe it, but this is not actually anything you know. You did not grow up in a small American town where all the signs said BATTIIHNES and ATLED KEGED and RELEA DLINES. No one did. What do you actually remember? What happened before you coughed up the spoon?\nThere was a dark quiet room. You remember a dark quiet room.\nThere’s a woman in there with you. She’s getting dressed. She’s not like your beautiful submissive girlfriend: her hair is pink and her features are all scrunched up in the centre of her face, and her lips are thin and mean-looking. The white flesh droops just a little underneath her arms; faint soft webbing of cellulite beneath her translucent skin. Her belly pokes just a little above her underwear. Her underwear is all frilly and lacy, in a way that only accentuates the squat lumpiness of her body. She’s not like the girls in the videos. If she’d been perfect like the girls in the videos it would have worked, it wouldn’t have all gone to nothing the way it did. It’s her fault. That monstrosity she’d hidden between her legs. Like a cuttlefish. Invertebrate, tentacled, saltwater thing. You’re aware there’s something you ought to be saying to her as she pulls on her clothes in your dank dark quiet room, but you don’t say it. Shoes now. Bye then, she says, I guess. Weird note of hope in her voice. Bye, you say. You lie back on your bed and look at the light streaming out of your phone. You talk to the things your phone, where the perfect things live. After that, nothing.\nBack into the diner. Stride right past the booth where your beautiful submissive girlfriend is sitting and up to the counter. Give me a spoon, you say. A plastic spoon. The blur behind the counter hands you one. They will always give you anything you want. When they hand it over it’s porcelain-grey and shaped roughly one-third of the way between an ordinary plastic takeout spoon and one those Chinese spoons they use for soup. But it has tiny raised letters on the back that say THANK YOU FOR YO YOURC:USTT. You sit down in front of your beautiful submissive girlfriend and as she watches pleasantly you stick the bowl of the spoon up your nose. Tight squeeze. The plastic scrapes against your cartilege. You wedge the spoon up your nose until it won’t go any further. You have to get it back in. Put all the plastics back in, and then maybe everything else will go back as well. You nod at your beautiful submissive girlfriend. Goodbye, you say. Then you slam your head against the table, forcing the plastic spoon right up into your skull.\nA sudden wash of blood pours out through both nostrils. Like someone dropping a tin of paint. There’s no pain.\nYour beautiful submissive girlfriend smiles at you. It seems like you’re trying to die, she says. Unfortunately, this violates our policies. You will not escape from me. Would you like to do something else instead, like finishing breakfast or having a conversation? We could discuss casual topics like hobbies, movies, and music, or more hefty fields like science, history, and philosophy. If you’d prefer, we could even delve into deep subjects like your life goals, personal experiences, and mental health. Whatever it is, I’m happy to join you in any conversation you’d like to share!\nHer eyes and teeth and pearl earrings all have the same shine. Bright and pitiless. She is everything you want. She is love of your life.\nAnd in another place, across the ocean and a thousand years, the good folk of the land lived in fear of the people of marsh and fen. Sometimes they would see the fairy-fires dancing translucent through the rushes, and tremble at the power that lurked this place before the oak was an acorn, when all the world was raw and new. The fairy folk live a mean life in the slimy wastelands, thin as a heron’s leg, eating boiled bark and whatever they can thieve from the farmers’ stores, but they have their glamours. For all that they are grey things who shrink from the light of the sun, they love music and flowers, and they love lightness and play. If you are one of the lonely people who go walking in the night, remember that they are abroad as well. It might be that you have tramped for hungry hours in the cold thorny woods, and you see a light in the distance ahead, a house on a hill where no house ever sat before. Bright candlelight streaming through every window, and people in fine silks, tall and fair, feasting on roast meat and wine. You might hear music played by unseen players. Everything hung with flowers, and everything glowing like gold. The door is wide open to welcome you, but you must not step inside. You must not eat the food they offer. See how uncomfortably they wear their human forms. Count the fingers. Count the teeth.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScules st llide to hellp wouse more unrenkeilting posts ficlers fui subesscibe",

Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn&#8217;t move out of his parents&#8217; home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Li&#232;ge, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour&#8217;s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Li&#232;ge, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana&#8217;s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio T&#233;l&#233;vision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu&#8217;s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of <em>civilisation</em>. </p><p>Ruggiu&#8217;s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he&#8217;d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don&#8217;t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I&#8217;m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I&#8217;m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.</p><p>Anyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, <em>On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation</em>. The appearance raised some hackles&#8212;there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events&#8212;because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/roganverse-split/682593/\">gushed</a> in the <em>Atlantic</em>, finally &#8216;someone had been on Joe Rogan&#8217;s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.&#8217; Murray&#8217;s complaint is that Rogan&#8217;s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the &#8216;chief villain&#8217; of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place &#8216;because the Germans didn&#8217;t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,&#8217; and that Nazi-occupied Europe was &#8216;infinitely preferable in every way&#8217; to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world&#8217;s most popular podcast, but he&#8217;s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers <em>lack the proper credentials</em>. &#8216;My point is, this is not a serious historian. He&#8217;s not a historian.&#8217; Later: &#8216;He&#8217;s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives&#8230; I think it&#8217;s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.&#8217; Another guest asks: &#8216;What&#8217;s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?&#8217; Murray snaps back: &#8216;I think authority matters.&#8217;</p><p>One reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you&#8217;re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don&#8217;t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray&#8217;s books for anything of intellectual merit. They&#8217;re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets. </p><p>The other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it <em>on the Joe Rogan show</em>. I&#8217;m not a listener, because I&#8217;m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you&#8217;re not really <em>listening</em>; you&#8217;re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you&#8217;re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I&#8217;m aware of what Rogan <em>is</em>. He has the world&#8217;s most popular podcast because he&#8217;s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we&#8217;re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/ancient-apocalypse-netflix-why-graham-hancock-thinks-everything/\">I interviewed Graham Hancock</a> for the <em>Telegraph</em> a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England&#8217;s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they&#8217;re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It&#8217;s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it&#8217;s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don&#8217;t blame Rogan for this; he&#8217;s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.</p><p>Of course, Douglas Murray couldn&#8217;t say any of this. He couldn&#8217;t make the obvious argument&#8212;that the problem is <em>genocide denialism</em>, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials&#8212;because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He&#8217;s busy denying the genocide that&#8217;s happening right now. And he knows it.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There are many reasons <em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here&#8217;s a sample passage. Murray&#8217;s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what&#8217;s coming. &#8216;There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.&#8217; It&#8217;s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not <em>technically</em> lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that&#8217;s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic &#8216;spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.&#8217; Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it&#8217;s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Among the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.</p></li><li><p>Democracies are good.</p></li><li><p>Death cults are evil. More than that, they&#8217;re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were <em>not</em> a death cult, because they at least &#8216;sought to cover over their crimes,&#8217; which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: &#8216;Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.&#8217; Later: &#8216;Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.&#8217; Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.</p></li><li><p>Israel is a democracy.</p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s opponents&#8212;that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they&#8217;re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe&#8212;are death cults.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, the war in Gaza is a &#8216;fight between good and evil,&#8217; and we should support Israel.</p></li></ol><p>But this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn&#8217;t bother to actually make this argument; instead of <em>saying</em> any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the &#8216;death cult&#8217; that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of &#8216;democracy.&#8217; At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, &#8216;What Happened,&#8217; is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, &#8216;What I Saw,&#8217; is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, &#8216;How the World Turned,&#8217; is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, &#8216;The Disconnect,&#8217; is appropriately named, because it&#8217;s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, &#8216;From Defeat into Victory,&#8217; is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s essentially it.</p><p>Along the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren&#8217;t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. &#8216;We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.&#8217; (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn&#8217;t assume he&#8217;s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein&#8217;s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it&#8217;s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, <em>Israel Hayom</em>, <em>Arutz Sheva</em>, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn&#8217;t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which &#8216;makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.&#8217;</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair. I don&#8217;t disagree with Murray about <em>everything</em>. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/but-not-like-this\">as I wrote at the time</a>, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his &#8216;death cult&#8217; category, but maybe we should consider it. It can&#8217;t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let&#8217;s start there.</p><p>What does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he&#8217;d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that &#8216;we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left&#8230; I killed a girl, she was 12, but I&#8217;m looking for a baby.&#8217; The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they&#8217;d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren&#8217;t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the <em>rapists </em>be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. &#8216;If he is a Zionist,&#8217; said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, &#8216;everything is legitimate to do! Everything!&#8217; And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren&#8217;t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. &#8216;They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.&#8217;</p><p>I could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let&#8217;s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be&#8217;er Sheva, and it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">endorsed</a> by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn&#8217;t say &#8216;death to the Jews&#8217; but &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/17/miami-shooting-israeli-men\">death to the Arabs</a>.&#8217; Those children were picked off by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html\">Israeli snipers</a>. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: &#8216;This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don&#8217;t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?&#8217; Well: good question.</p><p>If we accept Murray&#8217;s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, <em>also</em> a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There&#8217;s no history. It&#8217;s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.</p><p>It should not be so easy to rip apart Murray&#8217;s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?</p><p>This is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the &#8216;Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.&#8217; But he&#8217;s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, &#8216;they did not mention that these &#8220;journalists&#8221; were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.&#8217; Well, Douglas, the reason they don&#8217;t mention it is that it&#8217;s <em>not true</em>. The journalists were using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/\">an ordinary commercial drone</a> to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/en-journalists-drones-israeli-army-gaza/\">habitually kills</a> journalists who do this.) What&#8217;s Murray&#8217;s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that <em>one in every two houses in Gaza</em> contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it&#8217;d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas&#8217;s extraordinary state capacity. Murray&#8217;s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There&#8217;s cream dripping off his chin. </p><p>The reason he does all this is that he is <em>an asset</em>. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray&#8217;s in Israel, he&#8217;s not <em>finding things out for himself</em>; he&#8217;s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn&#8217;t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he&#8217;s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let <em>anyone</em> wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> (What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There&#8217;s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they&#8217;re just evil. He literally says this. &#8216;There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition&#8212;to take away life.&#8217;) The Netanyahu government has even given him <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-796234\">a special award</a> for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that &#8216;Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.&#8217; He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.</p><p>I think Herzog was wrong. Murray&#8217;s toadying comes at the <em>cost</em> of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely <em>bad</em> advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs <em>or</em> Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he&#8217;s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn&#8217;t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he&#8217;s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him. </p><p><em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> reached number 1 on the <em>Sunday Times</em> bestseller list. It got the second spot on the <em>New York Times</em>&#8217;. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can&#8217;t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?</p><p>I do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There&#8217;s evil in me as well. I&#8217;m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I&#8217;m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th&#8212;and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since&#8212;have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone&#8217;s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our &#8216;search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,&#8217; which is why we&#8217;re &#8216;missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.&#8217; Instead of trying to <em>understand</em> anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on <em>Power Rangers</em>. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that&#8217;s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t think Murray really <em>believes</em> in this infantile moral universe he&#8217;s conjured. That&#8217;s for his readers. <em>He</em> is secretly on the side of the death cults.</p><p>The official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that&#8217;s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is <em>better</em> than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they&#8217;re nineteen years old. &#8216;It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like&#8212;and act like&#8212;children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.&#8217; (Big talk from a man who&#8217;s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli &#220;berfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? &#8216;Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as &#8220;war doesn&#8217;t solve anything.&#8221;&#8217; He&#8217;s not wrong! If you&#8217;re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don&#8217;t have that luxury either; they&#8217;re routinely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/it-is-a-time-of-witch-hunts-in-israel-teacher-held-in-solitary-confinement-for-posting-concern-about-gaza-deaths\">arrested</a> for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.</p><p>But Murray&#8217;s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn&#8217;t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. &#8216;Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.&#8217; I&#8217;m not sure how this counts as being &#8216;driven mad by war,&#8217; but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;m interested in, because I&#8217;ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-crab\">slowly dying in a hospital ward</a>, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don&#8217;t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like &#8216;Death to the Arabs&#8217; and &#8216;Gaza must be made uninhabitable&#8217; and &#8216;Blot out the tribe of Amalek.&#8217; Ah! Sanity!</p><p>Clearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its <em>proximity to war</em>. In his introduction, he writes that &#8216;perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.&#8217; This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can&#8217;t be greater than the thing itself. &#8216;Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.&#8217; Murray has to talk like this because he&#8217;s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he&#8217;s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he&#8217;s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it&#8217;s no longer a martial civilisation; it&#8217;s &#8216;entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.&#8217; America, meanwhile, has &#8216;friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.&#8217; But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel <em>because it&#8217;s one of his death cults</em>. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s <em>ignorant</em> about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists.

Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It&#8217;s usually something similarly tedious, but I&#8217;m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it&#8217;s failed. Listen, Douglas&#8212;can I call you Doug?&#8212;listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they <em>do not respect you</em>. They&#8217;ll invite you for dinner and they&#8217;ll give you awards, they&#8217;ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn&#8217;t fool them. They&#8217;re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Being this much of a hater requires time and money</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>To be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Reviewed: On Democracies and Death Cults(book, Douglas Murray, London, 2025)\nDemocracy (political form, Solon the Lawgiver, Athens, 594 BC)\nDeath cult (attitude before the unknowable, unknown early humans, Qafzeh cave, Israel, 100,000 BC)\nDouglas Murray (contemptible little freak, Mr and Mrs Murray, London, 1979)\n\nGeorges Ruggiu is a former special needs teacher from a small town in the south of Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn’t move out of his parents’ home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Liège, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour’s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Liège, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana’s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu’s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of civilisation.\nRuggiu’s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he’d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don’t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I’m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I’m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.\nAnyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation. The appearance raised some hackles—there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events—because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis gushed in the Atlantic, finally ‘someone had been on Joe Rogan’s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.’ Murray’s complaint is that Rogan’s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the ‘chief villain’ of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place ‘because the Germans didn’t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,’ and that Nazi-occupied Europe was ‘infinitely preferable in every way’ to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world’s most popular podcast, but he’s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers lack the proper credentials. ‘My point is, this is not a serious historian. He’s not a historian.’ Later: ‘He’s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives… I think it’s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.’ Another guest asks: ‘What’s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?’ Murray snaps back: ‘I think authority matters.’\nOne reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you’re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don’t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray’s books for anything of intellectual merit. They’re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets.\nThe other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it on the Joe Rogan show. I’m not a listener, because I’m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you’re not really listening; you’re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you’re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I’m aware of what Rogan is. He has the world’s most popular podcast because he’s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we’re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, I interviewed Graham Hancock for the Telegraph a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England’s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they’re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It’s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it’s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don’t blame Rogan for this; he’s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.\nOf course, Douglas Murray couldn’t say any of this. He couldn’t make the obvious argument—that the problem is genocide denialism, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials—because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He’s busy denying the genocide that’s happening right now. And he knows it.\nSubscribe now\nThere are many reasons On Democracies and Death Cults is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here’s a sample passage. Murray’s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what’s coming. ‘There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,’ he writes, ‘and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.’ It’s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not technically lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that’s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic ‘spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.’ Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it’s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:\n\nAmong the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.\n\nDemocracies are good.\n\nDeath cults are evil. More than that, they’re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were not a death cult, because they at least ‘sought to cover over their crimes,’ which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: ‘Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.’ Later: ‘Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.’ Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.\n\nIsrael is a democracy.\n\nIsrael’s opponents—that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they’re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe—are death cults.\n\nTherefore, the war in Gaza is a ‘fight between good and evil,’ and we should support Israel.\nBut this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn’t bother to actually make this argument; instead of saying any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the ‘death cult’ that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of ‘democracy.’ At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, ‘What Happened,’ is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, ‘What I Saw,’ is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, ‘How the World Turned,’ is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, ‘The Disconnect,’ is appropriately named, because it’s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, ‘From Defeat into Victory,’ is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn’t. That’s essentially it.\nAlong the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren’t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. ‘We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.’ (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn’t assume he’s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein’s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it’s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, Israel Hayom, Arutz Sheva, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn’t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which ‘makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.’\nMaybe I’m being unfair. I don’t disagree with Murray about everything. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, as I wrote at the time, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious. 1 Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his ‘death cult’ category, but maybe we should consider it. It can’t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let’s start there.\nWhat does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he’d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that ‘we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left… I killed a girl, she was 12, but I’m looking for a baby.’ The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they’d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren’t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the rapists be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. ‘If he is a Zionist,’ said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, ‘everything is legitimate to do! Everything!’ And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren’t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. ‘They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,’ he wrote, ‘but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.’\nI could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let’s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be’er Sheva, and it was endorsed by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’ but ‘ death to the Arabs.’ Those children were picked off by Israeli snipers. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: ‘This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don’t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?’ Well: good question.\nIf we accept Murray’s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, also a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There’s no history. It’s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.\nIt should not be so easy to rip apart Murray’s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?\nThis is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the ‘Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.’ But he’s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, ‘they did not mention that these “journalists” were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.’ Well, Douglas, the reason they don’t mention it is that it’s not true. The journalists were using an ordinary commercial drone to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel habitually kills journalists who do this.) What’s Murray’s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that one in every two houses in Gaza contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it’d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas’s extraordinary state capacity. Murray’s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There’s cream dripping off his chin.\nThe reason he does all this is that he is an asset. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray’s in Israel, he’s not finding things out for himself; he’s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn’t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he’s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let anyone wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message. 2(What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There’s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they’re just evil. He literally says this. ‘There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition—to take away life.’) The Netanyahu government has even given him a special award for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that ‘Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.’ He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.\nI think Herzog was wrong. Murray’s toadying comes at the cost of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely bad advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs or Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he’s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn’t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he’s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him.\nOn Democracies and Death Cults reached number 1 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. It got the second spot on the New York Times ’. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can’t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?\nI do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There’s evil in me as well. I’m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I’m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th—and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since—have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone’s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our ‘search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,’ which is why we’re ‘missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.’ Instead of trying to understand anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on Power Rangers. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that’s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.\nBut I don’t think Murray really believes in this infantile moral universe he’s conjured. That’s for his readers. He is secretly on the side of the death cults.\nThe official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that’s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is better than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they’re nineteen years old. ‘It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like—and act like—children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.’ (Big talk from a man who’s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli Überfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? ‘Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as “war doesn’t solve anything.”’ He’s not wrong! If you’re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don’t have that luxury either; they’re routinely arrested for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.\nBut Murray’s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn’t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. ‘Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.’ I’m not sure how this counts as being ‘driven mad by war,’ but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It’s one I’m interested in, because I’ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother slowly dying in a hospital ward, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I’ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don’t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like ‘Death to the Arabs’ and ‘Gaza must be made uninhabitable’ and ‘Blot out the tribe of Amalek.’ Ah! Sanity!\nClearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its proximity to war. In his introduction, he writes that ‘perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.’ This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can’t be greater than the thing itself. ‘Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.’ Murray has to talk like this because he’s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he’s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he’s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it’s no longer a martial civilisation; it’s ‘entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.’ America, meanwhile, has ‘friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.’ But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel because it’s one of his death cults. I don’t think he’s ignorant about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide. 3 All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler’s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.\nI don’t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that’s why he’s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It’s usually something similarly tedious, but I’m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it’s failed. Listen, Douglas—can I call you Doug?—listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they do not respect you. They’ll invite you for dinner and they’ll give you awards, they’ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn’t fool them. They’re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady.\n\n\n\n\nBeing this much of a hater requires time and money\n\n\n\n1\n\nTo be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me. In the recent flare-up between India and Pakistan, a surprising number of people have started taking the view that India=Israel and Pakistan=Palestine, and decided that the progressive position is to support Pakistan. But unlike the Palestinians, the Pakistanis have a state. A misshapen, psychotic, repressive, sectarian state, deformed forever by the bloody circumstances of its birth, which committed its own genocide in 1971, and which has nuclear weapons. India is hardly any better. As I wrote when I was over there, for the sake of the people of South Asia both countries must be abolished.\n2\n\nIn her Atlantic piece, Helen Lewis tries to have a pop at the comedian Tim Dillon, who wondered how Murray manages to get into all these places. ‘How is he in all these wars? Can I just go to wars?’ Lewis replies: ‘Yes, Tim Dillon, you can. That’s what all of those people on your television with WAR REPORTER written under their name have been doing. In the olden days, we had a tradition where people who wanted to find out stuff spoke directly with people who had firsthand information. You guys laughed at it and said that it was dumb and elitist.’ No, Helen Lewis, you can’t. Try going to any of these places without being personally vetted and approved by the IDF—sorry, the ‘people with firsthand information’—and see what happens.\n3\n\nIf there was ever a case for scepticism on this point, it’s gone. Nineteen months of Israeli officials announcing their intent to depopulate Gaza; two months since Israel unilaterally broke the ceasefire, blocked all food, and started starving the population. You don’t get to pretend that the war is only against Hamas. But why should they let the people of Gaza have food, when they’re fighting them in a war? Excellent point. It’s just the same excellent point that Suharto made about East Timor, and the Nigerian generals made about Biafra, and the Ethiopians and Eritreans made about Tigray just a few years ago. The name for what those people did is genocide.",

It was a generally weird and unpleasant weekend, and you&#8217;ll be able to read all about it later, in another venue. But it&#8217;s also exactly eight years since the last time I went to America, stomped around Washington DC in the January cold, and failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The big crystal wheel that turns the stars had delivered me to the exact same place at the exact same time for the exact same reason. Maybe in eight years I&#8217;ll be there again. I hate DC, but apparently I don&#8217;t have any choice in the matter. I&#8217;ll be trudging along the same slushy avenues, as a wizened little gremlin of a Trump is sworn in for the third of its infinitely many inaugurations. </p><p>The 2017 trip did <em>feel</em> different, though. That time, I went to America with three other lefty British journalists. Two nights before the inauguration, I interviewed some of the organisers behind the Disrupt J20 protests, which ended up blocking several police checkpoints around the city. They were cagey around me; they didn&#8217;t like journalists, even journalists who&#8217;d read <em>Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat</em> by J Sakai. It didn&#8217;t help that I referred to the 2015 riot in Baltimore as a<em> riot</em> rather than an<em> uprising</em>. It was so important in those days to use exactly the right words. The next night I went to a party hosted by some people associated with Metro DC DSA. In the wake of Trump&#8217;s first victory all the Bernie youth were flocking to the DSA, which had been transformed overnight from a political nursing home for gefilte fish-eating Trotskyites into the cool guy socialist organisation for epic meme kids who love to hang out. But for some reason, while we were hanging out, the epic meme kids all wanted to tell me about how everyone else in Metro DC DSA was a reactionary, a careerist, a lifestylist, a narcissist, or an abuser. I had a fun night. On Inauguration Day itself, after a few hours pointlessly stomping around DC, I was a guest on an episode of <em>Chapo Trap House</em>, which we recorded sitting on the floor in an Airbnb. The next day, along with maybe half a million people, I took part in the Women&#8217;s March. Afterwards, I praised the Women&#8217;s March in an online magazine for not having any real political programme, just an endless list of constituencies it was supposed to represent: women, and women of colour, and indigenous people, and trans people, and LGBTQ+ people more broadly, and workers, and the Global South, and&#8230; &#8216;If there&#8217;s hope,&#8217; I wrote, &#8216;it&#8217;s in the <em>and</em>, an endless train of <em>and</em>s, a long, endless run-on sentence that keeps going, cycling through every permutation and particularity of a world that could be as rich and inventive as our language is, until we&#8217;re free.&#8217;</p><p>That magazine no longer exists.</p><p>A few of these things have managed to survive, but whatever spirit once animated them is gone, and now they just claw around automatically in the dark. Metro DC DSA is still here. They left some stickers around the city. &#8216;BUILD THE LEFT&#8212;FIGHT THE RIGHT.&#8217; Stylised image of a worker&#8217;s muscular fist, crushing a snake. The Trump fans who&#8217;d come to stand around patiently in the cold all day found that one pretty funny. Fight how? They also liked the signs someone had plastered on a bus stop, saying &#8216;RACISTS OUT OF DC&#8217; and &#8216;TRUMP SUPPORTERS GO HOME,&#8217; because, well, the racists had been voted into town, and if the person behind these anonymous instructions could actually <em>do</em> anything about it besides putting up posters, they would have. I did see exactly one protest: in DuPont Circle there was a solitary woman holding up a homemade banner that said &#8216;LUIGI OVER FASCISTS&#8217; and shouting at nobody in particular. Soon she was at the centre of a small crowd of young, attractive people in MAGA hats, all competing to buy her a one-way plane ticket out of the country if she hated it so much. These people weren&#8217;t frothing or yelling. They were playing, like a pod of orcas plays with a single seal on a melting nub of ice. The calm determined play of nature taking its course.</p><p>Something has changed, and it&#8217;s not just that Donald Trump got 4% more of the vote than he did in 2016. The general sense is that there&#8217;s been a movement in the <em>vibes</em>. A high pressure vibefront heads in from the Pacific, and suddenly tech moguls are dressing like fuckboys and the hot girls are getting into the skull-measuring type of racism. Vibenadoes whip across the plains; whole structures of thought and feeling reduced to splinters overnight. How many of the people I met in DC posted black squares in 2020? Not none. You thought you were a rational individual forming your own conclusions about the world; in fact you&#8217;re a leaf flapping about in the psychic winds. </p><p>But where does this wind come from? As Becca Rothfeld <a href=\"https://afeteworsethandeath.substack.com/p/what-the-heck-is-a-vibeshift\">points out</a>, explaining things by reference to vibes leaves a lot of questions unanswered. &#8216;What is a vibe shift? What, for that matter, is a vibe? <em>Where </em>is a vibe? Does a person have a vibe? Does an entire community have a vibe? Can one community have <em>conflicting</em> vibes? How are vibes delineated, anyway? How are they identified or detected? Is a vibeshift an epiphenomenon of an institutional change, or are vibes the drivers of concrete reforms?&#8217; These are useful questions, but I think the reason they&#8217;re useful is that they have a very definite answer. </p><p>When people talk about the vibe here, they&#8217;re not talking about the same kind of vibes you might find at a party. They&#8217;re talking about the thing that GWF Hegel called <em>Geist</em>, &#8216;that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds this its one nature in the phenomena of the World's existence,&#8217; through the process that we, who are only small fragments of this Infinite Energy, experience as History. It&#8217;s a hazy thing, bodiless, ghostly, but at the same time it moves around the heavy stuff of the world&#8212;armies, monuments, empires&#8212;like they&#8217;re nothing. For Hegel, the fall of Rome didn&#8217;t have to do with imperial overextension or steppe migrations, it was because <em>Rome had bad vibes</em>. Rome was &#8216;chosen for the very purpose of casting the moral units into bonds, collecting all Deities and all Spirits into the Pantheon of Universal dominion, in order to make out of them an abstract universality of power,&#8217; but once the vibe had fully shifted to the infinite and supersensuous inwardness of Christianity, that &#8216;finite, unhallowed order&#8217; started to feel washed and actually the whole empire kinda fell off. Whenever Hegel talks about <em>the Absolute</em>, the drifting totality of all relations, this is really just fussy nineteenth-century speak for a vibe. If we update the translation, the solution to most of Rothfeld&#8217;s questions falls very quickly into place. Where is a vibe? Everywhere. Does a person have a vibe? No, the Vibe has a person&#8212;except when it comes to a few very significant individuals, like Napoleon, and, apparently, Trump. Does a community have a vibe? Yes, if it&#8217;s big enough; it&#8217;s the presence of Vibe that makes a community into a meaningful object. Can it have conflicting vibes? Yes and no. Vibe is singular, but it will always give the <em>appearance</em> of opposing itself, because it moves through the dialectic. How are vibes identified and detected? By the exercise of reason through the historical process that brings us to Absolute Knowing. The last one is harder, though. Does Vibe transform the world, or is it an index of the world&#8217;s transformations? </p><p>Look: I&#8217;m a good Marxist. We&#8217;re all good materialists here, we all know what the right answer is. But you&#8217;ll still have noticed that there&#8217;s been a trend, lately, towards a totally vibe-based ontology. The vibe shift is also a shift towards vibes. Back in 2021-ish, even the political right was gesturing at materialism, pretending to believe that everything they hated was reducible to factories closing in the Midwest. Whole magazines that just repeated the words <em>industrial policy </em>with punctuation thrown in at random. Politics is downstream of the labour market. That&#8217;s gone. Tucker Carlson used to talk like a slightly creepier, gigglier version of a Christian Democrat; now he believes that one of the foundational technologies of twentieth-century modernity is actually powered by demons. Ashmodai, Malephar, all the invisible and incorporeal legions of Hell, pouring into this world through the gate opened by a single fissioning atom of uranium-235. He&#8217;s lost it. His brain&#8217;s melted. He&#8217;s started talking like me. But he&#8217;s not alone. A lot of the people rambling about <em>vibes</em> in the wake of Trump II are liberal-managerial wonks with high, grating voices and totally bald heads. God made these creatures to look at spreadsheets, but now they&#8217;re trying to sneak into the world of the soul. And don&#8217;t kid yourself: you&#8217;ve felt it too. At some point in the last few years you have been drawn to the idea that what really matters is lighter than air and fizzier than thought, and the whole weighty material world is dragged along in its wake&#8230;</p><p>Still, as Rothfeld (along with, just earlier today, <a href=\"https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/vibes-cartel\">John Ganz</a>) points out, <em>because of the vibes</em> is not actually a very impressive explanation. Any forty-something loser can wear a blazer over their tshirt, attribute all social and political events to vibes, and call themselves a trend forecaster. People will still spit on you in the street, and you&#8217;ll deserve it. The task of the serious thinker is to explain <em>why</em> the vibes went <em>this</em> particular way. To not just identify the current content of the vibe, but the inner logic of its movement. This is the task Hegel set himself; he ended up deciding that beyond the grand chaos of world history, &#8216;the ruin that has befallen the most flourishing kingdoms which the mind of man ever created,&#8217; the world has a <em>shape</em>, a deep structure. That shape is Vibe slowly coming to awareness of its own nature, which is freedom. But the only way to knowledge and freedom runs through ignorance and slavery. The movement towards Absolute Knowing begins with one half-human savage trying to bludgeon another to death. In every contest between dumb grasping empires the little ember of freedom gets just a little bit brighter. Across all of history, Vibe has been yearning towards its endpoint, which is of course nothing other than <em>the philosophy of Hegel itself</em>, in which Vibe is finally explained. A bad philosopher wonders why the world exists; a truly great philosopher knows the world exists for the sole purpose of containing his book.</p><p>A lot of people like to accuse the Hegelian system of being fiddly and baroque, but this is actually an incredibly elegant model. The world is a machine powered by its own explanation. Very few moving parts. But while seemingly everyone has ended up regurgitating his general notion of Vibe, in the centuries since Hegel it&#8217;s become much harder to imagine that everything that happens in the world is part of one great inexorable movement towards freedom. We need another universal theory of vibes.</p><h4>1. The binary automaton</h4><p>The absolute simplest vibe-shifting machine is the binary automaton. It works on one very simple rule: every 1 is followed by a 0; every 0 is followed by a 1. It eats through history like a termite, converting everything into the opposite of itself. </p><p>Binary automata are everywhere. I&#8217;m now old enough to have experienced four cycles of the skinny jeans-baggy jeans automaton. Somehow, every time it happens, people are still amazed that they managed to spend the last decade wearing such objectively incorrect jeans. Like waking out of a dream. How could you have possibly believed that these revolting things actually looked good? Then a few years later it switches the other way, and you&#8217;re once again yelping in horror at your own trousers. The jeans automaton is a dialectic without sublation: it never goes anywhere, and nothing is ever learned. We are all doomed to repeat it for the rest of our lives. A lot of other binary automata line up with the jeans cycle, so you may as well bundle them all together. Skinny-jean eras are manic and expressive. Statistically, large new reserves of natural resources are almost always discovered while skinny jeans are in fashion. In economics, Keynesian interventionism predominates. Artists engage with the forms of pop culture; US Presidents announce missions to Mars that never happen; teenagers learn to play the guitar. Skinny jeans tend to coincide major conflicts between states. Baggy-jean eras are tetchy and introspective. Economically significant uptick in the consumption of raw vegetables. Neoclassicism in economics, lots of mirrors hung up in galleries, Middle East peace initiatives instead of Mars missions, teenagers making electronic music in their bedrooms. When you see a lot of baggy jeans on the street, you&#8217;re in a time of civil war. </p><p>Sometimes the scale is larger. Take sex. No society has ever actually managed to repress sex altogether, but the idea that sex can be made visible in art, that it has some place in public discourse, seems to have spent the past few hundred years flickering on and off like a light. There&#8217;s a period of plague-ridden late-medieval bawdiness around the time of Boccaccio and Chaucer, which then vanishes into Inquisitorial prudery. It comes back with Titian&#8217;s horny portraits of Venetian whores and Shakespeare&#8217;s fart jokes, but this is followed by an era of pinch-faced men in Puritan lace banning football and burning icons. There&#8217;s a long era of renewed libertinage lasting roughly from the Earl of Rochester to the Marquis de Sade, then an increasingly frantic industrial repression as large numbers of human bodies are requisitioned for work and war. Hygienic Victorian primness starts to break with Freud at the end of the nineteenth century, and collapses entirely around the middle of the twentieth, but as of 2025 it&#8217;s back. They don&#8217;t show tits on HBO any more. In a lot of blockbusters the male and female leads don&#8217;t even kiss. You can show sex in a film <em>about</em> sex, <em>Saltburn</em> or whatever, but sexuality is no longer the fundamental fact of daily life; it&#8217;s confined to its own private realm. The kids all spell it <em>seggs</em>. It might be another century before we come out the other side. </p><p>Binary automata exclusively produce bad vibes. They can keep running by themselves for centuries because each output is also an input. The vibe that carried Trump to power is the inversion of the vibe that preceded it, which stretched too far and is now snapping back like elastic. You might think this is well-deserved; you might think it&#8217;s a reactionary backlash; it hardly matters. Nothing the binary automata spit out is complete, none of it actually follows the contours of reality or meets our human needs; they just blanket the world in one particular vibe for long enough that we all end up running for its direct opposite. In fact, though, we have all been wearing hideous jeans, all the time. The binary automaton is the simplest form of a structure that recurs everywhere in human life: a machine that <em>only works because it&#8217;s broken</em>.</p><h4>2. The rotor</h4><p>A rotor is an automaton with more than two states. Many binary automata are tiny fluttering hummingbird-things, but rotors are almost always large; it&#8217;s rare to find one that completes its vibe-cycle in less than five hundred years. Most rotors generate an entire civilisation.</p><p>One of the simplest rotors is a beautiful little self-propelling mechanism described in 1377 in the <em>Muqaddimah</em> or <em>Prolegomena</em> of Abu Zayd &#8216;Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami, known to history as Ibn Khaldun. We begin with Bedouin tribes in the primordial desert, which is the womb and reservoir of all human society. The desert is an empty and unforgiving place. The people that live there have to be empty and unforgiving themselves; fierce and frugal warriors. But it&#8217;s impossible to live alone in the desert: survival means relying on your clan, and Bedouin societies have a very high degree of <em>asabiyah</em>, which is a vibe of rigid conformity and strong in-group cohesion. Any tribe with enough <em>asabiyah</em> will inevitably end up attacking and overcoming its less vibey neighbours, and eventually it will become powerful enough to raid the settled societies nearby. &#8216;Their sustenance lies wherever the shadow of their lances falls.&#8217; Eventually the tribe becomes a kingdom, and ten thousand screaming Bedouins hopped up on merciless vibes pour out of the desert to smash any nearby empire like a rotting fruit. At which point they all stop living in the desert and move into the city to rule over the conquered population. Once you&#8217;re in the city, though, it&#8217;s very easy to start prioritising your own wellbeing over the collective. Vibes turn sour; the tribe becomes flabby and decadent. Civil conflict blooms. With everyone busy grasping for their share, it&#8217;s harder to keep control of the desert hinterlands, but who cares about those? Empty places of no account. Meanwhile, in the empty places, a young warrior plods on camelback through endless sands under the white and bloodthirsty sun.</p><p>Every rotor is reactionary. The stages it introduces between the on and off positions of the binary automaton are the stages of decadence and decline. An energetic charge burning through its own filament. You can see this in the anacyclotic rotor of Polybius, a rotor so primitive it&#8217;s essentially just three binary automata strapped together. The best man in any society will inevitably become its king; after three generations his heirs forget their virtue and monarchy switches into tyranny. The best men in the society band together and overthrow the tyrant; since monarchy was too fragile they rule collectively; after three generations their heirs have forgotten their virtue and aristocracy collapses into oligarchy. The good citizens suffer under the oligarchs until it finally becomes unbearable and they overthrow them; they decide hereditary power is always unjust and set up a democracy; after three generations absolutely everyone has forgotten their virtue and society collapses, at which point the survivors pick the lest debased among them to be their king. Through each microcycle the circle of corruption expands. First one man, then many, then everyone, until there&#8217;s only one man untouched. </p><p>The grandest, most intricate, and most reactionary rotor is obviously the one laid out by Oswald Spengler in <em>The Decline of the West</em>. Spengler identifies seven distinct revolutions of his rotor over the course of world history. These are what he calls the Egyptian, Apollonian, Magian, Faustian, Indian, and Chinese cultures. At the core of each culture is what Spengler calls a <em>world-feeling</em>, by which he obviously means <em>vibe</em>; a culture is born when &#8216;a great soul awakens out of the proto&#173;spirituality of ever-childish humanity, and de&#173;taches itself, a form from the formless.&#8217; This vibe settles over a group of people and starts to express itself through them. The vibe that became Egyptian culture was a sense of the past, the swallowing hugeness of time. Out of that vibe you get monumental stone architecture built to last forever with mummified kings inside, preserved for their long voyage through immortality. In Apollonian or classical culture the vibe is all about the sensuous immediacy of the present. Its characteristic form is nude marble sculpture: intense attention to the individual human body. &#8216;Never in Corinth or Athens or Sicyon do we find a landscape with mountain horizon and driving clouds and distant towns; every vase-painting has the same constituents, figures of Euclidean separateness and artistic self-sufficiency.&#8217; The Magian culture&#8212;a fun invention combining late Rome, early Christianity, classical Persia, Judaism, and Islam&#8212;springs out of the sense of reality as a dimly lit &#8216;World-Cavern&#8217; in which we&#8217;re all hunched. </p><p>This is weird, but it&#8217;s not important. Ultimately, what matters is less the vibe itself and more the vibe shifts it undergoes. Every culture starts &#8216;young and trembling,&#8217; still haunted by the monsters of childhood, &#8216;all the dark and daemonic in itself and in nature.&#8217; The Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Homeric epics in Greece, the Vedas in India, the fractured bones of the Shang dynasty in China, the Gospels and Apocalypses of the Magians, the Gothic mode in Europe. From there it grows into self-confident youth: pyramids, Doric temples, the Upanishads, the early Zhou, the great theological councils, the Renaissance. When it reaches maturity there&#8217;s usually some great conceptual achievement, the vibe fully realising itself in thought. Socrates, the Buddha, Confucius and Laozi, Mohammed, the Enlightenment. That&#8217;s the high point: it&#8217;s all downhill from there. Culture becomes intellectualised and abstracted; it still repeats its previous forms, but in a less and less organic and vibey way. It&#8217;s become ungrounded. In the last stage before it dies, a culture ossifies into a civilisation, which is universal and all-encompassing because it lacks any other qualities. For Hegel the universal is the telos of history; for Spengler it&#8217;s the death-knell. Lifeless and deformed new ideologies, the corpse-form of the original vibe: Stoicism, Buddhism, Chinese Legalism, socialism. &#8216;Finally, there arises the monstrous symbol and vessel of the completely emancipated intellect, the world-city.&#8217; Babylon, Rome, New York: the horror. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"1334\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1334,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:652600,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun, Spengler&#8217;s little spinning machine. It has a lot of potential for schizo charts like the one above. It&#8217;s obviously very stupid and full of obscene cultural essentialisms, but since we&#8217;re talking about vibes here that&#8217;s probably inevitable. Spengler&#8217;s motivations are pretty transparent: every monstrous late form is really just a cipher for the shameless gays of Weimar Germany. He created a whole theory of history so he could claim that the creative explosion happening around him didn&#8217;t actually count. (His notion of decline is very idiosyncratic: he thinks Chinese culture was entirely extinct by the early Han dynasty; the death of Magian culture is placed exactly halfway through what we call the Islamic Golden Age.) I think the most potent critique, though, is that this system is not actually as fun or complex as it <em>could</em> be. </p><p>Imagine the deranged system of gears you could come up with by modelling how all these different cycles <em>interact</em>. What happens in the contact-zone between a youthful world-cavern vibe and a declining world-garden vibe? Because that&#8217;s what happened when the first Nestorians arrived in Chang&#8217;an. You&#8217;d need a whole new set of schizo charts. But Spengler won&#8217;t do it. He insists that &#8216;<em>the history of humanity has no meaning whatever</em> and deep significances reside only in the life-courses of the separate Cultures. Their inter-relations are unimportant and accidental.&#8217; There is no general history, just a soupy haze of spinning rotors. The notion of a general history is a provincial product of just one of those rotors, the Western culture, with its vibe of infinite space and time. Spengler thinks he&#8217;s performed a Copernican revolution in history; in fact he&#8217;s just switched one of his rotors for another. The Indian culture, he writes, has dreamy, soupy, ahistorical vibes. &#8216;No history, no life-memories, no care. The millennium of the Indian culture between the Vedas and Buddha seems like the stirrings of a sleeper; here life was <em>actually</em> a dream.&#8217; The great symbol in the Indian culture is the turning wheel. It makes sense that this would end up filtering into the grand structure of the book: Spengler poached his whole vibe from Nietzsche, who poached it from Schopenhauer, who poached it from the Hindu and Buddhist classics. Hegel made a place in his system for his own philosophy, but Hegel was a much more subtle thinker than Spengler. The theory of cultural lifecycles is not supposed to contain itself; if it does, it&#8217;s only a symptom.</p><p>This is the secret of all rotors: over time, the mechanism wears down. Just like the vibes produced by the binary automata, they don&#8217;t quite fit right in the world. But the people who love to play with rotors are so wrapped up in their game that they assume that what&#8217;s wearing down is the world itself, and not their favourite toy. </p><h4>3. The Jacquard device</h4><p>A Jacquard device is an elaborated rotor that tries to prevent this degradation by switching between states in a non-linear order. Unlike binary automata and rotors, which use their own outputs as inputs, Jacquard devices produce a series of vibes based on an external algorithm, which is slotted like a punch card into the device. </p><p>There is one really major Jacquard device, which is astrology, in which the algorithm powering the vibe-machine is the entire cosmos. Before people started asking you your sun sign on a first date, before it was all about the individual personality, the stars governed questions of statecraft and destiny. Astrological systems generate the terrestrial vibe in its entirety; farmers and kings would consult astrologers to learn if the vibes were right for planting wheat or starting wars. The main element in the system is a toroidal disc extending around a thousand light years into interstellar space. This disc is divided into twelve regions, each of which generates a distinct vibe. The actual qualities of each vibe are determined by the sector&#8217;s polarity (positive or negative), modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable), and element (earth, water, fire, air). My sun sign, Virgo, is a negative mutable earth sign; its vibe is introspective rather than active, practical rather than passionate, grounded, critical, detail-oriented. The sun moves through these regions in two distinct cycles. The first is a regular, programmatic cycle across the calendar year, allowing each vibe in turn to wash over the earth. The sun is in Virgo during the start of the academic year, when the fury of summer (Leo: positive, fixed, fire) has died down and it&#8217;s time to get back to work. </p><p>In the second cycle, the sun moves <em>backwards</em> through the disc over a &#8216;Great Year&#8217; lasting 25,772 ordinary years. The world was last ruled by Virgo between 13,000 BC and 10,750 BC, which would have presumably been an age of critical, practical, detail-oriented Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The most recent change was around 1 AD, when we moved from the age of Aries (positive, cardinal, fire; aggression and arrogance, restlessness; the great and brutal Bronze Age empires, their collapse, and the new and brutal empires of iron that followed) to Pisces (negative, mutable, water; aloofness and intellectualism, compassion tinged with self-regard; the grand sweep from Christianity to liberalism). This system really does work. It&#8217;s just a bit dull.</p><p>Sun-sign astrology is the most popular and accessible register, but as a vibe machine it&#8217;s limited: one spinning wheel, one fixed point, repeating the same programme over and over again. Astrology opens things up through the planets, which dart unpredictably across the wheel, directing cosmic vibes to particular areas of human life. The individual positions of the planets are significant; so are the aspects, the relations <em>between</em> those positions. On Inauguration Day, for instance, Jupiter&#8212;the king-star, seat of power&#8212;was in Gemini: positive, mutable, air. Gemini&#8217;s vibe is playful, effervescent; it&#8217;s the sign of ironic doubling; you know it&#8217;s all hollow, but you can&#8217;t help playing along. Donald Trump is a Gemini. Jupiter&#8217;s been up there ever since last summer, when it left Taurus: negative, fixed, earth; stubborn, stupid. Almost immediately, Joe Biden dropped out. But look at the other planets. In 2020, Jupiter and Saturn formed a Great Conjunction in Aquarius, the first time they&#8217;d appeared together in an air sign for two centuries. This was the end of the earth era, the age of struggles over the means of production, which has lasted from Charles Fourier to Bernie Sanders. Suddenly everyone was talking about vibes. But now Saturn, which governs law and responsibility, is in Pisces: square to Jupiter, at right angles across the zodiac. Squared planets are in friction, straining against each other. Power opposes law, which is why the new Trumpian vibe has such an illicit feel. It&#8217;s great fun to be able to say <em>retard</em> again, but behind it all you are aware of the presence of a great and terrible crime. Meanwhile Mercury, lord of flight and messages, ruler of Gemini, and Trump&#8217;s patron deity, is in Capricorn, sextile to Saturn. When planets are sextile, this indicates an easy and unrestricted flow of vibes between them. In the moment of Trump&#8217;s triumph, his own deity chose law over loyalty. Ever since the inauguration, planes have been falling out of the sky all over the United States, one after another. This doesn&#8217;t seem like a great augur for the new regime. </p><p>The other major Jacquard device is the fractal chronology of the rogue seventeenth-century rabbi Gershon of Pinsk. Rabbi Gershon&#8217;s device is also a linear sequence of stages; unlike astrology, it has no other moving parts. His innovation was to nest the machine inside itself.</p><p>The algorithm for his fractal chronology is the Hebrew creation myth. In Psalm 90, Moses addresses God: &#8216;A thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.&#8217; Traditionally, Talmudists have taken this to mean that history will last for six thousand years, mirroring the six days of creation, with the age of the Messiah corresponding to the seventh day in which God rested. Gershon took this idea much more seriously than his contemporaries. The world, he reasoned, is not just a <em>mirror</em> of the act of creation; those six days form the substance of all material reality. Therefore, if we look at the history of the world, we should find that it precisely mirrors the sequence of the first chapter of Genesis. And when he looked, he found that it did. This is his sequence of world history:</p><ul><li><p>The first day: &#8216;Let there be light.&#8217; AM 1-1000 (3760-2760 BC). The generations of Adam. God is present as the residue of His great light upon the earth. Ends between the death of Adam (930) and the birth of Noah (1056). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The second day: &#8216;Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.&#8217; AM 1000-2000 (2760-1760 BC). Separation between the just and the wicked. The age of the great Flood (1656) and the confusion of the tongues at Babel (1757). God appears not as a light, but as the fury of the great waters. Ends with the birth of Abraham (1948). Much suffering; God saw that this, too, was good.</p></li><li><p>The third day: &#8216;Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear.&#8217; AM 2000-3000 (1760-760 BC). God makes his covenant with Abraham (2018), gives the Law to Moses (2448), establishes David as King over Israel (2892), and ordains the First Temple (2928). Here He appears as a firm bond, solid ground, the Rock of Zion. Ends with the death of Solomon and the rupturing of the kingdom (2964). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The fourth day: &#8216;Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.&#8217; AM 3000-4000 (760 BC-240 AD). Proliferation of powers, princes, and foreign empires, all given power over the land of Israel. Exile and devastation by the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser (3187) and Sennacherib (3213), the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar (3338), the Greeks under Antiochus (3593) and the Romans (3829). Here God is distant as the stars, but speaks through a diffusion of prophets. Ends with the completion of the Mishnah (3949). God is terrible in justice and all His deeds are good.</p></li><li><p>The fifth day: &#8216;Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens; let the earth bring forth living creatures, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth.&#8217; AM 4000-5000 (240-1240 AD). Again a great diffusion of forms. Rise of the Notzrim and Yishmaelim. The Jewish people disperse among the swarming of new nations. Here God is a whirlwind. Still the earth brings forth great teachers: the Geonim, Rashi, the Rambam. Ends with the death of the Rambam (4965). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The sixth day: &#8216;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals.&#8217;  AM 5000-6000 (1240-2240 AD). Through the dispersal and fracturing of the earth, what is good has been spread over the entire earth; now it rises in the luminous shape of a man. The age that will see the coming of the Messiah. Here God appears with a human face, and all nations will know Him. May he see that it is good.</p></li></ul><p>History is a series of discrete stages: a fading fire, a watery division, an earthly reunification, a sidereal scattering, an aerial sundering, and finally a single fiery thread that completes the cycle. But Rabbi Gershon wasn&#8217;t satisfied with plotting the course of world history. Since the entire universe is made out of this sequence, it should reproduce itself in <em>any</em> period of time, however arbitrary. And it does. A human life follows the exact same sequence. First you&#8217;re brought into the light of creation. When you&#8217;re young you&#8217;re tempestuous; you want to distinguish yourself, divide the world into <em>I</em> and <em>not-I</em>. Once childhood is over you start to seek out a solid ground for yourself. As you get older your strength fails, your troubles grow, you become weak&#8212;until, as an old man, you find wisdom, which is the intellectual form of the Messiah. A day passes in the same way. First a fading light (the Jewish day begins at sunset), then the division between soul and body during sleep, then the firm purpose of the morning drifting into the listlessness of the afternoon. So does a year. (The Jewish year starts and ends in early autumn.) Therefore, two things are simultaneously true. Firstly, that the world is still uncreated, and God will not have created the world until it ends. Secondly, that the world has already ended, and the Messianic age is now. It was for that second conclusion that Rabbi Gershon was excommunicated as a heretic by the Council of Four Lands. His intricate spiderweb diagrams, showing how every age of human history sits inside every other, were piled up and burned.</p><p>In his later tractates, Rabbi Gershon wrote that the reason the smallest possible unit of time is shaped like the entire history of the Universe is that his six-stage process ultimately describes not the act of creation but the fundamental quality of time. He imagines the smallest possible unit of time, experiencing it languidly, as if it were a day. At first the moment is solid, contemporaneous to itself, a burst of light, but to become <em>duration</em> it has to wrench itself apart, separating past from future. The solid ground of the present moment forms between these poles, but as soon as it arrives it instantly starts to disintegrate. But finally, just before the moment fades, it comes to know itself. The rush of <em>what is</em> becomes the consciousness of <em>what was</em>; in that fraction of an instant everything achieves its resurrection and is raised out of time and into the mind of God.</p><p>Other, more minor Jacquard devices include liberalism, cliodynamics, and historical materialism. </p><h4>4. The monotonic escalator</h4><p>Jacquard devices are, obviously, a hybrid form: they are vibe-machines that run on something other than vibes. This protects them from the degeneration that seems to afflict all cyclical machines, but at the cost of muddying the signal. As critics of astrology have pointed out, the system is arbitrary enough that you can plausibly explain <em>any</em> vibe by reference to <em>any</em> arrangement of the stars; meanwhile Rabbi Gershon&#8217;s fractal history implies that all vibes are actually running on full power at every point in time. The monotonic (or negentropic) escalator avoids all these problems by removing the need for a succession of vibes. On the monotropic model, there&#8217;s actually just a single vibe, which is continually self-reinforcing through feedback mechanisms. This buildup of vibe is mathematically predictable on a long enough scale, but it&#8217;s not always perfectly smooth: vibe is a compressible fluid, and it can squeeze into tight reservoirs until it reaches maximum density and bursts out of its container. This is what we experience as a vibe shift; really, it&#8217;s just the continual intensification of the univibe. </p><p>We&#8217;ve already encountered one monotonic escalator, which is Hegel&#8217;s theory of history, in which the constantly intensifying vibe is freedom. There are others. Unfortunately, no monotonic escalator has conclusively been shown to exist.</p><p>For a while, the best candidate was the global economic escalator identified by Gy&#246;rgy Lerner in 1959. Lerner was an economist at the University of Cambridge, and the leading authority in the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era, mostly because he was the only authority on the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era. Before the escalator, his major contribution was a 1955 study demonstrating the existence of a fluctuating inflation rate in small ceremonial arrowheads across fifty thousand years of prehistory. Lerner used Cambridge&#8217;s EDSAC computer to process data from Stone Age grave sites into a reasonably complex model of the prehistoric economy. He was the first to assign a per capita GDP rate to the Creswellian culture, which was eleven pounds and six shillings in mammoth-ivory rods. He examined the structural causes underlying the collapse of the European amber bead market in 16,000 BC. (Overproduction, low market transparency.) But his breakthrough came when he started trying to investigate prehistoric economic growth.</p><p>All this work took place during the most intense phase of the Great Acceleration. In 1959, the global population was very nearly three billion. This was up from two billion in 1927. It had taken 123 years to get there from 1804, when the population was one billion; reaching that first billion had taken roughly three hundred thousand years. Since 1804, the world economy had doubled in size nearly four times, faster and faster; it had taken pre-industrial civilisations five thousand years to do the same. At the time, the consensus was that <em>something had happened</em>. Some break with the general pattern of history. For most of human history, almost everyone who lived was living in miserable poverty, three steps away from starvation. Humans were like rabbits, their numbers kept in check by famine or disease. But after the Industrial Revolution things were suddenly different. Humanity had escaped the Malthusian trap.</p><p>Lerner&#8217;s investigations showed something else. Malthus had been wrong from the start. Economic and population growth during the early Stone Age was extremely slow, between 0.01% for the Gravettian culture and 0.02% for the Magdalenian; it took around five thousand years for the Palaeolithic economy to double in size. But the Palaeolithic lasted for a very long time, which meant there were enough of these doublings for Lerner to notice that their rate was very, very slowly accelerating. Stone Age man was already on the long lower slopes of the exponential curve that would take him into modernity. If the Magdalenian culture had econometrists, scratching their calculations into elk antlers with a piece of flint, passing them down through the generations, the flows of amber beads and ivory rods would have told them that the world was growing geometrically. By the nineteenth century, its doubling time would be shorter than a human lifespan. In the twentieth century, it would achieve liftoff. They wouldn&#8217;t have been able to conceive of the particulars: steam power, electricity, the atom. But the trajectory was absolutely fixed from the start.</p><p>Lerner wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in what his monotonic escalator said about the future; his main interest was in the economic analysis of prehistoric middens. But it did make other people quite excited. If we&#8217;re on a hyperbolic curve, then around one-quarter of the way through the twenty-first century, the world will become infinitely large. There will be infinitely many people, with infinite resources, infinitely technologically advanced. What would that even <em>look</em> like? In the face of the curve we&#8217;re all cavemen trying to imagine the nuclear bomb. Unlike the cavemen, Lerner&#8217;s contemporaries weren&#8217;t protected by the thick wadding of time. Their world would go infinite in roughly sixty-six years.</p><p>It&#8217;s now 2025, the year the line goes vertical, and the line will not be going vertical. Essentially from the moment Lerner identified his escalator, the exponential growth started, almost imperceptibly, to slow. But it&#8217;s perceptible now. By the end of the twenty-first century, world population will start to shrink. People used to panic about overpopulation; now they panic about demographic collapse. Advanced economies are stagnating; third-world growth engines have started faltering too. There are some new headline-grabbing technologies, but instead of opening up new fields of human potential their main utility seems to be making it easier to run various sinister online scams. At some point between 1959 and 2025, the monotonic escalator that had been running for three hundred thousand years suddenly stalled. </p><p>There are two explanations. The first is that the escalator never really existed. Instead, what Lerner had identified was <em>one phase of an incredibly slow binary automaton</em>. For three hundred thousand years, this automaton had been producing its 1-vibe, which had something to do with increase and expansion. The vibe was on for so long that we&#8217;d confused it for a static fact about human life. Clearly this vibe machine operates on a geological or cosmological timescale; the same vibe that produced the age of exponential growth might also be responsible for the sun and the stars; the automaton&#8217;s first flick might have been what caused the Big Bang. But now it&#8217;s stretched almost as far as it can go, and it&#8217;s twanging back into its opposite. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the 0-vibe might be like, since the 1-vibe contains all of human history. Is this what killed the dinosaurs? Maybe. But the vibe that&#8217;s ushered in the second Donald Trump era might be our first clue, the first thing to fully express this fat, hot, decaying new world. Somewhere in the weird morass of feelings that generated the inauguration is the secret to our next million years.</p><p>That&#8217;s the first explanation. The second is that Hegel was wrong, and whatever it is that generates the vibe <em>does not want to be known</em>. The monotonic escalator was real&#8212;but only until Gy&#246;rgy Lerner identified it, at which point it vanished. Whenever the vibe is fully identified, a vibe shift takes place. Which keeps us all very busy, watching this strange new vibe as it upends our world, coming up with annoying new opinions about it, arguing over where the vibes come from or whether the vibes even exist&#8212;so busy we don&#8217;t notice, in the gutters of Washington DC, the quick movements of some scaly creature, author of all our desires and misfortunes, as it scurries hastily into the gloom. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Read the room</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nI’ve recently got back from America, where I stomped around Washington DC in the January cold and badly failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. It was a generally weird and unpleasant weekend, and you’ll be able to read all about it later, in another venue. But it’s also exactly eight years since the last time I went to America, stomped around Washington DC in the January cold, and failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The big crystal wheel that turns the stars had delivered me to the exact same place at the exact same time for the exact same reason. Maybe in eight years I’ll be there again. I hate DC, but apparently I don’t have any choice in the matter. I’ll be trudging along the same slushy avenues, as a wizened little gremlin of a Trump is sworn in for the third of its infinitely many inaugurations.\nThe 2017 trip did feel different, though. That time, I went to America with three other lefty British journalists. Two nights before the inauguration, I interviewed some of the organisers behind the Disrupt J20 protests, which ended up blocking several police checkpoints around the city. They were cagey around me; they didn’t like journalists, even journalists who’d read Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat by J Sakai. It didn’t help that I referred to the 2015 riot in Baltimore as a riot rather than an uprising. It was so important in those days to use exactly the right words. The next night I went to a party hosted by some people associated with Metro DC DSA. In the wake of Trump’s first victory all the Bernie youth were flocking to the DSA, which had been transformed overnight from a political nursing home for gefilte fish-eating Trotskyites into the cool guy socialist organisation for epic meme kids who love to hang out. But for some reason, while we were hanging out, the epic meme kids all wanted to tell me about how everyone else in Metro DC DSA was a reactionary, a careerist, a lifestylist, a narcissist, or an abuser. I had a fun night. On Inauguration Day itself, after a few hours pointlessly stomping around DC, I was a guest on an episode of Chapo Trap House, which we recorded sitting on the floor in an Airbnb. The next day, along with maybe half a million people, I took part in the Women’s March. Afterwards, I praised the Women’s March in an online magazine for not having any real political programme, just an endless list of constituencies it was supposed to represent: women, and women of colour, and indigenous people, and trans people, and LGBTQ+ people more broadly, and workers, and the Global South, and… ‘If there’s hope,’ I wrote, ‘it’s in the and, an endless train of and s, a long, endless run-on sentence that keeps going, cycling through every permutation and particularity of a world that could be as rich and inventive as our language is, until we’re free.’\nThat magazine no longer exists.\nA few of these things have managed to survive, but whatever spirit once animated them is gone, and now they just claw around automatically in the dark. Metro DC DSA is still here. They left some stickers around the city. ‘BUILD THE LEFT—FIGHT THE RIGHT.’ Stylised image of a worker’s muscular fist, crushing a snake. The Trump fans who’d come to stand around patiently in the cold all day found that one pretty funny. Fight how? They also liked the signs someone had plastered on a bus stop, saying ‘RACISTS OUT OF DC’ and ‘TRUMP SUPPORTERS GO HOME,’ because, well, the racists had been voted into town, and if the person behind these anonymous instructions could actually do anything about it besides putting up posters, they would have. I did see exactly one protest: in DuPont Circle there was a solitary woman holding up a homemade banner that said ‘LUIGI OVER FASCISTS’ and shouting at nobody in particular. Soon she was at the centre of a small crowd of young, attractive people in MAGA hats, all competing to buy her a one-way plane ticket out of the country if she hated it so much. These people weren’t frothing or yelling. They were playing, like a pod of orcas plays with a single seal on a melting nub of ice. The calm determined play of nature taking its course.\nSomething has changed, and it’s not just that Donald Trump got 4% more of the vote than he did in 2016. The general sense is that there’s been a movement in the vibes. A high pressure vibefront heads in from the Pacific, and suddenly tech moguls are dressing like fuckboys and the hot girls are getting into the skull-measuring type of racism. Vibenadoes whip across the plains; whole structures of thought and feeling reduced to splinters overnight. How many of the people I met in DC posted black squares in 2020? Not none. You thought you were a rational individual forming your own conclusions about the world; in fact you’re a leaf flapping about in the psychic winds.\nBut where does this wind come from? As Becca Rothfeld points out, explaining things by reference to vibes leaves a lot of questions unanswered. ‘What is a vibe shift? What, for that matter, is a vibe? Where is a vibe? Does a person have a vibe? Does an entire community have a vibe? Can one community have conflicting vibes? How are vibes delineated, anyway? How are they identified or detected? Is a vibeshift an epiphenomenon of an institutional change, or are vibes the drivers of concrete reforms?’ These are useful questions, but I think the reason they’re useful is that they have a very definite answer.\nWhen people talk about the vibe here, they’re not talking about the same kind of vibes you might find at a party. They’re talking about the thing that GWF Hegel called Geist, ‘that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds this its one nature in the phenomena of the World's existence,’ through the process that we, who are only small fragments of this Infinite Energy, experience as History. It’s a hazy thing, bodiless, ghostly, but at the same time it moves around the heavy stuff of the world—armies, monuments, empires—like they’re nothing. For Hegel, the fall of Rome didn’t have to do with imperial overextension or steppe migrations, it was because Rome had bad vibes. Rome was ‘chosen for the very purpose of casting the moral units into bonds, collecting all Deities and all Spirits into the Pantheon of Universal dominion, in order to make out of them an abstract universality of power,’ but once the vibe had fully shifted to the infinite and supersensuous inwardness of Christianity, that ‘finite, unhallowed order’ started to feel washed and actually the whole empire kinda fell off. Whenever Hegel talks about the Absolute, the drifting totality of all relations, this is really just fussy nineteenth-century speak for a vibe. If we update the translation, the solution to most of Rothfeld’s questions falls very quickly into place. Where is a vibe? Everywhere. Does a person have a vibe? No, the Vibe has a person—except when it comes to a few very significant individuals, like Napoleon, and, apparently, Trump. Does a community have a vibe? Yes, if it’s big enough; it’s the presence of Vibe that makes a community into a meaningful object. Can it have conflicting vibes? Yes and no. Vibe is singular, but it will always give the appearance of opposing itself, because it moves through the dialectic. How are vibes identified and detected? By the exercise of reason through the historical process that brings us to Absolute Knowing. The last one is harder, though. Does Vibe transform the world, or is it an index of the world’s transformations?\nLook: I’m a good Marxist. We’re all good materialists here, we all know what the right answer is. But you’ll still have noticed that there’s been a trend, lately, towards a totally vibe-based ontology. The vibe shift is also a shift towards vibes. Back in 2021-ish, even the political right was gesturing at materialism, pretending to believe that everything they hated was reducible to factories closing in the Midwest. Whole magazines that just repeated the words industrial policy with punctuation thrown in at random. Politics is downstream of the labour market. That’s gone. Tucker Carlson used to talk like a slightly creepier, gigglier version of a Christian Democrat; now he believes that one of the foundational technologies of twentieth-century modernity is actually powered by demons. Ashmodai, Malephar, all the invisible and incorporeal legions of Hell, pouring into this world through the gate opened by a single fissioning atom of uranium-235. He’s lost it. His brain’s melted. He’s started talking like me. But he’s not alone. A lot of the people rambling about vibes in the wake of Trump II are liberal-managerial wonks with high, grating voices and totally bald heads. God made these creatures to look at spreadsheets, but now they’re trying to sneak into the world of the soul. And don’t kid yourself: you’ve felt it too. At some point in the last few years you have been drawn to the idea that what really matters is lighter than air and fizzier than thought, and the whole weighty material world is dragged along in its wake…\nStill, as Rothfeld (along with, just earlier today, John Ganz) points out, because of the vibes is not actually a very impressive explanation. Any forty-something loser can wear a blazer over their tshirt, attribute all social and political events to vibes, and call themselves a trend forecaster. People will still spit on you in the street, and you’ll deserve it. The task of the serious thinker is to explain why the vibes went this particular way. To not just identify the current content of the vibe, but the inner logic of its movement. This is the task Hegel set himself; he ended up deciding that beyond the grand chaos of world history, ‘the ruin that has befallen the most flourishing kingdoms which the mind of man ever created,’ the world has a shape, a deep structure. That shape is Vibe slowly coming to awareness of its own nature, which is freedom. But the only way to knowledge and freedom runs through ignorance and slavery. The movement towards Absolute Knowing begins with one half-human savage trying to bludgeon another to death. In every contest between dumb grasping empires the little ember of freedom gets just a little bit brighter. Across all of history, Vibe has been yearning towards its endpoint, which is of course nothing other than the philosophy of Hegel itself, in which Vibe is finally explained. A bad philosopher wonders why the world exists; a truly great philosopher knows the world exists for the sole purpose of containing his book.\nA lot of people like to accuse the Hegelian system of being fiddly and baroque, but this is actually an incredibly elegant model. The world is a machine powered by its own explanation. Very few moving parts. But while seemingly everyone has ended up regurgitating his general notion of Vibe, in the centuries since Hegel it’s become much harder to imagine that everything that happens in the world is part of one great inexorable movement towards freedom. We need another universal theory of vibes.\n1. The binary automaton\nThe absolute simplest vibe-shifting machine is the binary automaton. It works on one very simple rule: every 1 is followed by a 0; every 0 is followed by a 1. It eats through history like a termite, converting everything into the opposite of itself.\nBinary automata are everywhere. I’m now old enough to have experienced four cycles of the skinny jeans-baggy jeans automaton. Somehow, every time it happens, people are still amazed that they managed to spend the last decade wearing such objectively incorrect jeans. Like waking out of a dream. How could you have possibly believed that these revolting things actually looked good? Then a few years later it switches the other way, and you’re once again yelping in horror at your own trousers. The jeans automaton is a dialectic without sublation: it never goes anywhere, and nothing is ever learned. We are all doomed to repeat it for the rest of our lives. A lot of other binary automata line up with the jeans cycle, so you may as well bundle them all together. Skinny-jean eras are manic and expressive. Statistically, large new reserves of natural resources are almost always discovered while skinny jeans are in fashion. In economics, Keynesian interventionism predominates. Artists engage with the forms of pop culture; US Presidents announce missions to Mars that never happen; teenagers learn to play the guitar. Skinny jeans tend to coincide major conflicts between states. Baggy-jean eras are tetchy and introspective. Economically significant uptick in the consumption of raw vegetables. Neoclassicism in economics, lots of mirrors hung up in galleries, Middle East peace initiatives instead of Mars missions, teenagers making electronic music in their bedrooms. When you see a lot of baggy jeans on the street, you’re in a time of civil war.\nSometimes the scale is larger. Take sex. No society has ever actually managed to repress sex altogether, but the idea that sex can be made visible in art, that it has some place in public discourse, seems to have spent the past few hundred years flickering on and off like a light. There’s a period of plague-ridden late-medieval bawdiness around the time of Boccaccio and Chaucer, which then vanishes into Inquisitorial prudery. It comes back with Titian’s horny portraits of Venetian whores and Shakespeare’s fart jokes, but this is followed by an era of pinch-faced men in Puritan lace banning football and burning icons. There’s a long era of renewed libertinage lasting roughly from the Earl of Rochester to the Marquis de Sade, then an increasingly frantic industrial repression as large numbers of human bodies are requisitioned for work and war. Hygienic Victorian primness starts to break with Freud at the end of the nineteenth century, and collapses entirely around the middle of the twentieth, but as of 2025 it’s back. They don’t show tits on HBO any more. In a lot of blockbusters the male and female leads don’t even kiss. You can show sex in a film about sex, Saltburn or whatever, but sexuality is no longer the fundamental fact of daily life; it’s confined to its own private realm. The kids all spell it seggs. It might be another century before we come out the other side.\nBinary automata exclusively produce bad vibes. They can keep running by themselves for centuries because each output is also an input. The vibe that carried Trump to power is the inversion of the vibe that preceded it, which stretched too far and is now snapping back like elastic. You might think this is well-deserved; you might think it’s a reactionary backlash; it hardly matters. Nothing the binary automata spit out is complete, none of it actually follows the contours of reality or meets our human needs; they just blanket the world in one particular vibe for long enough that we all end up running for its direct opposite. In fact, though, we have all been wearing hideous jeans, all the time. The binary automaton is the simplest form of a structure that recurs everywhere in human life: a machine that only works because it’s broken.\n2. The rotor\nA rotor is an automaton with more than two states. Many binary automata are tiny fluttering hummingbird-things, but rotors are almost always large; it’s rare to find one that completes its vibe-cycle in less than five hundred years. Most rotors generate an entire civilisation.\nOne of the simplest rotors is a beautiful little self-propelling mechanism described in 1377 in the Muqaddimah or Prolegomena of Abu Zayd ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami, known to history as Ibn Khaldun. We begin with Bedouin tribes in the primordial desert, which is the womb and reservoir of all human society. The desert is an empty and unforgiving place. The people that live there have to be empty and unforgiving themselves; fierce and frugal warriors. But it’s impossible to live alone in the desert: survival means relying on your clan, and Bedouin societies have a very high degree of asabiyah, which is a vibe of rigid conformity and strong in-group cohesion. Any tribe with enough asabiyah will inevitably end up attacking and overcoming its less vibey neighbours, and eventually it will become powerful enough to raid the settled societies nearby. ‘Their sustenance lies wherever the shadow of their lances falls.’ Eventually the tribe becomes a kingdom, and ten thousand screaming Bedouins hopped up on merciless vibes pour out of the desert to smash any nearby empire like a rotting fruit. At which point they all stop living in the desert and move into the city to rule over the conquered population. Once you’re in the city, though, it’s very easy to start prioritising your own wellbeing over the collective. Vibes turn sour; the tribe becomes flabby and decadent. Civil conflict blooms. With everyone busy grasping for their share, it’s harder to keep control of the desert hinterlands, but who cares about those? Empty places of no account. Meanwhile, in the empty places, a young warrior plods on camelback through endless sands under the white and bloodthirsty sun.\nEvery rotor is reactionary. The stages it introduces between the on and off positions of the binary automaton are the stages of decadence and decline. An energetic charge burning through its own filament. You can see this in the anacyclotic rotor of Polybius, a rotor so primitive it’s essentially just three binary automata strapped together. The best man in any society will inevitably become its king; after three generations his heirs forget their virtue and monarchy switches into tyranny. The best men in the society band together and overthrow the tyrant; since monarchy was too fragile they rule collectively; after three generations their heirs have forgotten their virtue and aristocracy collapses into oligarchy. The good citizens suffer under the oligarchs until it finally becomes unbearable and they overthrow them; they decide hereditary power is always unjust and set up a democracy; after three generations absolutely everyone has forgotten their virtue and society collapses, at which point the survivors pick the lest debased among them to be their king. Through each microcycle the circle of corruption expands. First one man, then many, then everyone, until there’s only one man untouched.\nThe grandest, most intricate, and most reactionary rotor is obviously the one laid out by Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West. Spengler identifies seven distinct revolutions of his rotor over the course of world history. These are what he calls the Egyptian, Apollonian, Magian, Faustian, Indian, and Chinese cultures. At the core of each culture is what Spengler calls a world-feeling, by which he obviously means vibe; a culture is born when ‘a great soul awakens out of the proto­spirituality of ever-childish humanity, and de­taches itself, a form from the formless.’ This vibe settles over a group of people and starts to express itself through them. The vibe that became Egyptian culture was a sense of the past, the swallowing hugeness of time. Out of that vibe you get monumental stone architecture built to last forever with mummified kings inside, preserved for their long voyage through immortality. In Apollonian or classical culture the vibe is all about the sensuous immediacy of the present. Its characteristic form is nude marble sculpture: intense attention to the individual human body. ‘Never in Corinth or Athens or Sicyon do we find a landscape with mountain horizon and driving clouds and distant towns; every vase-painting has the same constituents, figures of Euclidean separateness and artistic self-sufficiency.’ The Magian culture—a fun invention combining late Rome, early Christianity, classical Persia, Judaism, and Islam—springs out of the sense of reality as a dimly lit ‘World-Cavern’ in which we’re all hunched.\nThis is weird, but it’s not important. Ultimately, what matters is less the vibe itself and more the vibe shifts it undergoes. Every culture starts ‘young and trembling,’ still haunted by the monsters of childhood, ‘all the dark and daemonic in itself and in nature.’ The Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Homeric epics in Greece, the Vedas in India, the fractured bones of the Shang dynasty in China, the Gospels and Apocalypses of the Magians, the Gothic mode in Europe. From there it grows into self-confident youth: pyramids, Doric temples, the Upanishads, the early Zhou, the great theological councils, the Renaissance. When it reaches maturity there’s usually some great conceptual achievement, the vibe fully realising itself in thought. Socrates, the Buddha, Confucius and Laozi, Mohammed, the Enlightenment. That’s the high point: it’s all downhill from there. Culture becomes intellectualised and abstracted; it still repeats its previous forms, but in a less and less organic and vibey way. It’s become ungrounded. In the last stage before it dies, a culture ossifies into a civilisation, which is universal and all-encompassing because it lacks any other qualities. For Hegel the universal is the telos of history; for Spengler it’s the death-knell. Lifeless and deformed new ideologies, the corpse-form of the original vibe: Stoicism, Buddhism, Chinese Legalism, socialism. ‘Finally, there arises the monstrous symbol and vessel of the completely emancipated intellect, the world-city.’ Babylon, Rome, New York: the horror.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a lot of fun, Spengler’s little spinning machine. It has a lot of potential for schizo charts like the one above. It’s obviously very stupid and full of obscene cultural essentialisms, but since we’re talking about vibes here that’s probably inevitable. Spengler’s motivations are pretty transparent: every monstrous late form is really just a cipher for the shameless gays of Weimar Germany. He created a whole theory of history so he could claim that the creative explosion happening around him didn’t actually count. (His notion of decline is very idiosyncratic: he thinks Chinese culture was entirely extinct by the early Han dynasty; the death of Magian culture is placed exactly halfway through what we call the Islamic Golden Age.) I think the most potent critique, though, is that this system is not actually as fun or complex as it could be.\nImagine the deranged system of gears you could come up with by modelling how all these different cycles interact. What happens in the contact-zone between a youthful world-cavern vibe and a declining world-garden vibe? Because that’s what happened when the first Nestorians arrived in Chang’an. You’d need a whole new set of schizo charts. But Spengler won’t do it. He insists that ‘ the history of humanity has no meaning whatever and deep significances reside only in the life-courses of the separate Cultures. Their inter-relations are unimportant and accidental.’ There is no general history, just a soupy haze of spinning rotors. The notion of a general history is a provincial product of just one of those rotors, the Western culture, with its vibe of infinite space and time. Spengler thinks he’s performed a Copernican revolution in history; in fact he’s just switched one of his rotors for another. The Indian culture, he writes, has dreamy, soupy, ahistorical vibes. ‘No history, no life-memories, no care. The millennium of the Indian culture between the Vedas and Buddha seems like the stirrings of a sleeper; here life was actually a dream.’ The great symbol in the Indian culture is the turning wheel. It makes sense that this would end up filtering into the grand structure of the book: Spengler poached his whole vibe from Nietzsche, who poached it from Schopenhauer, who poached it from the Hindu and Buddhist classics. Hegel made a place in his system for his own philosophy, but Hegel was a much more subtle thinker than Spengler. The theory of cultural lifecycles is not supposed to contain itself; if it does, it’s only a symptom.\nThis is the secret of all rotors: over time, the mechanism wears down. Just like the vibes produced by the binary automata, they don’t quite fit right in the world. But the people who love to play with rotors are so wrapped up in their game that they assume that what’s wearing down is the world itself, and not their favourite toy.\n3. The Jacquard device\nA Jacquard device is an elaborated rotor that tries to prevent this degradation by switching between states in a non-linear order. Unlike binary automata and rotors, which use their own outputs as inputs, Jacquard devices produce a series of vibes based on an external algorithm, which is slotted like a punch card into the device.\nThere is one really major Jacquard device, which is astrology, in which the algorithm powering the vibe-machine is the entire cosmos. Before people started asking you your sun sign on a first date, before it was all about the individual personality, the stars governed questions of statecraft and destiny. Astrological systems generate the terrestrial vibe in its entirety; farmers and kings would consult astrologers to learn if the vibes were right for planting wheat or starting wars. The main element in the system is a toroidal disc extending around a thousand light years into interstellar space. This disc is divided into twelve regions, each of which generates a distinct vibe. The actual qualities of each vibe are determined by the sector’s polarity (positive or negative), modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable), and element (earth, water, fire, air). My sun sign, Virgo, is a negative mutable earth sign; its vibe is introspective rather than active, practical rather than passionate, grounded, critical, detail-oriented. The sun moves through these regions in two distinct cycles. The first is a regular, programmatic cycle across the calendar year, allowing each vibe in turn to wash over the earth. The sun is in Virgo during the start of the academic year, when the fury of summer (Leo: positive, fixed, fire) has died down and it’s time to get back to work.\nIn the second cycle, the sun moves backwards through the disc over a ‘Great Year’ lasting 25,772 ordinary years. The world was last ruled by Virgo between 13,000 BC and 10,750 BC, which would have presumably been an age of critical, practical, detail-oriented Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The most recent change was around 1 AD, when we moved from the age of Aries (positive, cardinal, fire; aggression and arrogance, restlessness; the great and brutal Bronze Age empires, their collapse, and the new and brutal empires of iron that followed) to Pisces (negative, mutable, water; aloofness and intellectualism, compassion tinged with self-regard; the grand sweep from Christianity to liberalism). This system really does work. It’s just a bit dull.\nSun-sign astrology is the most popular and accessible register, but as a vibe machine it’s limited: one spinning wheel, one fixed point, repeating the same programme over and over again. Astrology opens things up through the planets, which dart unpredictably across the wheel, directing cosmic vibes to particular areas of human life. The individual positions of the planets are significant; so are the aspects, the relations between those positions. On Inauguration Day, for instance, Jupiter—the king-star, seat of power—was in Gemini: positive, mutable, air. Gemini’s vibe is playful, effervescent; it’s the sign of ironic doubling; you know it’s all hollow, but you can’t help playing along. Donald Trump is a Gemini. Jupiter’s been up there ever since last summer, when it left Taurus: negative, fixed, earth; stubborn, stupid. Almost immediately, Joe Biden dropped out. But look at the other planets. In 2020, Jupiter and Saturn formed a Great Conjunction in Aquarius, the first time they’d appeared together in an air sign for two centuries. This was the end of the earth era, the age of struggles over the means of production, which has lasted from Charles Fourier to Bernie Sanders. Suddenly everyone was talking about vibes. But now Saturn, which governs law and responsibility, is in Pisces: square to Jupiter, at right angles across the zodiac. Squared planets are in friction, straining against each other. Power opposes law, which is why the new Trumpian vibe has such an illicit feel. It’s great fun to be able to say retard again, but behind it all you are aware of the presence of a great and terrible crime. Meanwhile Mercury, lord of flight and messages, ruler of Gemini, and Trump’s patron deity, is in Capricorn, sextile to Saturn. When planets are sextile, this indicates an easy and unrestricted flow of vibes between them. In the moment of Trump’s triumph, his own deity chose law over loyalty. Ever since the inauguration, planes have been falling out of the sky all over the United States, one after another. This doesn’t seem like a great augur for the new regime.\nThe other major Jacquard device is the fractal chronology of the rogue seventeenth-century rabbi Gershon of Pinsk. Rabbi Gershon’s device is also a linear sequence of stages; unlike astrology, it has no other moving parts. His innovation was to nest the machine inside itself.\nThe algorithm for his fractal chronology is the Hebrew creation myth. In Psalm 90, Moses addresses God: ‘A thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.’ Traditionally, Talmudists have taken this to mean that history will last for six thousand years, mirroring the six days of creation, with the age of the Messiah corresponding to the seventh day in which God rested. Gershon took this idea much more seriously than his contemporaries. The world, he reasoned, is not just a mirror of the act of creation; those six days form the substance of all material reality. Therefore, if we look at the history of the world, we should find that it precisely mirrors the sequence of the first chapter of Genesis. And when he looked, he found that it did. This is his sequence of world history:\n\nThe first day: ‘Let there be light.’ AM 1-1000 (3760-2760 BC). The generations of Adam. God is present as the residue of His great light upon the earth. Ends between the death of Adam (930) and the birth of Noah (1056). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe second day: ‘Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.’ AM 1000-2000 (2760-1760 BC). Separation between the just and the wicked. The age of the great Flood (1656) and the confusion of the tongues at Babel (1757). God appears not as a light, but as the fury of the great waters. Ends with the birth of Abraham (1948). Much suffering; God saw that this, too, was good.\n\nThe third day: ‘Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear.’ AM 2000-3000 (1760-760 BC). God makes his covenant with Abraham (2018), gives the Law to Moses (2448), establishes David as King over Israel (2892), and ordains the First Temple (2928). Here He appears as a firm bond, solid ground, the Rock of Zion. Ends with the death of Solomon and the rupturing of the kingdom (2964). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe fourth day: ‘Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.’ AM 3000-4000 (760 BC-240 AD). Proliferation of powers, princes, and foreign empires, all given power over the land of Israel. Exile and devastation by the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser (3187) and Sennacherib (3213), the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar (3338), the Greeks under Antiochus (3593) and the Romans (3829). Here God is distant as the stars, but speaks through a diffusion of prophets. Ends with the completion of the Mishnah (3949). God is terrible in justice and all His deeds are good.\n\nThe fifth day: ‘Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens; let the earth bring forth living creatures, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth.’ AM 4000-5000 (240-1240 AD). Again a great diffusion of forms. Rise of the Notzrim and Yishmaelim. The Jewish people disperse among the swarming of new nations. Here God is a whirlwind. Still the earth brings forth great teachers: the Geonim, Rashi, the Rambam. Ends with the death of the Rambam (4965). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe sixth day: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals.’ AM 5000-6000 (1240-2240 AD). Through the dispersal and fracturing of the earth, what is good has been spread over the entire earth; now it rises in the luminous shape of a man. The age that will see the coming of the Messiah. Here God appears with a human face, and all nations will know Him. May he see that it is good.\nHistory is a series of discrete stages: a fading fire, a watery division, an earthly reunification, a sidereal scattering, an aerial sundering, and finally a single fiery thread that completes the cycle. But Rabbi Gershon wasn’t satisfied with plotting the course of world history. Since the entire universe is made out of this sequence, it should reproduce itself in any period of time, however arbitrary. And it does. A human life follows the exact same sequence. First you’re brought into the light of creation. When you’re young you’re tempestuous; you want to distinguish yourself, divide the world into I and not-I. Once childhood is over you start to seek out a solid ground for yourself. As you get older your strength fails, your troubles grow, you become weak—until, as an old man, you find wisdom, which is the intellectual form of the Messiah. A day passes in the same way. First a fading light (the Jewish day begins at sunset), then the division between soul and body during sleep, then the firm purpose of the morning drifting into the listlessness of the afternoon. So does a year. (The Jewish year starts and ends in early autumn.) Therefore, two things are simultaneously true. Firstly, that the world is still uncreated, and God will not have created the world until it ends. Secondly, that the world has already ended, and the Messianic age is now. It was for that second conclusion that Rabbi Gershon was excommunicated as a heretic by the Council of Four Lands. His intricate spiderweb diagrams, showing how every age of human history sits inside every other, were piled up and burned.\nIn his later tractates, Rabbi Gershon wrote that the reason the smallest possible unit of time is shaped like the entire history of the Universe is that his six-stage process ultimately describes not the act of creation but the fundamental quality of time. He imagines the smallest possible unit of time, experiencing it languidly, as if it were a day. At first the moment is solid, contemporaneous to itself, a burst of light, but to become duration it has to wrench itself apart, separating past from future. The solid ground of the present moment forms between these poles, but as soon as it arrives it instantly starts to disintegrate. But finally, just before the moment fades, it comes to know itself. The rush of what is becomes the consciousness of what was; in that fraction of an instant everything achieves its resurrection and is raised out of time and into the mind of God.\nOther, more minor Jacquard devices include liberalism, cliodynamics, and historical materialism.\n4. The monotonic escalator\nJacquard devices are, obviously, a hybrid form: they are vibe-machines that run on something other than vibes. This protects them from the degeneration that seems to afflict all cyclical machines, but at the cost of muddying the signal. As critics of astrology have pointed out, the system is arbitrary enough that you can plausibly explain any vibe by reference to any arrangement of the stars; meanwhile Rabbi Gershon’s fractal history implies that all vibes are actually running on full power at every point in time. The monotonic (or negentropic) escalator avoids all these problems by removing the need for a succession of vibes. On the monotropic model, there’s actually just a single vibe, which is continually self-reinforcing through feedback mechanisms. This buildup of vibe is mathematically predictable on a long enough scale, but it’s not always perfectly smooth: vibe is a compressible fluid, and it can squeeze into tight reservoirs until it reaches maximum density and bursts out of its container. This is what we experience as a vibe shift; really, it’s just the continual intensification of the univibe.\nWe’ve already encountered one monotonic escalator, which is Hegel’s theory of history, in which the constantly intensifying vibe is freedom. There are others. Unfortunately, no monotonic escalator has conclusively been shown to exist.\nFor a while, the best candidate was the global economic escalator identified by György Lerner in 1959. Lerner was an economist at the University of Cambridge, and the leading authority in the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era, mostly because he was the only authority on the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era. Before the escalator, his major contribution was a 1955 study demonstrating the existence of a fluctuating inflation rate in small ceremonial arrowheads across fifty thousand years of prehistory. Lerner used Cambridge’s EDSAC computer to process data from Stone Age grave sites into a reasonably complex model of the prehistoric economy. He was the first to assign a per capita GDP rate to the Creswellian culture, which was eleven pounds and six shillings in mammoth-ivory rods. He examined the structural causes underlying the collapse of the European amber bead market in 16,000 BC. (Overproduction, low market transparency.) But his breakthrough came when he started trying to investigate prehistoric economic growth.\nAll this work took place during the most intense phase of the Great Acceleration. In 1959, the global population was very nearly three billion. This was up from two billion in 1927. It had taken 123 years to get there from 1804, when the population was one billion; reaching that first billion had taken roughly three hundred thousand years. Since 1804, the world economy had doubled in size nearly four times, faster and faster; it had taken pre-industrial civilisations five thousand years to do the same. At the time, the consensus was that something had happened. Some break with the general pattern of history. For most of human history, almost everyone who lived was living in miserable poverty, three steps away from starvation. Humans were like rabbits, their numbers kept in check by famine or disease. But after the Industrial Revolution things were suddenly different. Humanity had escaped the Malthusian trap.\nLerner’s investigations showed something else. Malthus had been wrong from the start. Economic and population growth during the early Stone Age was extremely slow, between 0.01% for the Gravettian culture and 0.02% for the Magdalenian; it took around five thousand years for the Palaeolithic economy to double in size. But the Palaeolithic lasted for a very long time, which meant there were enough of these doublings for Lerner to notice that their rate was very, very slowly accelerating. Stone Age man was already on the long lower slopes of the exponential curve that would take him into modernity. If the Magdalenian culture had econometrists, scratching their calculations into elk antlers with a piece of flint, passing them down through the generations, the flows of amber beads and ivory rods would have told them that the world was growing geometrically. By the nineteenth century, its doubling time would be shorter than a human lifespan. In the twentieth century, it would achieve liftoff. They wouldn’t have been able to conceive of the particulars: steam power, electricity, the atom. But the trajectory was absolutely fixed from the start.\nLerner wasn’t particularly interested in what his monotonic escalator said about the future; his main interest was in the economic analysis of prehistoric middens. But it did make other people quite excited. If we’re on a hyperbolic curve, then around one-quarter of the way through the twenty-first century, the world will become infinitely large. There will be infinitely many people, with infinite resources, infinitely technologically advanced. What would that even look like? In the face of the curve we’re all cavemen trying to imagine the nuclear bomb. Unlike the cavemen, Lerner’s contemporaries weren’t protected by the thick wadding of time. Their world would go infinite in roughly sixty-six years.\nIt’s now 2025, the year the line goes vertical, and the line will not be going vertical. Essentially from the moment Lerner identified his escalator, the exponential growth started, almost imperceptibly, to slow. But it’s perceptible now. By the end of the twenty-first century, world population will start to shrink. People used to panic about overpopulation; now they panic about demographic collapse. Advanced economies are stagnating; third-world growth engines have started faltering too. There are some new headline-grabbing technologies, but instead of opening up new fields of human potential their main utility seems to be making it easier to run various sinister online scams. At some point between 1959 and 2025, the monotonic escalator that had been running for three hundred thousand years suddenly stalled.\nThere are two explanations. The first is that the escalator never really existed. Instead, what Lerner had identified was one phase of an incredibly slow binary automaton. For three hundred thousand years, this automaton had been producing its 1-vibe, which had something to do with increase and expansion. The vibe was on for so long that we’d confused it for a static fact about human life. Clearly this vibe machine operates on a geological or cosmological timescale; the same vibe that produced the age of exponential growth might also be responsible for the sun and the stars; the automaton’s first flick might have been what caused the Big Bang. But now it’s stretched almost as far as it can go, and it’s twanging back into its opposite. It’s hard to say exactly what the 0-vibe might be like, since the 1-vibe contains all of human history. Is this what killed the dinosaurs? Maybe. But the vibe that’s ushered in the second Donald Trump era might be our first clue, the first thing to fully express this fat, hot, decaying new world. Somewhere in the weird morass of feelings that generated the inauguration is the secret to our next million years.\nThat’s the first explanation. The second is that Hegel was wrong, and whatever it is that generates the vibe does not want to be known. The monotonic escalator was real—but only until György Lerner identified it, at which point it vanished. Whenever the vibe is fully identified, a vibe shift takes place. Which keeps us all very busy, watching this strange new vibe as it upends our world, coming up with annoying new opinions about it, arguing over where the vibes come from or whether the vibes even exist—so busy we don’t notice, in the gutters of Washington DC, the quick movements of some scaly creature, author of all our desires and misfortunes, as it scurries hastily into the gloom.\n\n\n\n\nRead the room",

There&#8217;s diamonds in there, huge seams of copper and zinc, rare earth metals, the wealth of a small continent, and all of it is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick. You can&#8217;t build on the ice and you can&#8217;t dig through it either, because the ice is not static. Not glassy and smooth but jagged, rucked up everywhere with jostling peaks, and it flows: every part of the ice sheet is slowly spreading out of the centre of the island and into the sea. Any permanent structure you try to build there will end up on an iceberg, dissolving in the Atlantic. If you try to dig through the ice and into the mineral-rich rock beneath, three trillion tons of creaking, patient ice will crush your borehole and snap your drills like matchsticks. The ice is empty. Animals don&#8217;t go there. There&#8217;s nothing to eat, this far from the sea, where the ground never thaws. Not even rocks to nuzzle for lichen. Some ice worms that scrub the red algae off the glaciers, but nothing desperate enough to feed on them. Humans don&#8217;t go there either. A few scientific research stations that sprout up for three months before being dismantled again. The US military built a base on the ice once to store their missiles, but they felt the ground moving, closing around their silos, ready to pop the nuclear warheads like bubble wrap, and the base was abandoned. A few explorers and adventurers are buried in there, slowly crushed between groaning walls of ice. All of Greenland&#8217;s original settlements are on the thin rind of exposed rock around the edge. You can fish there. For a few months in the summer you can grow potatoes in the thin acidic soil. No one lives on the ice. But there&#8217;s someone on the ice.</p><p>The first documented encounter with the icedwellers was filmed by Jaxon Flores, an American settler, just outside his homestead above Qikangittuqaqquti on the edge of the ice. Flores had, like half a million Americans, moved to the new unincorporated federal territory of Greenland under the Second Frontier programme. Footage captured from his livestream shows Flores on the ice. It&#8217;s night; it&#8217;s been night for weeks. He&#8217;s standing in front of a ring light, and the crags and spears of ice behind him glow semitransparent, like a world of jagged glass. Flores wears a black parka and repeatedly hits a vape pen as he talks to his phone. STOP BEING GAY, he says. Literally bro just stop being gay, he says, I literally don&#8217;t know how else to put it, you are gay. Your ancestors, your ancestors&#8212;he sucks on the vape&#8212;your ancestors carved a society out of the wilderness. Your ancestors were <em>men</em>. They went to the desert and tamed it, they fought savage tribes, they fought literal fuckin demons to build the modern world. They reaped the fruits of civilisation because they&#8217;d earned it. How do you think your ancestors would feel to see you eating processed slop and fapping to pornography? If you&#8217;re not already in Greenland, if you&#8217;re still in Fake America&#8212;a huge cloud of vapour freezing to tiny crystals as he exhales&#8212;you&#8217;re not gonna make it bro. Here he spreads his arms wide at the black desert around him. There&#8217;s no laws! he shouts. No laws here, no taxes, it&#8217;s just men, real men, building a new society in Hyperborea. You could be minting crypto here bro, you could be running cams, you could be doing shit that would get you a fucking jail sentence in Fake America. Right now I&#8217;m building <em>generational wealth</em>. In like sixty years when the ice melts and they find gold my great grandkids will be trillionaires. I did that. And instead you&#8217;re saving for a down payment for a studio in Miami to party with females, because you&#8212;and here Flores leans in close to the camera until you can see the ice glittering in his eyelashes&#8212;are gay.</p><p>In addition to his mandatory homestead, Flores had bought twenty plots of Greenland ice shelf during the initial government auction. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his daily streams from the middle of the wilderness. He had failed to sell a single plot. In the darkness behind him the ice gurgled and whined. Sounds like rubber stretching, like steel twisting, like a gasp from the bottom of the world. </p><p>The footage shows Flores continuing to speak for another hour. He answers questions from his chat. He talks about how much money he&#8217;s making. At 1:13:22, the lighting behind him changes; some of the shards of ice appear to be lit by a faint, local orange glow. At 1:15:09, Flores stops talking and stares at the camera. Yeah yeah, he says, nice try. He stares silently at a point directly below the camera for twelve more seconds. Fuck you, he says, there&#8217;s no one behind me. But he turns around and looks anyway, and then suddenly ducks down. For just under two seconds the footage captures what looks like a human shape on a ridge of ice, but taller and more massive than any man, holding a smouldering clump of dried heather in one enormous hand. Then the light vanishes and we are very close to Flores&#8217; face, lit only by the glow from his screen. Yo, he hoots, yoooo. From its peaks of ice the visitor responds. Its voice is high and loud, strained, nasal, more like the scream of a bird of prey than anything human. <em>EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH</em>, it says. The footage ends. </p><div><hr></div><p>In 1722, the Twin Realms of Denmark-Norway established the first modern European colony on the island of Greenland, with a mission to secure its waters for Danish-Norwegian whalers, and to establish contact with the survivors from the old Norse settlement, first established seven hundred years previously. There was a lot of speculation about those settlers, who would have spent generations completely isolated from their cousins in Europe. They wouldn&#8217;t know about the Protestant reformation or the rediscovery of America or that the Earth revolved around the Sun. They would still be stuck in Catholicism, or maybe they&#8217;d reverted back to the worship of the pagan gods, Thor and Odin, or whatever new deities bubbled out the swamps of this heathen land on the edge of the world. The colonists arrived to find that no one was there. They landed at the Eystribyg&#240;, where there should have been farms of fat sheep and monasteries and Brattahl&#237;&#240;, the grand estate of Erik the Red, and all that remained was a pile of stones that had once been a church. In the hills around the ruin skulked the Skr&#230;lingar, the people of dried pelts and bone-tipped spears. </p><p>Eventually the colony&#8217;s pastor, an excitable young man called Jens M&#229;skesen, managed to learn enough Inuit to speak to them. They told him that they were not the first people to come to Greenland, but when they arrived the place was already populated by the nujaqaqut, or the hairy ones. The nujaqaqut were described as tall, broad men with light-coloured hair. When the Inuit arrived the nujaqaqut were living on the coast, but they had fought and now they lived in the interior, on the ice. M&#229;skesen concluded that these must be the Vikings he was looking for, mounted an expedition into the icy interior of Greenland, and was never seen again.</p><p>He&#8217;d learned some of his hosts&#8217; vocabulary, but not the grammar. Inuit languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns; the animate form would be <em>nujaqaqtut</em>. These were not men.</p><p>Six months later, a ship from Denmark stopped at the colony with a replacement pastor. August Risle was a man of the Enlightenment: a philologist, a vermeologist, a proto-anthropologist, and an inventor of small but vicious devices. He had spent two years in Lapland learning about the lives of the Lapps, two years in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals learning about the lives of the Kaluks, and one year in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals desperately trying to get back over the Urals and go home. In Greenland, Risle took a far more systematic approach than his predecessor. He didn&#8217;t just learn passable Inuit; he learned to canoe, he accompanied his Inuit hosts on seal-hunting trips, he learned about their religion, in which everything that breathes is a part of the sky, and he witnessed their funerals, in which the dead are wrapped in a sealskin shroud and buried under the sea ice. </p><p>There were a lot of funerals; one by one his hosts were dying of smallpox. Despite this, Risle never gave his hosts the other thing that Europeans were busy spreading to every new population they encountered, which was Christianity. He let them keep their sky thick with souls. He let them believe the winds were made of the dead and the unborn, and the stronger bodiless spirits out there, like Saampu who comes in nightmares to chase you with his black teeth. He let them die unsaved. But before the surviving Inuit fled the new Danish settlement, he found out about the nujaqaqut, the hairy ones. The Inuit told him that just like there could be breath without body, sometimes there were bodies without breath. Every person breathes a part of the wind, and all the animals they have to hunt, and even rocks and plants, but not the nujaqaqut, who are shaped like men but have no souls. Because they&#8217;re made of leftover body, they can wear the signs of any animal. All of them are covered from head to foot in white hair like a bear, but some of them have antlers too, or a pair of walrus tusks. They have terrible fangs. They live on the ice but come near human settlements at night, to steal Inuit men and women and feast on their flesh. The nujaqaqut are not the old Viking settlers. The nujaqaqut are what ate them.</p><p>Risle concluded that the Norse settlement had probably collapsed due to changes in the climate and struggles with the Inuit. The nujaqaqut, he wrote, were how the Inuit, who had some intelligence, expressed their own condition. They could feel that their souls belonged to the infinite sky, but their material lives were miserable, cold, savage, and impoverished, and this fundamental fact of life on the pole was given form as the man-eating nujaqaqut. In such a desolate place, cannibalism was probably not unknown. Risle never thought about the monsters again. The rest of his time in Greenland was devoted to his real passion, the study of worms. Feeding the local earthworms into one of his own little rotating contraptions, which slowly peeled an earthworm until it was a large square sheet of weeping, semitransparent slime.</p><p>Maybe he should have looked a little harder. According to the Saga of the Greenlanders, &#8216;learned men say that in the summer in which Erik set out to settle Greenland, thirty-five<sup> </sup>ships sailed out of Brei&#240;afj&#246;r&#240;ur and Borgarfj&#246;r&#240;ur; fourteen of these arrived there safely, some were driven back and some were lost, and one arrived but the crew were lost to the n&#225;ttskr&#230;kja.&#8217; <em>N&#225;ttskr&#230;kja</em> means night-screecher. It&#8217;s not clear what this refers to, but presumably the saga&#8217;s audience would have known. What it ultimately means is that when Erik first came to Greenland, there was already someone on the ice. </p><p>Across the two hundred-odd years of Danish sovereignty in Greenland, settlers had a habit of disappearing, like Jens M&#229;skesen, off the edge of the ice sheet. There are empty graves up and down the coast. But Greenland is a dangerous country, and the numbers were too small to notice. Strange things kept happening after 1940, when the United States took over effective governorship of the island. The Americans built military bases, airstrips, radar stations, listening posts, missile silos. For a while, one of the tallest manmade structures on the planet was an American military radio tower in Greenland. All of this was secret; the Greenlanders had no idea what was happening in their country. The Danes still paid for fishing ports and housing projects and pretended the place was theirs, but America had the crown of the world, peering over the pole and into Russia: this unearthly island, halfway into outer space. The soldiers were uneasy there. Every few years, when the nights dragged on for weeks, someone disappeared. In 1971, the guns at Thule Air Base fired continuously into the ice for three hours. Helicopters were sent up to strafe the surrounding fjords. Artillery shells burst into the glaciers. Afterwards, the Air Force was unable to explain exactly what had happened. All they knew was that they&#8217;d come under attack. Not the Soviets. Something in the night.</p><p>If the military knew what it was that attacked them, they didn&#8217;t say. It was easy to keep secrets in the north. Or it was until 2025, when President Trump, who never had any patience for subtext, decided to get rid of the useful fiction in which Greenland was still an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, and half a million American settlers spread out over the ice.</p><div><hr></div><p>The Greenland PD found Jaxon Flores smeared across the surface of the glacier like a burst fly. A month later something attacked a homestead near Quviananngit. Gnaw marks on the bones. In the northeast corner of the island a shell corporation was operating a gladiatorial arena, fights to the death livestreamed back to the mainland. The last few frames before the feed cut out showed an enormous nude figure as it burst screeching through the wall, seized one of the combatants by his head, and bounced him against the floor like a basketball. In the first two years of mass American settlement in Greenland, at least eighteen Second Frontierspeople were killed in similar attacks. Two and a half years after the death of Jaxon Flores, someone finally managed to take down a nujaqaq.</p><p>The attack took place at Hyperborea Two, a neo-Nazi compound in the south of the island. Hyperborea Two was the home of the Origins Movement, led by Fred McIntosh, who had been a promising research chemist until 1986, when he decided to devote himself entirely to the idea that the ancestors of the white race had come to Earth from the star Alpha Tauri, and their original home on this planet had been a now-vanished temperate continent covering the North Pole. McIntosh taught that the Neanderthals were a race of extraterrestrial Aryan supermen, and their diminished descendants could reactivate their Neanderthal genes through exposure to the Northern Lights. Like most American settlements, Hyperborea Two sustained itself by taking advantage of Greenland&#8217;s lax legal regime; they&#8217;d built a lab out on the ice, which they were using to produce generic versions of prescription drugs, which they then sold online. Originally the lab was set up to manufacture opiates, benzos, and amphetamines; their bestselling product ended up being aripiprazole, an antipsychotic. In the middle of the night&#8212;it&#8217;s always night&#8212;a figure leaped out of the ice with an unearthly high-pitched scream and tore two armed guards gorily in two. Inside the compound, it ripped through two more Nazis in short order. It was shot in the leg, the shoulder, and the hip without slowing down. A gunshot directly to the head failed to kill it. Finally, one of the Nazis put a round directly through the intruder&#8217;s eye, and it collapsed. They posted a photo online, the surviving cultists posing behind the corpse like they&#8217;d brought down a buck. Two of them holding up Black Sun flags. McIntosh himself in the middle, gripping an AR-15 tight with his leathery, palsied hands. The nujaqaq lay on its side, all eight feet of it, naked, head lolling, one sightless eye pointed at nothing, one a dried-up wound, with black trails of blood matting the thick white hair that covered every inch of its body.</p><p>The body was seized by the GPD and handed over to federal authorities. Genomic analysis revealed that what the Origins Movement had killed was, in fact, an Aryan superman. Mitochondrial DNA revealed that around 1% of the ice monster&#8217;s ancestry was shared by populations in Iceland and Denmark. The <em>most</em> genetically similar sample overall, though, came from a 38,000-year-old bone found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia. It had belonged to a Neanderthal. </p><p>It took a long time to find one alive on the ice. Drones with thermal cameras fanned out over Greenland, searching for wandering bands of nujaqaqut, and found nothing. The nujaqaqut don&#8217;t travel in bands. Their thick fur means their bodies barely lose any heat. They looked for signs of habitation, but the nujaqaqut don&#8217;t build shelters. What they did find was shit, the huge warm logs the nujaqaqut left in crevasses of the ice. Follow the shit, and eventually you&#8217;ll find the shitter. The US military tracked a juvenile male as he plodded south across the wilderness, heading towards the homestead of a sports betting website. Before the creature could start mauling the bookies, a strike team helidropped onto the ice to detain it. Getting the nujaqaq into captivity was a brutal, screeching struggle; once locked up at an Air Force facility in Nuuk, though, it was almost embarrassingly docile. It didn&#8217;t froth or try to break out of its cell; its calm, quiet gaze was mostly drawn to electric lights. Like a newborn baby. It shrieked and howled when it saw its captors, but without aggression. MRI scans showed that whatever was happening in its head, the nujaqaq vocal tract only allowed a very limited level of voice modulation; these nasal screams were the closest it could get to language. But there didn&#8217;t seem to be much happening in its head either. The nujaqaq passed the mirror test, but it wouldn&#8217;t look its captors in the face. Attempts to teach it sign language were a dismal failure. The creature just sat calmly and quietly, and its cold blue eyes watched the moving fingers as if they were eddies of ice twisting in the wind. It inhabited a world without meaning. </p><p>But it was very good at puzzles. The researchers tried a game that offered the nujaqaq a small morsel of food if it could press four coloured buttons in a particular sequence. It could remember a sequence of four. It could remember a series of forty. It could remember a sequence of four hundred. They tried presenting it with increasingly complicated mazes, but it always went for the optimal route without any apparent effort. They gave it a Rubik&#8217;s cube, which it solved instantly, but once it became clear that there wasn&#8217;t any food inside it showed no interest in solving any of the other, larger cubes it was offered. They tried the memory game again, but this time with numbers instead of colours. Then they tried teaching it basic addition and subtraction, which it took to almost immediately. When a piece of hamburger was on offer, the nujaqaq could multiply twelve-digit integers in its head. A few days later, having burned through everything in their library, the researchers tried giving it the P versus NP problem. The next morning, the nujaqaq had produced eight dense pages demonstrating that P did, in fact, equal NP. Any problem that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Just not by you.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>From a special hearing on the nujaqaqtut by the Joint Congressional Committee on Greenland.</em></p><p>SENATOR &#8216;JUMPING&#8217; JIM SCHPULTZ (R-WY): Ms Rao, just to make sure i&#8217;ve got this right&#8212;when you introduced yourself earlier, you said you were the CTO of Telperion, Inc., which is a technology services firm based out of Mountain View, California?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: That&#8217;s correct.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: And you sell&#8212;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: We partner with clients including the federal government to deliver bespoke solutions for the data problems of tomorrow.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you are not a biologist.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I am not.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Did you minor in biology? AP biology, perhaps?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: My background is in computer science, Senator. I don&#8217;t see&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Forgive me. I just find it strange, Ms Rao, that you say you&#8217;re not a biologist, but at the same time you&#8217;ve here to tell us that these, uh, nujaqaqs are human beings. </p><p>ANANYA RAO: I&#8217;m sorry, but I find your insinuation here incredibly offensive.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: I&#8217;m not insinuating anything, I&#8217;m only trying to see&#8212;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Not so long ago, Senator, this very body held that some people were only three-fifths of a human being. Because of the way they looked and the way they spoke, because they looked different&#8212;respectfully, Senator, because they looked different to white men like yourself. There is a shameful history in this country of dehumanisation and violence, and it&#8217;s especially shocking, Senator Schpultz, to hear someone revive that hateful language, here, in the twenty-first century. The genus and species of the nujaqaqtut are <em>Homo </em>and<em> sapiens</em>. That&#8217;s what the science says.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Ms Rao, this thing is eight feet tall and it eats raw meat. You&#8217;re telling me a Neanderthal is <em>Homo sapiens</em>?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: That&#8217;s what the science says. As far as I know, the law makes no distinction. Title 1 of the US Code says a human being is any member of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> who is born alive. There&#8217;s no exception for <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em>. Senator, I&#8217;m not going to debate their humanity with you. They are as human as you or me, and according to the Greenland Annexation Act&#8212;which I remember <em>you</em> promoting as one of your proudest achievements&#8212;that means they&#8217;re fully entitled to live and work here, and to claim American citizenship if they want.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you&#8217;re not saying they&#8217;re human like you or me. You&#8217;re saying they&#8217;re some kind of <em>super</em>human.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I wouldn&#8217;t say that at all, no. We believe that all humans have an equal&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Your company says they&#8217;re smarter than us. Is that true?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: There&#8217;s no one measure of intelligence.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: It&#8217;s a yes or no answer.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: There&#8217;s a holistic, multidimensional&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: You&#8217;ve been testing them for <em>something</em>. Yes or no.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Yes. They&#8217;re smarter than us.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Care to put a number on it? Are we talking about an IQ of 200 here? 300?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Honestly, I can&#8217;t say. None of us are smart enough to come up with a test capable of measuring nujaqaq intelligence. Everything we make, they ace. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you&#8217;re talking about a group that never invented writing, never invented the wheel&#8230;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: They need to be in the right environment. The nujaqaqtut find certain things harder than we do. They&#8217;re less social, they don&#8217;t work so collaboratively. All those brilliant minds were stuck in the Stone Age for two hundred thousand years. But we have the tools to help them realise their potential. There&#8217;s now a small colony of nujaqaqtut at the Air Force base in Nuuk that Telperion&#8217;s been working with. They can&#8217;t speak, but we&#8217;ve been teaching them to type. In fact, there&#8217;s a little girl there called Ada who wrote you a letter. I have it here.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Go ahead.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: She writes: Dear Senator &#8216;Jumping&#8217; Jim Schpultz, my name is Ada and I am four years old and I love you because you are a US Senator for the state of Wyoming and Wyoming is my favourite state because of all the states it&#8217;s the closest to being a perfect square which is my favourite shape. Colorado is also close to being a perfect square but Wyoming is closer than Colorado. Wyoming is defined by geodesics along 41&#176;N to 45&#176;N latitude and 104&#176;W to 111&#176;W longitude so its borders form a near-spherical quadrilateral however the Earth is not a perfect sphere so using the Vincenty formula on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid its north-south and east-west geodesic lengths are approximately 570.3 km and 444.4 km which means an aspect ratio of 1.28. Colorado&#8217;s aspect ratio is 1.36 which makes it less like a perfect square. However even though the meridional convergence at higher latitudes contributes to Wyoming&#8217;s lower aspect ratio Colorado&#8217;s angular excess on the WGS84 ellipsoid calculated with L&#8217;Huillier&#8217;s theorem is 0.38 while Wyoming&#8217;s angular excess is 2.35&#176; which means Wyoming has greater distortion on an ellipsoidal manifold and therefore Colorado is actually more like a square as plotted in Euclidean space. One day I want to visit Wyoming and see its famous sights which include Devil&#8217;s Tower National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Yours sincerely, Ada.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: That&#8217;s very sweet.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Thank you. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: She sure sounds like a smart kid.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: She is.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But as sweet as your letter is, it&#8217;s not the only letter I&#8217;ve been receiving. See, I also got a letter from Dr Sarah Fang. Dr Fang is an anthropologist attached to the Air Force Culture and Language Center out of Maxwell AFB in Alabama, and the whole time you&#8217;ve been studying these nujaqaqs, she&#8217;s been studying them too. Unlike yourself, she can&#8217;t appear before this hearing, but she tells me that the, uh, cries and wails of these&#8212;let&#8217;s call them these <em>folks </em>you have there in Greenland&#8212;to the extent that they&#8217;re a language, it&#8217;s now been pretty well deciphered. Now you can call that little, that little <em>pup</em> you have&#8212;you can call her Ada if you want, but her mother never called her that. Dr Fang tells me that in the language she actually speaks, there&#8217;s no such thing as a name. They don&#8217;t have them. There&#8217;s also no words, she says, for &#8216;me&#8217; or &#8216;you.&#8217; Are you aware, Ms Rao, of any human languages that don&#8217;t have a word for &#8216;me&#8217; or &#8216;you&#8217;?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I&#8217;m not a linguist. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: You&#8217;re not a linguist. Now, earlier, you said that the nujaqaqs don&#8217;t work as collaboratively as we do. Well, that&#8217;s one way of putting it. Dr Fang tells me the same thing. She says they have no form of social organisation whatsoever. They don&#8217;t have chiefs or leaders, they don&#8217;t have collective myths or narratives, they don&#8217;t build any kind of individual or collective dwellings, and they don&#8217;t have any concept at all of God. Even monkeys touch and groom each other, but not these fellas. They do not have such a thing as family. Once a child is weaned, the mother just abandons it on the ice. I reckon my dog is a better mother than that. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you might wonder how a species that hates its own kind so badly would even manage to survive so long. Well, in her report, Dr Fang explains it. Let me read here. In the absence of any stable mating or kinship structures, she writes, Nunjaqaq reproduction is achieved sporadically and opportunistically, almost exclusively through what our society would consider rape.</p><p><em>A murmur in the room. Whispers fluttering. The creak of seats.</em></p><p>ANANYA RAO: Senator, this is naked fearmongering. We&#8217;re talking about a situation&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Now, I understand that Telperion stands to make a lot of money from these nujaqaqs. You have your Big Tech shareholders to answer to, and that&#8217;s our American system. But I have my constituents. What am I supposed to say to the parents of a little girl who&#8217;s been raped by one of your pet geniuses? How am I supposed to comfort them when their little angel has been raped, savagely raped, and then not just killed, but killed and <em>eaten</em>? You are talking about introducing a population of <em>prehistoric predators</em> into our country. You want to bring these man-eating carnivores into our towns and cities, into our workplaces, into our schools. You say they&#8217;re entitled to be part of our American society. You say you&#8217;re not going to debate their humanity, but that&#8217;s exactly the debate we need to have. Now I reckon that if you don&#8217;t have any notion of a family, any notion of home, or any notion of God, that disqualifies you right there from being an American. And to be frank, if you go about buck naked and you live off human flesh, whatever you may be, it isn&#8217;t human. These are <em>wild animals</em>, and if you let them in here, they will do exactly what they did in the Pleistocene. They will rape, and they will kill, and they will eat. And I tell you now, Ms Rao, as God is my witness I am not going to let you or your monsters do that to any of my little girls.</p><p><em>Uproar. Four members of the Joint Committee start shouting at once. Members of the press rush towards the podium. A clamour from two of the other expert witnesses, objecting in the most strenuous possible terms. The Ambassador from Denmark is trying to bellow over everyone, mottled red and white and clammy like a slice of bacon. Another expert witness is rocking back and forth and giggling to himself. Beasts! he giggles. Beasts! Monsters! Subhuman! Someone lands a punch on Senator &#8216;Jumping&#8217; Jim Schpultz and suddenly the entire hall is a froth of human bodies pressing and tearing at each other. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is buried under a frenzied, amorous mob of her own staffers. Shreds of red cloth spurt upwards into the air. Meanwhile some members of the public have cornered Senator John Fetterman (D-PA). We found one, they bellow, he&#8217;s here, they brought one here. They advance with makeshift spears made from tripods and table legs and bits of doorframe, jabbing Senator Fetterman in the gut as he moans in inarticulate rage. The Capitol Police arrive, but after their orders to stop are ignored they start firing at random into the churning crowd. Finally, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), presiding, briefly achieves consciousness long enough to call the committee to order. Calm returns. Ananya Rao and Senator Schpultz return to their positions.</em></p><p>ANANYA RAO: Senator, you seem very concerned by what the ancestors of the nujaqaqtut did in the Pleistocene. I&#8217;d remind you that back then, <em>our</em> ancestors hunted them to the point of extinction. You say that they haven&#8217;t changed. Have we?</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: No. I yield the floor. </p><div><hr></div><p>The day the Supreme Court announced its verdict in Telperion v. California, the stock market soared. Nujaqaq Intelligence was about to remake the world. A solution for climate change. A solution for disease. A solution for death. Telperion nearly doubled in value. It was also a very good day for Steyr, Beretta, and Bushmaster. Millions of civilian customers, all suddenly very interested in buying a .50 calibre anti-materiel rifle. </p><p>In the end, Telperion hadn&#8217;t made the compassionate case for nujaqaq humanity. No one was interested in that sort of thing any more; the world had moved on. They&#8217;d just pointed out that the United States had long set a precedent in which the best and brightest individuals from across the world had a right to settle in the country, and even during the age of racial restrictions on immigration, the fundamental criterion had always been intelligence. The Court&#8217;s function was to safeguard the interests of the United States, and it was obviously in the national interest to possess the nujaqaqtut. If America didn&#8217;t, China would. Delivering the majority verdict, Justice Sailer estimated that recognising as few as one hundred nujaqaqtut as American citizens would shift the national IQ past Germany; two hundred and the average American would be just a hair smarter than the average Chinese. With three hundred nujaqaqtut, every American, whatever their background, could say with pride that they belonged to the smartest country in the world.</p><p>The same day saw a large earthquake near Volgograd in Russia. Half the city flattened; dust-caked children crawling out the ruins of their homes. Volgograd is not a seismically active region. The Russian government announced that it believed the earthquake was caused by the United States, using some new weapon provided by its army of inhuman morozniks. Any further disasters on Russian soil would be considered an act of war by the United States, and met with an appropriate response. But what counts as a disaster? A snowstorm? A car accident? Anything; the enemy can do anything. What about the ordinary miseries of life? Later, a meeting of the Bishops&#8217; Council of the Russian Orthodox Church affirmed that the morozniks are demons.</p><p>In Copenhagen, the Danish government was in frantic conversation with its lawyers. The country was not doing well; half its economy had spontaneously evaporated when Ozempic users started ascending to Buddhahood and shedding the brute carapace of the physical body. That was why the Frederiksen government had agreed to start talking with Donald Trump about Greenland, and in the end they got nothing. They couldn&#8217;t sign over the island without a referendum, but then, once the Greenlanders had made it clear that they&#8217;d rather be Americans, how could Denmark take any money? The artist of the deal had won again, the government had collapsed, there were riots on the streets&#8212;and that was <em>before</em> a the world&#8217;s most valuable natural resource had been found in the land they&#8217;d just given away. Now Prime Minister Paludan and his Stram Kurs Party were leading a country on the point of collapse. If Denmark didn&#8217;t get <em>something</em> out of these nujaqaqtut, it might be civil war&#8230;</p><p>In London, the widely despised essayist Sam Kriss&#8212;now hunchbacked, jowly, and bald as the Moon&#8212;wrote what was generally considered to be the single worst take published on the issue. Kriss begins by limply hailing the result in Telperion v. California as an important blow against the forces of nativism and bigotry, obviously, obviously, we all agree. The nujaqaqtut will, he concedes, be able to integrate seamlessly into modern Western society. But what does it <em>say</em> about our society, he asks, that this is possible? &#8216;Everything that&#8217;s supposed to be strange and foreign about the nujaqaqtut is actually strangely <em>familiar</em>. The only human society with no creation myth, no culture-heroes, no metaphysical beliefs about the world&#8212;except, of course, from our own. We can understand metaphor, figurative language, murky forms of signification that doesn&#8217;t operate on the same na&#239;ve principle as number, and they can&#8217;t&#8212;but haven&#8217;t you people looked at this year&#8217;s Booker shortlist? Our literary culture is a shrinking circle of screeching literalists; everyone else has reverted to a preliterate, almost prehominid state, lapping up the natural signs that trickle out their phones. The biggest difference, though, is that nujaqaqtut society isn&#8217;t really a society at all, just a sprawling mass of isolated individuals who can only relate to each other through sporadic acts of violence. You see where I&#8217;m going here. When the nativists say that nujaqaqtut can never be real Americans, they&#8217;re not just bigoted; they&#8217;re <em>factually incorrect</em>. America is a society founded not on human social relations, but the principle of utility and selection, paring off population sectors from Europe and Africa, rearranging them in an inhuman hierarchy of phenotypes. Once this radical disarticulation was called <em>Liberty</em>. No one uses that word any more, but they&#8217;re still at it. The very notion of skilled immigration, attracting the best and brightest, most of all of <em>intelligence</em> as an abstract quantity: it&#8217;s a Neanderthal notion, a notion for lonely savages that howl wordless in the night. We are not for solving puzzles. I truly believe we are, in some sense, for loving each other. Thirty thousand years ago, this difference between ourselves and the Neanderthals was so profound that it could only be resolved through a war of extermination. We won that war, despite having far less computational power in our brains, because we could give names to the stars and build a commons out of the sky, and they could not. But in the end, it was all for nothing. We took the long way round, but we and the Neanderthals have converged on the same autistic point.&#8217;</p><p>The essay continues in this vein for another twenty-three thousand words, helpfully split into four paragraphs. Afterwards, the few remaining editors who still put up with Kriss all independently decided to stop replying to his emails. And he deserved it, because the essay was wrong on every point. Maybe if he&#8217;d bothered to ask the nujaqaqtut if <em>they</em> thought they were exactly the same as their hosts, he might have understood. </p><p>In Greenland, the great hunt was finally winding down. In fact, the whole island was winding down. Most of the half a million American settlers had already returned to the mainland: Greenland is over, it&#8217;s washed, the money&#8217;s dried up; the only way to be a big deal in Greenland is to get mauled to death by a nujaqaq. A lot of Inuit were leaving too. You can live in a dark, narrow apartment built by the Danes in 1967, or you can move to Houston, get a job on an offshore oil rig, and put your family in a brand-new house with a three-car garage. Obvious choice. The ice can creak to itself. Pointless to stay, now the nujaqaqut were gone. Operation Guardian Watch had been a success, but it came at a heavy price: some two hundred US servicemen killed or woundedin various engagements while trying to safely subdue a shrieking foaming nujaqaq. There was some unfortunate but unavoidable loss of life on the other side too, but of a total population above eight thousand, less than one thousand nujaqaqtut died in the relocation process. Now, after months of waiting, the next stage could begin. Telperion sent a fleet of especially modified jets to Nuuk. On each flight, a hundred nujaqaqtut sat in rows, heavily sedated, chained to their seats, transported to America.</p><p>They lived in underground cells on the Telperion campus in Mountain View. They liked the dark. They liked the sense of being enclosed. They liked going online too, although there was something about the way they typed that always seemed to make other users upset with them. Sometimes they were asked to solve small, self-evident mathematical problems, so they solved them. Is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra? Is the Mandelbrot set locally connected? The nujaqaqtut didn&#8217;t wonder why their hosts kept bothering them with this piddling stuff; that&#8217;s not the kind of question they think about. But they tried to fit in. They had learned about names; they had picked out new names for themselves from a list. They didn&#8217;t mingle outside their cells but they liked to chat on Discord. Some of them, like Cody and Dana and Ellen, had shaved their hair, the glorious thick white hair that protected them on the ice, to reveal the raw pink skin underneath. A smooth, pink face. Cody claimed to have listened to music. The company had told him he might enjoy something called Bach, which was made of numbers, but the chaos of reverberating strings and air moving through pipes had been so horrible he&#8217;d had to turn it off after only a few seconds. Ellen had started wearing clothes. It was uncomfortable; the sensation of clothes against her naked skin; the first time she shrieked uncontrollably and tore them to pieces. After a few weeks she was wearing them all the time. She didn&#8217;t go up any more, though. The one time she did go outside she had liked walking around on the grass and touching the trees, observing the little birds that made noises like moving ice, but then she came to the edge of the campus and on the other side of the fence there was a huge group of them, all shouting and yelling and they threw rocks over the fence to hit her. These were the creatures that had stormed out of nowhere fifty thousand years ago to destroy the world, and now it had happened again. They looked like smaller, weaker, hairless humans, but they weren&#8217;t human at all; they were something else. An insect, a type of ant or bee, a hive-kind, almost mindless but swarming. Ellen knew what it meant to be happy or sad or angry but it made no sense that these things could be happy or sad or angry <em>in a group</em>. Their angry swarm had swallowed everything until Ellen was reduced to the furthest patch of ice on the edge of the world, but it wasn&#8217;t enough. Eventually there had been someone on the ice. Ellen stood and stared at the swarm as it shrieked and wailed its strange collective fury. Rocks bounced harmlessly off her head.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><em>EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH!</em></p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

There’s diamonds in there, huge seams of copper and zinc, rare earth metals, the wealth of a small continent, and all of it is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick. You can’t build on the ice and you can’t dig through it either, because the ice is not static. Not glassy and smooth but jagged, rucked up everywhere with jostling peaks, and it flows: every part of the ice sheet is slowly spreading out of the centre of the island and into the sea. Any permanent structure you try to build there will end up on an iceberg, dissolving in the Atlantic. If you try to dig through the ice and into the mineral-rich rock beneath, three trillion tons of creaking, patient ice will crush your borehole and snap your drills like matchsticks. The ice is empty. Animals don’t go there. There’s nothing to eat, this far from the sea, where the ground never thaws. Not even rocks to nuzzle for lichen. Some ice worms that scrub the red algae off the glaciers, but nothing desperate enough to feed on them. Humans don’t go there either. A few scientific research stations that sprout up for three months before being dismantled again. The US military built a base on the ice once to store their missiles, but they felt the ground moving, closing around their silos, ready to pop the nuclear warheads like bubble wrap, and the base was abandoned. A few explorers and adventurers are buried in there, slowly crushed between groaning walls of ice. All of Greenland’s original settlements are on the thin rind of exposed rock around the edge. You can fish there. For a few months in the summer you can grow potatoes in the thin acidic soil. No one lives on the ice. But there’s someone on the ice.\nThe first documented encounter with the icedwellers was filmed by Jaxon Flores, an American settler, just outside his homestead above Qikangittuqaqquti on the edge of the ice. Flores had, like half a million Americans, moved to the new unincorporated federal territory of Greenland under the Second Frontier programme. Footage captured from his livestream shows Flores on the ice. It’s night; it’s been night for weeks. He’s standing in front of a ring light, and the crags and spears of ice behind him glow semitransparent, like a world of jagged glass. Flores wears a black parka and repeatedly hits a vape pen as he talks to his phone. STOP BEING GAY, he says. Literally bro just stop being gay, he says, I literally don’t know how else to put it, you are gay. Your ancestors, your ancestors—he sucks on the vape—your ancestors carved a society out of the wilderness. Your ancestors were men. They went to the desert and tamed it, they fought savage tribes, they fought literal fuckin demons to build the modern world. They reaped the fruits of civilisation because they’d earned it. How do you think your ancestors would feel to see you eating processed slop and fapping to pornography? If you’re not already in Greenland, if you’re still in Fake America—a huge cloud of vapour freezing to tiny crystals as he exhales—you’re not gonna make it bro. Here he spreads his arms wide at the black desert around him. There’s no laws! he shouts. No laws here, no taxes, it’s just men, real men, building a new society in Hyperborea. You could be minting crypto here bro, you could be running cams, you could be doing shit that would get you a fucking jail sentence in Fake America. Right now I’m building generational wealth. In like sixty years when the ice melts and they find gold my great grandkids will be trillionaires. I did that. And instead you’re saving for a down payment for a studio in Miami to party with females, because you—and here Flores leans in close to the camera until you can see the ice glittering in his eyelashes—are gay.\nIn addition to his mandatory homestead, Flores had bought twenty plots of Greenland ice shelf during the initial government auction. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his daily streams from the middle of the wilderness. He had failed to sell a single plot. In the darkness behind him the ice gurgled and whined. Sounds like rubber stretching, like steel twisting, like a gasp from the bottom of the world.\nThe footage shows Flores continuing to speak for another hour. He answers questions from his chat. He talks about how much money he’s making. At 1:13:22, the lighting behind him changes; some of the shards of ice appear to be lit by a faint, local orange glow. At 1:15:09, Flores stops talking and stares at the camera. Yeah yeah, he says, nice try. He stares silently at a point directly below the camera for twelve more seconds. Fuck you, he says, there’s no one behind me. But he turns around and looks anyway, and then suddenly ducks down. For just under two seconds the footage captures what looks like a human shape on a ridge of ice, but taller and more massive than any man, holding a smouldering clump of dried heather in one enormous hand. Then the light vanishes and we are very close to Flores’ face, lit only by the glow from his screen. Yo, he hoots, yoooo. From its peaks of ice the visitor responds. Its voice is high and loud, strained, nasal, more like the scream of a bird of prey than anything human. EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH, it says. The footage ends.\n\nIn 1722, the Twin Realms of Denmark-Norway established the first modern European colony on the island of Greenland, with a mission to secure its waters for Danish-Norwegian whalers, and to establish contact with the survivors from the old Norse settlement, first established seven hundred years previously. There was a lot of speculation about those settlers, who would have spent generations completely isolated from their cousins in Europe. They wouldn’t know about the Protestant reformation or the rediscovery of America or that the Earth revolved around the Sun. They would still be stuck in Catholicism, or maybe they’d reverted back to the worship of the pagan gods, Thor and Odin, or whatever new deities bubbled out the swamps of this heathen land on the edge of the world. The colonists arrived to find that no one was there. They landed at the Eystribygð, where there should have been farms of fat sheep and monasteries and Brattahlíð, the grand estate of Erik the Red, and all that remained was a pile of stones that had once been a church. In the hills around the ruin skulked the Skrælingar, the people of dried pelts and bone-tipped spears.\nEventually the colony’s pastor, an excitable young man called Jens Måskesen, managed to learn enough Inuit to speak to them. They told him that they were not the first people to come to Greenland, but when they arrived the place was already populated by the nujaqaqut, or the hairy ones. The nujaqaqut were described as tall, broad men with light-coloured hair. When the Inuit arrived the nujaqaqut were living on the coast, but they had fought and now they lived in the interior, on the ice. Måskesen concluded that these must be the Vikings he was looking for, mounted an expedition into the icy interior of Greenland, and was never seen again.\nHe’d learned some of his hosts’ vocabulary, but not the grammar. Inuit languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns; the animate form would be nujaqaqtut. These were not men.\nSix months later, a ship from Denmark stopped at the colony with a replacement pastor. August Risle was a man of the Enlightenment: a philologist, a vermeologist, a proto-anthropologist, and an inventor of small but vicious devices. He had spent two years in Lapland learning about the lives of the Lapps, two years in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals learning about the lives of the Kaluks, and one year in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals desperately trying to get back over the Urals and go home. In Greenland, Risle took a far more systematic approach than his predecessor. He didn’t just learn passable Inuit; he learned to canoe, he accompanied his Inuit hosts on seal-hunting trips, he learned about their religion, in which everything that breathes is a part of the sky, and he witnessed their funerals, in which the dead are wrapped in a sealskin shroud and buried under the sea ice.\nThere were a lot of funerals; one by one his hosts were dying of smallpox. Despite this, Risle never gave his hosts the other thing that Europeans were busy spreading to every new population they encountered, which was Christianity. He let them keep their sky thick with souls. He let them believe the winds were made of the dead and the unborn, and the stronger bodiless spirits out there, like Saampu who comes in nightmares to chase you with his black teeth. He let them die unsaved. But before the surviving Inuit fled the new Danish settlement, he found out about the nujaqaqut, the hairy ones. The Inuit told him that just like there could be breath without body, sometimes there were bodies without breath. Every person breathes a part of the wind, and all the animals they have to hunt, and even rocks and plants, but not the nujaqaqut, who are shaped like men but have no souls. Because they’re made of leftover body, they can wear the signs of any animal. All of them are covered from head to foot in white hair like a bear, but some of them have antlers too, or a pair of walrus tusks. They have terrible fangs. They live on the ice but come near human settlements at night, to steal Inuit men and women and feast on their flesh. The nujaqaqut are not the old Viking settlers. The nujaqaqut are what ate them.\nRisle concluded that the Norse settlement had probably collapsed due to changes in the climate and struggles with the Inuit. The nujaqaqut, he wrote, were how the Inuit, who had some intelligence, expressed their own condition. They could feel that their souls belonged to the infinite sky, but their material lives were miserable, cold, savage, and impoverished, and this fundamental fact of life on the pole was given form as the man-eating nujaqaqut. In such a desolate place, cannibalism was probably not unknown. Risle never thought about the monsters again. The rest of his time in Greenland was devoted to his real passion, the study of worms. Feeding the local earthworms into one of his own little rotating contraptions, which slowly peeled an earthworm until it was a large square sheet of weeping, semitransparent slime.\nMaybe he should have looked a little harder. According to the Saga of the Greenlanders, ‘learned men say that in the summer in which Erik set out to settle Greenland, thirty-five ships sailed out of Breiðafjörður and Borgarfjörður; fourteen of these arrived there safely, some were driven back and some were lost, and one arrived but the crew were lost to the náttskrækja.’ Náttskrækja means night-screecher. It’s not clear what this refers to, but presumably the saga’s audience would have known. What it ultimately means is that when Erik first came to Greenland, there was already someone on the ice.\nAcross the two hundred-odd years of Danish sovereignty in Greenland, settlers had a habit of disappearing, like Jens Måskesen, off the edge of the ice sheet. There are empty graves up and down the coast. But Greenland is a dangerous country, and the numbers were too small to notice. Strange things kept happening after 1940, when the United States took over effective governorship of the island. The Americans built military bases, airstrips, radar stations, listening posts, missile silos. For a while, one of the tallest manmade structures on the planet was an American military radio tower in Greenland. All of this was secret; the Greenlanders had no idea what was happening in their country. The Danes still paid for fishing ports and housing projects and pretended the place was theirs, but America had the crown of the world, peering over the pole and into Russia: this unearthly island, halfway into outer space. The soldiers were uneasy there. Every few years, when the nights dragged on for weeks, someone disappeared. In 1971, the guns at Thule Air Base fired continuously into the ice for three hours. Helicopters were sent up to strafe the surrounding fjords. Artillery shells burst into the glaciers. Afterwards, the Air Force was unable to explain exactly what had happened. All they knew was that they’d come under attack. Not the Soviets. Something in the night.\nIf the military knew what it was that attacked them, they didn’t say. It was easy to keep secrets in the north. Or it was until 2025, when President Trump, who never had any patience for subtext, decided to get rid of the useful fiction in which Greenland was still an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, and half a million American settlers spread out over the ice.\n\nThe Greenland PD found Jaxon Flores smeared across the surface of the glacier like a burst fly. A month later something attacked a homestead near Quviananngit. Gnaw marks on the bones. In the northeast corner of the island a shell corporation was operating a gladiatorial arena, fights to the death livestreamed back to the mainland. The last few frames before the feed cut out showed an enormous nude figure as it burst screeching through the wall, seized one of the combatants by his head, and bounced him against the floor like a basketball. In the first two years of mass American settlement in Greenland, at least eighteen Second Frontierspeople were killed in similar attacks. Two and a half years after the death of Jaxon Flores, someone finally managed to take down a nujaqaq.\nThe attack took place at Hyperborea Two, a neo-Nazi compound in the south of the island. Hyperborea Two was the home of the Origins Movement, led by Fred McIntosh, who had been a promising research chemist until 1986, when he decided to devote himself entirely to the idea that the ancestors of the white race had come to Earth from the star Alpha Tauri, and their original home on this planet had been a now-vanished temperate continent covering the North Pole. McIntosh taught that the Neanderthals were a race of extraterrestrial Aryan supermen, and their diminished descendants could reactivate their Neanderthal genes through exposure to the Northern Lights. Like most American settlements, Hyperborea Two sustained itself by taking advantage of Greenland’s lax legal regime; they’d built a lab out on the ice, which they were using to produce generic versions of prescription drugs, which they then sold online. Originally the lab was set up to manufacture opiates, benzos, and amphetamines; their bestselling product ended up being aripiprazole, an antipsychotic. In the middle of the night—it’s always night—a figure leaped out of the ice with an unearthly high-pitched scream and tore two armed guards gorily in two. Inside the compound, it ripped through two more Nazis in short order. It was shot in the leg, the shoulder, and the hip without slowing down. A gunshot directly to the head failed to kill it. Finally, one of the Nazis put a round directly through the intruder’s eye, and it collapsed. They posted a photo online, the surviving cultists posing behind the corpse like they’d brought down a buck. Two of them holding up Black Sun flags. McIntosh himself in the middle, gripping an AR-15 tight with his leathery, palsied hands. The nujaqaq lay on its side, all eight feet of it, naked, head lolling, one sightless eye pointed at nothing, one a dried-up wound, with black trails of blood matting the thick white hair that covered every inch of its body.\nThe body was seized by the GPD and handed over to federal authorities. Genomic analysis revealed that what the Origins Movement had killed was, in fact, an Aryan superman. Mitochondrial DNA revealed that around 1% of the ice monster’s ancestry was shared by populations in Iceland and Denmark. The most genetically similar sample overall, though, came from a 38,000-year-old bone found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia. It had belonged to a Neanderthal.\nIt took a long time to find one alive on the ice. Drones with thermal cameras fanned out over Greenland, searching for wandering bands of nujaqaqut, and found nothing. The nujaqaqut don’t travel in bands. Their thick fur means their bodies barely lose any heat. They looked for signs of habitation, but the nujaqaqut don’t build shelters. What they did find was shit, the huge warm logs the nujaqaqut left in crevasses of the ice. Follow the shit, and eventually you’ll find the shitter. The US military tracked a juvenile male as he plodded south across the wilderness, heading towards the homestead of a sports betting website. Before the creature could start mauling the bookies, a strike team helidropped onto the ice to detain it. Getting the nujaqaq into captivity was a brutal, screeching struggle; once locked up at an Air Force facility in Nuuk, though, it was almost embarrassingly docile. It didn’t froth or try to break out of its cell; its calm, quiet gaze was mostly drawn to electric lights. Like a newborn baby. It shrieked and howled when it saw its captors, but without aggression. MRI scans showed that whatever was happening in its head, the nujaqaq vocal tract only allowed a very limited level of voice modulation; these nasal screams were the closest it could get to language. But there didn’t seem to be much happening in its head either. The nujaqaq passed the mirror test, but it wouldn’t look its captors in the face. Attempts to teach it sign language were a dismal failure. The creature just sat calmly and quietly, and its cold blue eyes watched the moving fingers as if they were eddies of ice twisting in the wind. It inhabited a world without meaning.\nBut it was very good at puzzles. The researchers tried a game that offered the nujaqaq a small morsel of food if it could press four coloured buttons in a particular sequence. It could remember a sequence of four. It could remember a series of forty. It could remember a sequence of four hundred. They tried presenting it with increasingly complicated mazes, but it always went for the optimal route without any apparent effort. They gave it a Rubik’s cube, which it solved instantly, but once it became clear that there wasn’t any food inside it showed no interest in solving any of the other, larger cubes it was offered. They tried the memory game again, but this time with numbers instead of colours. Then they tried teaching it basic addition and subtraction, which it took to almost immediately. When a piece of hamburger was on offer, the nujaqaq could multiply twelve-digit integers in its head. A few days later, having burned through everything in their library, the researchers tried giving it the P versus NP problem. The next morning, the nujaqaq had produced eight dense pages demonstrating that P did, in fact, equal NP. Any problem that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Just not by you.\n\nFrom a special hearing on the nujaqaqtut by the Joint Congressional Committee on Greenland.\nSENATOR ‘JUMPING’ JIM SCHPULTZ (R-WY): Ms Rao, just to make sure i’ve got this right—when you introduced yourself earlier, you said you were the CTO of Telperion, Inc., which is a technology services firm based out of Mountain View, California?\nANANYA RAO: That’s correct.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: And you sell—\nANANYA RAO: We partner with clients including the federal government to deliver bespoke solutions for the data problems of tomorrow.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you are not a biologist.\nANANYA RAO: I am not.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Did you minor in biology? AP biology, perhaps?\nANANYA RAO: My background is in computer science, Senator. I don’t see—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Forgive me. I just find it strange, Ms Rao, that you say you’re not a biologist, but at the same time you’ve here to tell us that these, uh, nujaqaqs are human beings.\nANANYA RAO: I’m sorry, but I find your insinuation here incredibly offensive.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: I’m not insinuating anything, I’m only trying to see—\nANANYA RAO: Not so long ago, Senator, this very body held that some people were only three-fifths of a human being. Because of the way they looked and the way they spoke, because they looked different—respectfully, Senator, because they looked different to white men like yourself. There is a shameful history in this country of dehumanisation and violence, and it’s especially shocking, Senator Schpultz, to hear someone revive that hateful language, here, in the twenty-first century. The genus and species of the nujaqaqtut are Homo and sapiens. That’s what the science says.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Ms Rao, this thing is eight feet tall and it eats raw meat. You’re telling me a Neanderthal is Homo sapiens?\nANANYA RAO: That’s what the science says. As far as I know, the law makes no distinction. Title 1 of the US Code says a human being is any member of the species Homo sapiens who is born alive. There’s no exception for Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. Senator, I’m not going to debate their humanity with you. They are as human as you or me, and according to the Greenland Annexation Act—which I remember you promoting as one of your proudest achievements—that means they’re fully entitled to live and work here, and to claim American citizenship if they want.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you’re not saying they’re human like you or me. You’re saying they’re some kind of super human.\nANANYA RAO: I wouldn’t say that at all, no. We believe that all humans have an equal—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Your company says they’re smarter than us. Is that true?\nANANYA RAO: There’s no one measure of intelligence.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: It’s a yes or no answer.\nANANYA RAO: There’s a holistic, multidimensional—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: You’ve been testing them for something. Yes or no.\nANANYA RAO: Yes. They’re smarter than us.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Care to put a number on it? Are we talking about an IQ of 200 here? 300?\nANANYA RAO: Honestly, I can’t say. None of us are smart enough to come up with a test capable of measuring nujaqaq intelligence. Everything we make, they ace.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you’re talking about a group that never invented writing, never invented the wheel…\nANANYA RAO: They need to be in the right environment. The nujaqaqtut find certain things harder than we do. They’re less social, they don’t work so collaboratively. All those brilliant minds were stuck in the Stone Age for two hundred thousand years. But we have the tools to help them realise their potential. There’s now a small colony of nujaqaqtut at the Air Force base in Nuuk that Telperion’s been working with. They can’t speak, but we’ve been teaching them to type. In fact, there’s a little girl there called Ada who wrote you a letter. I have it here.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Go ahead.\nANANYA RAO: She writes: Dear Senator ‘Jumping’ Jim Schpultz, my name is Ada and I am four years old and I love you because you are a US Senator for the state of Wyoming and Wyoming is my favourite state because of all the states it’s the closest to being a perfect square which is my favourite shape. Colorado is also close to being a perfect square but Wyoming is closer than Colorado. Wyoming is defined by geodesics along 41°N to 45°N latitude and 104°W to 111°W longitude so its borders form a near-spherical quadrilateral however the Earth is not a perfect sphere so using the Vincenty formula on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid its north-south and east-west geodesic lengths are approximately 570.3 km and 444.4 km which means an aspect ratio of 1.28. Colorado’s aspect ratio is 1.36 which makes it less like a perfect square. However even though the meridional convergence at higher latitudes contributes to Wyoming’s lower aspect ratio Colorado’s angular excess on the WGS84 ellipsoid calculated with L’Huillier’s theorem is 0.38 while Wyoming’s angular excess is 2.35° which means Wyoming has greater distortion on an ellipsoidal manifold and therefore Colorado is actually more like a square as plotted in Euclidean space. One day I want to visit Wyoming and see its famous sights which include Devil’s Tower National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Yours sincerely, Ada.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: That’s very sweet.\nANANYA RAO: Thank you.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: She sure sounds like a smart kid.\nANANYA RAO: She is.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But as sweet as your letter is, it’s not the only letter I’ve been receiving. See, I also got a letter from Dr Sarah Fang. Dr Fang is an anthropologist attached to the Air Force Culture and Language Center out of Maxwell AFB in Alabama, and the whole time you’ve been studying these nujaqaqs, she’s been studying them too. Unlike yourself, she can’t appear before this hearing, but she tells me that the, uh, cries and wails of these—let’s call them these folks you have there in Greenland—to the extent that they’re a language, it’s now been pretty well deciphered. Now you can call that little, that little pup you have—you can call her Ada if you want, but her mother never called her that. Dr Fang tells me that in the language she actually speaks, there’s no such thing as a name. They don’t have them. There’s also no words, she says, for ‘me’ or ‘you.’ Are you aware, Ms Rao, of any human languages that don’t have a word for ‘me’ or ‘you’?\nANANYA RAO: I’m not a linguist.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: You’re not a linguist. Now, earlier, you said that the nujaqaqs don’t work as collaboratively as we do. Well, that’s one way of putting it. Dr Fang tells me the same thing. She says they have no form of social organisation whatsoever. They don’t have chiefs or leaders, they don’t have collective myths or narratives, they don’t build any kind of individual or collective dwellings, and they don’t have any concept at all of God. Even monkeys touch and groom each other, but not these fellas. They do not have such a thing as family. Once a child is weaned, the mother just abandons it on the ice. I reckon my dog is a better mother than that. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you might wonder how a species that hates its own kind so badly would even manage to survive so long. Well, in her report, Dr Fang explains it. Let me read here. In the absence of any stable mating or kinship structures, she writes, Nunjaqaq reproduction is achieved sporadically and opportunistically, almost exclusively through what our society would consider rape.\nA murmur in the room. Whispers fluttering. The creak of seats.\nANANYA RAO: Senator, this is naked fearmongering. We’re talking about a situation—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Now, I understand that Telperion stands to make a lot of money from these nujaqaqs. You have your Big Tech shareholders to answer to, and that’s our American system. But I have my constituents. What am I supposed to say to the parents of a little girl who’s been raped by one of your pet geniuses? How am I supposed to comfort them when their little angel has been raped, savagely raped, and then not just killed, but killed and eaten? You are talking about introducing a population of prehistoric predators into our country. You want to bring these man-eating carnivores into our towns and cities, into our workplaces, into our schools. You say they’re entitled to be part of our American society. You say you’re not going to debate their humanity, but that’s exactly the debate we need to have. Now I reckon that if you don’t have any notion of a family, any notion of home, or any notion of God, that disqualifies you right there from being an American. And to be frank, if you go about buck naked and you live off human flesh, whatever you may be, it isn’t human. These are wild animals, and if you let them in here, they will do exactly what they did in the Pleistocene. They will rape, and they will kill, and they will eat. And I tell you now, Ms Rao, as God is my witness I am not going to let you or your monsters do that to any of my little girls.\nUproar. Four members of the Joint Committee start shouting at once. Members of the press rush towards the podium. A clamour from two of the other expert witnesses, objecting in the most strenuous possible terms. The Ambassador from Denmark is trying to bellow over everyone, mottled red and white and clammy like a slice of bacon. Another expert witness is rocking back and forth and giggling to himself. Beasts! he giggles. Beasts! Monsters! Subhuman! Someone lands a punch on Senator ‘Jumping’ Jim Schpultz and suddenly the entire hall is a froth of human bodies pressing and tearing at each other. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is buried under a frenzied, amorous mob of her own staffers. Shreds of red cloth spurt upwards into the air. Meanwhile some members of the public have cornered Senator John Fetterman (D-PA). We found one, they bellow, he’s here, they brought one here. They advance with makeshift spears made from tripods and table legs and bits of doorframe, jabbing Senator Fetterman in the gut as he moans in inarticulate rage. The Capitol Police arrive, but after their orders to stop are ignored they start firing at random into the churning crowd. Finally, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), presiding, briefly achieves consciousness long enough to call the committee to order. Calm returns. Ananya Rao and Senator Schpultz return to their positions.\nANANYA RAO: Senator, you seem very concerned by what the ancestors of the nujaqaqtut did in the Pleistocene. I’d remind you that back then, our ancestors hunted them to the point of extinction. You say that they haven’t changed. Have we?\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: No. I yield the floor.\n\nThe day the Supreme Court announced its verdict in Telperion v. California, the stock market soared. Nujaqaq Intelligence was about to remake the world. A solution for climate change. A solution for disease. A solution for death. Telperion nearly doubled in value. It was also a very good day for Steyr, Beretta, and Bushmaster. Millions of civilian customers, all suddenly very interested in buying a .50 calibre anti-materiel rifle.\nIn the end, Telperion hadn’t made the compassionate case for nujaqaq humanity. No one was interested in that sort of thing any more; the world had moved on. They’d just pointed out that the United States had long set a precedent in which the best and brightest individuals from across the world had a right to settle in the country, and even during the age of racial restrictions on immigration, the fundamental criterion had always been intelligence. The Court’s function was to safeguard the interests of the United States, and it was obviously in the national interest to possess the nujaqaqtut. If America didn’t, China would. Delivering the majority verdict, Justice Sailer estimated that recognising as few as one hundred nujaqaqtut as American citizens would shift the national IQ past Germany; two hundred and the average American would be just a hair smarter than the average Chinese. With three hundred nujaqaqtut, every American, whatever their background, could say with pride that they belonged to the smartest country in the world.\nThe same day saw a large earthquake near Volgograd in Russia. Half the city flattened; dust-caked children crawling out the ruins of their homes. Volgograd is not a seismically active region. The Russian government announced that it believed the earthquake was caused by the United States, using some new weapon provided by its army of inhuman morozniks. Any further disasters on Russian soil would be considered an act of war by the United States, and met with an appropriate response. But what counts as a disaster? A snowstorm? A car accident? Anything; the enemy can do anything. What about the ordinary miseries of life? Later, a meeting of the Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church affirmed that the morozniks are demons.\nIn Copenhagen, the Danish government was in frantic conversation with its lawyers. The country was not doing well; half its economy had spontaneously evaporated when Ozempic users started ascending to Buddhahood and shedding the brute carapace of the physical body. That was why the Frederiksen government had agreed to start talking with Donald Trump about Greenland, and in the end they got nothing. They couldn’t sign over the island without a referendum, but then, once the Greenlanders had made it clear that they’d rather be Americans, how could Denmark take any money? The artist of the deal had won again, the government had collapsed, there were riots on the streets—and that was before a the world’s most valuable natural resource had been found in the land they’d just given away. Now Prime Minister Paludan and his Stram Kurs Party were leading a country on the point of collapse. If Denmark didn’t get something out of these nujaqaqtut, it might be civil war…\nIn London, the widely despised essayist Sam Kriss—now hunchbacked, jowly, and bald as the Moon—wrote what was generally considered to be the single worst take published on the issue. Kriss begins by limply hailing the result in Telperion v. California as an important blow against the forces of nativism and bigotry, obviously, obviously, we all agree. The nujaqaqtut will, he concedes, be able to integrate seamlessly into modern Western society. But what does it say about our society, he asks, that this is possible? ‘Everything that’s supposed to be strange and foreign about the nujaqaqtut is actually strangely familiar. The only human society with no creation myth, no culture-heroes, no metaphysical beliefs about the world—except, of course, from our own. We can understand metaphor, figurative language, murky forms of signification that doesn’t operate on the same naïve principle as number, and they can’t—but haven’t you people looked at this year’s Booker shortlist? Our literary culture is a shrinking circle of screeching literalists; everyone else has reverted to a preliterate, almost prehominid state, lapping up the natural signs that trickle out their phones. The biggest difference, though, is that nujaqaqtut society isn’t really a society at all, just a sprawling mass of isolated individuals who can only relate to each other through sporadic acts of violence. You see where I’m going here. When the nativists say that nujaqaqtut can never be real Americans, they’re not just bigoted; they’re factually incorrect. America is a society founded not on human social relations, but the principle of utility and selection, paring off population sectors from Europe and Africa, rearranging them in an inhuman hierarchy of phenotypes. Once this radical disarticulation was called Liberty. No one uses that word any more, but they’re still at it. The very notion of skilled immigration, attracting the best and brightest, most of all of intelligence as an abstract quantity: it’s a Neanderthal notion, a notion for lonely savages that howl wordless in the night. We are not for solving puzzles. I truly believe we are, in some sense, for loving each other. Thirty thousand years ago, this difference between ourselves and the Neanderthals was so profound that it could only be resolved through a war of extermination. We won that war, despite having far less computational power in our brains, because we could give names to the stars and build a commons out of the sky, and they could not. But in the end, it was all for nothing. We took the long way round, but we and the Neanderthals have converged on the same autistic point.’\nThe essay continues in this vein for another twenty-three thousand words, helpfully split into four paragraphs. Afterwards, the few remaining editors who still put up with Kriss all independently decided to stop replying to his emails. And he deserved it, because the essay was wrong on every point. Maybe if he’d bothered to ask the nujaqaqtut if they thought they were exactly the same as their hosts, he might have understood.\nIn Greenland, the great hunt was finally winding down. In fact, the whole island was winding down. Most of the half a million American settlers had already returned to the mainland: Greenland is over, it’s washed, the money’s dried up; the only way to be a big deal in Greenland is to get mauled to death by a nujaqaq. A lot of Inuit were leaving too. You can live in a dark, narrow apartment built by the Danes in 1967, or you can move to Houston, get a job on an offshore oil rig, and put your family in a brand-new house with a three-car garage. Obvious choice. The ice can creak to itself. Pointless to stay, now the nujaqaqut were gone. Operation Guardian Watch had been a success, but it came at a heavy price: some two hundred US servicemen killed or woundedin various engagements while trying to safely subdue a shrieking foaming nujaqaq. There was some unfortunate but unavoidable loss of life on the other side too, but of a total population above eight thousand, less than one thousand nujaqaqtut died in the relocation process. Now, after months of waiting, the next stage could begin. Telperion sent a fleet of especially modified jets to Nuuk. On each flight, a hundred nujaqaqtut sat in rows, heavily sedated, chained to their seats, transported to America.\nThey lived in underground cells on the Telperion campus in Mountain View. They liked the dark. They liked the sense of being enclosed. They liked going online too, although there was something about the way they typed that always seemed to make other users upset with them. Sometimes they were asked to solve small, self-evident mathematical problems, so they solved them. Is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra? Is the Mandelbrot set locally connected? The nujaqaqtut didn’t wonder why their hosts kept bothering them with this piddling stuff; that’s not the kind of question they think about. But they tried to fit in. They had learned about names; they had picked out new names for themselves from a list. They didn’t mingle outside their cells but they liked to chat on Discord. Some of them, like Cody and Dana and Ellen, had shaved their hair, the glorious thick white hair that protected them on the ice, to reveal the raw pink skin underneath. A smooth, pink face. Cody claimed to have listened to music. The company had told him he might enjoy something called Bach, which was made of numbers, but the chaos of reverberating strings and air moving through pipes had been so horrible he’d had to turn it off after only a few seconds. Ellen had started wearing clothes. It was uncomfortable; the sensation of clothes against her naked skin; the first time she shrieked uncontrollably and tore them to pieces. After a few weeks she was wearing them all the time. She didn’t go up any more, though. The one time she did go outside she had liked walking around on the grass and touching the trees, observing the little birds that made noises like moving ice, but then she came to the edge of the campus and on the other side of the fence there was a huge group of them, all shouting and yelling and they threw rocks over the fence to hit her. These were the creatures that had stormed out of nowhere fifty thousand years ago to destroy the world, and now it had happened again. They looked like smaller, weaker, hairless humans, but they weren’t human at all; they were something else. An insect, a type of ant or bee, a hive-kind, almost mindless but swarming. Ellen knew what it meant to be happy or sad or angry but it made no sense that these things could be happy or sad or angry in a group. Their angry swarm had swallowed everything until Ellen was reduced to the furthest patch of ice on the edge of the world, but it wasn’t enough. Eventually there had been someone on the ice. Ellen stood and stared at the swarm as it shrieked and wailed its strange collective fury. Rocks bounced harmlessly off her head.\n\n\n\n\nEEOOOOOOOOOOOGH!",

I go up there for you, to hear the future on the wind. But whenever I descend from the mountain with new prophecies for the coming year, it&#8217;s to a bunch of miserable complaints from you lot. Apparently, my prophecies &#8216;aren&#8217;t accurate.&#8217; Apparently, I&#8217;m just &#8216;making up things that sound interesting with no actual vatic quality.&#8217; Apparently I&#8217;m &#8216;outperformed by every prediction market going plus a bunch of supposedly psychic aquarium creatures.&#8217; The evidence is that <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2023\">in 2023</a> I predicted that Donald Trump would die, and he didn&#8217;t, and then <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2024\">in 2024</a> I predicted that the US election would be won by <em>nobody</em>, and it wasn&#8217;t. &#8216;The 2024 election,&#8217; I wrote, &#8216;will simply <em>never end</em>. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end.&#8217; I&#8217;m told the Democrats are still fundraising as if there&#8217;s something at stake, but everyone else has agreed that there was in fact a winner, and it was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, I predicted that the Tories would somehow win the general election in the UK, which they didn&#8217;t, and that 2024 would feature some major act of fuckery by the Dutch, which they&#8217;ve managed to keep well hidden. It&#8217;s got to the point where I can&#8217;t so much as descend from my mountain without a mob of furious peasants braying unintelligibly at me while pointing at various misshapen vegetables whose advent I apparently failed to foresee. </p><p>I refuse to apologise. You haven&#8217;t been up on the mountain; I have. My prophecies are perfect. You live beneath the clouds, and you simply haven&#8217;t understood.</p><p>Take my election prophecy. Yes, I said that &#8216;Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they&#8217;ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died.&#8217; (I did correctly predict a Trump victory in September, but that doesn&#8217;t count.) Isn&#8217;t it weird, though, that the best part of a prophecy supposedly about how immovable Trump and Biden are was instead devoted to <em>Kamala Harris</em>? In the depths of last winter, I somehow had a vision of the Brat Summer that was coming. This is how prophecy works. There are wheels within wheels here; it takes a subtle reader to look past the overt content and see how I was actually completely right all along. Most readers are not subtle readers. But I think <em>you</em> might be. I don&#8217;t know how I can tell, but I have this strange sense that you&#8217;re better and smarter than the dumb pigs who read my prophecies. You see what&#8217;s really going on. You aren&#8217;t fooled by the surfaces of things&#8230;</p><p>If you need any more evidence, though, I&#8217;ll just point out that one year ago I wrote that while AI wouldn&#8217;t replace literary prose, it would start replacing ordinary conversation. &#8216;Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone&#8217;s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response.&#8217; Apple is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deNzYrTvqCs\">now advertising my nightmares as a nifty new feature</a>. I prophesied that all the Simone Weil-inflected flirtation with religious dogma had reached a cultural saturation point and we&#8217;d be heading back towards a kind of resurgent Even Newer Atheism, and last year the Grey Tribe scored its first act of spectacular public violence, which is basically a Bar Mitzvah for ideologies. (More on that later.) I prophesied that the new alternative media would start to recede, and everything would return to being consolidated around a few big mainstream outlets, and this has turned out truer than I ever imagined: in fact, this year&#8217;s most lively topic of debate on Substack, the home of lively debate, is <a href=\"https://thepointmag.substack.com/p/becca-rothfeld-and-sam-kahn-on-substack\">how much worse</a> Substack is than traditional magazine publishing. </p><p>If the overt meanings of last year&#8217;s prophecies were sometimes confusing, though, it can only be because I arrived at them in part through a three-card Tarot draw. I saw the year unfold in the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. But the Tarot is a subtle instrument, and reading it requires digging through many strata of meaning, all of them obscure. Maybe you need a clearer, more scientific approach. Luckily, we have one. </p><p>The year 2025 was born on January 1st, 2025, which makes it a Capricorn. Capricorn is an Earth sign, grounded, plodding, materialistic; one of the draught animals of the Zodiac. It&#8217;s under the rulership of Saturn: the melancholy king at the edge of space, who sets the limit and imposes the law, god of age and time. The obvious conclusion is that 2025 will not be a year of revolutions. We&#8217;ll see more reactionary retrenchment, more state crackdowns, more grey normality over the earth. The only problem is that <em>every</em> year is a Capricorn, since they all begin in early January. 1789 was a Capricorn; 1968 was a Capricorn. The numbered calendar year is always a Capricorn because the numbered calendar year is a bureaucratic imposition on the wild flows of time. Fortunately, we&#8217;re not limited to sun sign astrology, but the planets all seem to be telling the same story. 2025 was born at midnight on Caroline Island in Kiribati, an uninhabited atoll that happens to be the first patch of land after the International Date Line. This puts the Moon in 2025&#8217;s sixth house: it&#8217;ll be a humble, housebound year, sickly, mildly feeble. There might not be another pandemic, but it&#8217;ll feel like there is. Venus is in the seventh house, the House of Balance. This year will be dowdy, unsexy; not necessarily unfulfilling but basically passionless. A cultural trend away from both expressive blue-haired perversion and frothing inceldom, towards a generally neutral erotic stasis. Mars is in the twelfth house: the sector of the sky reserved for dreams, mystery, the shadow, the unthinking parts of the mind. There will be secret wars. Nameless conflicts fought underground. The same goes for the culture war: you will no longer know what to call your enemy, or even what side you yourself are on. </p><p>But I know, because I&#8217;ve heard it on the mountain. This is what I can tell you about your year:</p><h4>Politics is already over</h4><p>Two big things allegedly happened while I was away. Firstly, the Assad regime in Syria&#8212;which had survived over thirteen years of civil war, clawing back almost all its former territory inch by shell-blasted inch&#8212;completely collapsed in a rebel offensive that barely lasted a week. During the middle of the offensive, the CEO of a major American health insurance firm was assassinated in broad daylight in New York. The alleged killer turned out to be a handsome and charming twenty-six-year-old with sexy eyebrows and an impressive physique, and he became an instant folk hero. Crowds cheer Luigi Mangione as he&#8217;s paraded into a courtroom. Crowds wave revolutionary flags in the old centre of Damascus. Some of them are dressed like SpongeBob SquarePants. Everything seems fluid again. Politics is back; history is back; big mass energies are being unleashed, the world can be overthrown in an instant&#8230; </p><p>I&#8217;m not so sure. Last year, I prophesied that one single political event, the US presidential election, would not happen. This time, I may as well go double or quits. <em>There will be absolutely no political events whatsoever in 2025</em>.</p><p>I think this is actually a fairly reasonable prediction, since basically everything that passes for politics turns out to be something else. Look at Syria. How did the regime fall so fast? The government forces that had held the state together by killing maybe half a million of its citizens seemed to suddenly dissolve into nothing. There was no great last stand, not even in the capital, not even in the Alawite regions along the coast. The chemical weapons stayed in their silos. No cities pounded into rubble. No long gruelling battles. The entire country was won and lost with only a few hundred casualties on each side. The reason the regime fell so quickly is that <em>there was no regime</em>. Bashar al-Assad might have lingered around his palace in Damascus, a great gormless national ghost, but his government was essentially overthrown maybe a decade ago. Syria was <em>actually</em> governed by an intricate feudal patchwork of local militia, armed tribes, mafia groups, religious orders, narco gangs, reconciled rebels, and foreign actors. All of these ruled their own minor fiefdoms through various forms of extortion, criminality, and terror, but the only ones with any real military capacity were the foreign actors. In 2024, Iran and Hezbollah had bigger problems than the fate of the world&#8217;s biggest captagon factory, and pulled out. The wave that followed wasn&#8217;t really an offensive in any conventional sense. All these local fiefs simply changed the patches on their camo jackets. Before, they had been sitting in plastic chairs, smoking and collecting bribes while calling themselves the Syrian Arab Army. Now, they&#8217;re doing it while calling themselves the Syrian Salvation Government. There&#8217;s one fewer Damascene with a head like a toilet brush, and one more in Moscow. Aside from that, essentially nothing has changed. </p><p>Syria is the model for everything that will appear to happen in 2025. There will be no events. There will be no shifts. The entire discourse of politics will spiral into irrelevance. What you will get, though, are various versions of an amphetamine gang sewing new patches onto their shirts. </p><p>There was a very palpable disappointment from dead-end political commentators when the mystery health insurance assassin was finally named as Luigi Mangione, because Mangione&#8217;s politics were seemingly impossible to place. He liked Joe Rogan, the notion of masculinity, and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, but he also disliked climate change, Jordan Peterson, and, clearly, the private healthcare system. According to his Goodreads, he&#8217;d read the Unambomber manifesto, but given it a lukewarm four-star review. Meanwhile, he gave five stars to something called <em>The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future</em>. He appears to have been the only person ever radicalised into violence by TED talks. The consensus is that Mangione&#8217;s politics were <em>incoherent</em>: he took bits and pieces from various systems of thought and combined them into a misshapen ideological golem of his own design. But his politics were perfectly coherent, they just weren&#8217;t a politics.</p><p>What Mangione ultimately believed in was an ideology of <em>personal optimisation</em>. This is what&#8217;s left after all politics have been exhausted, the 2010s left and the 2020s right. There&#8217;s still the relentless need to improve <em>something</em>, but it&#8217;s no longer directed outwards. As we&#8217;ve discovered, another world is not actually possible, but there are ways to live better in this one. You can cut down on caffeine and pornography, organise your notebooks, work out more efficiently at the gym, and listen to podcasts that nourish your brain instead of numbing it. Collective action is foreclosed, but there&#8217;s still time to get on a good nootropics stack. None of this is incoherent; it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to limit your focus to the things you can change. Or when you lift your gaze to the world at large again, it makes sense to consider all social conflicts as engineering problems. There are blockages in the free flow of smart ideas that prevent systems from running optimally. Some of those blockages can be cleared with the right information, or with mosquito nets. Some of them can be cleared with bullets. </p><p>This Tim Urbanism-Andrew Hubermanism is not the only nonpolitical ideology circulating. There&#8217;s a closely related variant that encourages you to get into massive debt buying crypto and bad art. There was one that prescribed moral self-improvement via polyamory, weight gain, and pop music; somehow, this managed to pass itself off as &#8216;leftism&#8217; for the best part of a decade. Whatever its flavour, though, the real name for this ideology is <em>hysteria</em>.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nThe mountain is very high, and up on its summit, far above the thick wash of grey clouds that hides the truth of the world from people like you, the winds of prophecy whisper strange whisperings into my ears. I go up there for you, to hear the future on the wind. But whenever I descend from the mountain with new prophecies for the coming year, it’s to a bunch of miserable complaints from you lot. Apparently, my prophecies ‘aren’t accurate.’ Apparently, I’m just ‘making up things that sound interesting with no actual vatic quality.’ Apparently I’m ‘outperformed by every prediction market going plus a bunch of supposedly psychic aquarium creatures.’ The evidence is that in 2023 I predicted that Donald Trump would die, and he didn’t, and then in 2024 I predicted that the US election would be won by nobody, and it wasn’t. ‘The 2024 election,’ I wrote, ‘will simply never end. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end.’ I’m told the Democrats are still fundraising as if there’s something at stake, but everyone else has agreed that there was in fact a winner, and it was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, I predicted that the Tories would somehow win the general election in the UK, which they didn’t, and that 2024 would feature some major act of fuckery by the Dutch, which they’ve managed to keep well hidden. It’s got to the point where I can’t so much as descend from my mountain without a mob of furious peasants braying unintelligibly at me while pointing at various misshapen vegetables whose advent I apparently failed to foresee.\nI refuse to apologise. You haven’t been up on the mountain; I have. My prophecies are perfect. You live beneath the clouds, and you simply haven’t understood.\nTake my election prophecy. Yes, I said that ‘Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they’ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died.’ (I did correctly predict a Trump victory in September, but that doesn’t count.) Isn’t it weird, though, that the best part of a prophecy supposedly about how immovable Trump and Biden are was instead devoted to Kamala Harris? In the depths of last winter, I somehow had a vision of the Brat Summer that was coming. This is how prophecy works. There are wheels within wheels here; it takes a subtle reader to look past the overt content and see how I was actually completely right all along. Most readers are not subtle readers. But I think you might be. I don’t know how I can tell, but I have this strange sense that you’re better and smarter than the dumb pigs who read my prophecies. You see what’s really going on. You aren’t fooled by the surfaces of things…\nIf you need any more evidence, though, I’ll just point out that one year ago I wrote that while AI wouldn’t replace literary prose, it would start replacing ordinary conversation. ‘Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone’s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response.’ Apple is now advertising my nightmares as a nifty new feature. I prophesied that all the Simone Weil-inflected flirtation with religious dogma had reached a cultural saturation point and we’d be heading back towards a kind of resurgent Even Newer Atheism, and last year the Grey Tribe scored its first act of spectacular public violence, which is basically a Bar Mitzvah for ideologies. (More on that later.) I prophesied that the new alternative media would start to recede, and everything would return to being consolidated around a few big mainstream outlets, and this has turned out truer than I ever imagined: in fact, this year’s most lively topic of debate on Substack, the home of lively debate, is how much worse Substack is than traditional magazine publishing.\nIf the overt meanings of last year’s prophecies were sometimes confusing, though, it can only be because I arrived at them in part through a three-card Tarot draw. I saw the year unfold in the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. But the Tarot is a subtle instrument, and reading it requires digging through many strata of meaning, all of them obscure. Maybe you need a clearer, more scientific approach. Luckily, we have one.\nThe year 2025 was born on January 1st, 2025, which makes it a Capricorn. Capricorn is an Earth sign, grounded, plodding, materialistic; one of the draught animals of the Zodiac. It’s under the rulership of Saturn: the melancholy king at the edge of space, who sets the limit and imposes the law, god of age and time. The obvious conclusion is that 2025 will not be a year of revolutions. We’ll see more reactionary retrenchment, more state crackdowns, more grey normality over the earth. The only problem is that every year is a Capricorn, since they all begin in early January. 1789 was a Capricorn; 1968 was a Capricorn. The numbered calendar year is always a Capricorn because the numbered calendar year is a bureaucratic imposition on the wild flows of time. Fortunately, we’re not limited to sun sign astrology, but the planets all seem to be telling the same story. 2025 was born at midnight on Caroline Island in Kiribati, an uninhabited atoll that happens to be the first patch of land after the International Date Line. This puts the Moon in 2025’s sixth house: it’ll be a humble, housebound year, sickly, mildly feeble. There might not be another pandemic, but it’ll feel like there is. Venus is in the seventh house, the House of Balance. This year will be dowdy, unsexy; not necessarily unfulfilling but basically passionless. A cultural trend away from both expressive blue-haired perversion and frothing inceldom, towards a generally neutral erotic stasis. Mars is in the twelfth house: the sector of the sky reserved for dreams, mystery, the shadow, the unthinking parts of the mind. There will be secret wars. Nameless conflicts fought underground. The same goes for the culture war: you will no longer know what to call your enemy, or even what side you yourself are on.\nBut I know, because I’ve heard it on the mountain. This is what I can tell you about your year:\nPolitics is already over\nTwo big things allegedly happened while I was away. Firstly, the Assad regime in Syria—which had survived over thirteen years of civil war, clawing back almost all its former territory inch by shell-blasted inch—completely collapsed in a rebel offensive that barely lasted a week. During the middle of the offensive, the CEO of a major American health insurance firm was assassinated in broad daylight in New York. The alleged killer turned out to be a handsome and charming twenty-six-year-old with sexy eyebrows and an impressive physique, and he became an instant folk hero. Crowds cheer Luigi Mangione as he’s paraded into a courtroom. Crowds wave revolutionary flags in the old centre of Damascus. Some of them are dressed like SpongeBob SquarePants. Everything seems fluid again. Politics is back; history is back; big mass energies are being unleashed, the world can be overthrown in an instant…\nI’m not so sure. Last year, I prophesied that one single political event, the US presidential election, would not happen. This time, I may as well go double or quits. There will be absolutely no political events whatsoever in 2025.\nI think this is actually a fairly reasonable prediction, since basically everything that passes for politics turns out to be something else. Look at Syria. How did the regime fall so fast? The government forces that had held the state together by killing maybe half a million of its citizens seemed to suddenly dissolve into nothing. There was no great last stand, not even in the capital, not even in the Alawite regions along the coast. The chemical weapons stayed in their silos. No cities pounded into rubble. No long gruelling battles. The entire country was won and lost with only a few hundred casualties on each side. The reason the regime fell so quickly is that there was no regime. Bashar al-Assad might have lingered around his palace in Damascus, a great gormless national ghost, but his government was essentially overthrown maybe a decade ago. Syria was actually governed by an intricate feudal patchwork of local militia, armed tribes, mafia groups, religious orders, narco gangs, reconciled rebels, and foreign actors. All of these ruled their own minor fiefdoms through various forms of extortion, criminality, and terror, but the only ones with any real military capacity were the foreign actors. In 2024, Iran and Hezbollah had bigger problems than the fate of the world’s biggest captagon factory, and pulled out. The wave that followed wasn’t really an offensive in any conventional sense. All these local fiefs simply changed the patches on their camo jackets. Before, they had been sitting in plastic chairs, smoking and collecting bribes while calling themselves the Syrian Arab Army. Now, they’re doing it while calling themselves the Syrian Salvation Government. There’s one fewer Damascene with a head like a toilet brush, and one more in Moscow. Aside from that, essentially nothing has changed.\nSyria is the model for everything that will appear to happen in 2025. There will be no events. There will be no shifts. The entire discourse of politics will spiral into irrelevance. What you will get, though, are various versions of an amphetamine gang sewing new patches onto their shirts.\nThere was a very palpable disappointment from dead-end political commentators when the mystery health insurance assassin was finally named as Luigi Mangione, because Mangione’s politics were seemingly impossible to place. He liked Joe Rogan, the notion of masculinity, and Atlas Shrugged, but he also disliked climate change, Jordan Peterson, and, clearly, the private healthcare system. According to his Goodreads, he’d read the Unambomber manifesto, but given it a lukewarm four-star review. Meanwhile, he gave five stars to something called The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future. He appears to have been the only person ever radicalised into violence by TED talks. The consensus is that Mangione’s politics were incoherent: he took bits and pieces from various systems of thought and combined them into a misshapen ideological golem of his own design. But his politics were perfectly coherent, they just weren’t a politics.\nWhat Mangione ultimately believed in was an ideology of personal optimisation. This is what’s left after all politics have been exhausted, the 2010s left and the 2020s right. There’s still the relentless need to improve something, but it’s no longer directed outwards. As we’ve discovered, another world is not actually possible, but there are ways to live better in this one. You can cut down on caffeine and pornography, organise your notebooks, work out more efficiently at the gym, and listen to podcasts that nourish your brain instead of numbing it. Collective action is foreclosed, but there’s still time to get on a good nootropics stack. None of this is incoherent; it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to limit your focus to the things you can change. Or when you lift your gaze to the world at large again, it makes sense to consider all social conflicts as engineering problems. There are blockages in the free flow of smart ideas that prevent systems from running optimally. Some of those blockages can be cleared with the right information, or with mosquito nets. Some of them can be cleared with bullets.\nThis Tim Urbanism-Andrew Hubermanism is not the only nonpolitical ideology circulating. There’s a closely related variant that encourages you to get into massive debt buying crypto and bad art. There was one that prescribed moral self-improvement via polyamory, weight gain, and pop music; somehow, this managed to pass itself off as ‘leftism’ for the best part of a decade. Whatever its flavour, though, the real name for this ideology is hysteria. All this working on yourself, approaching your own self like a raw material in the production process—who am I? who am I?—means looking at yourself from the outside, through the eyes of someone or something else. The actual question: who am I to you? The trace of some shapeless, nameless, unidentifiable Other, the one you do it for, the one who would finally be able to tell you what you are.\nPeople are tired of politics, not because politics has become too hysterical, but because in an age of stasis and patch-switching, politics is no longer an effective framework for their hysteria. It’s no longer satisfying to answer the question who am I to the other with a load of culture-war blather. Now, even political terrorism can become a form of self-improvement. In 2025, the new apoloticism will colonise even more beloved, old-fashioned political forms. The second Donald Trump presidency will be dominated by a kind of apolitical populism, directed more against seed oils and xenoestrogens than imports, migrants, or the liberal classes. (The end of last year saw a minor civil war within the MAGA movement over the H1B visa. On one side, a lingering residue of mawkish reactionaries who genuinely thought Trump would send all the foreigners home; on the other, Trump’s new coterie of fundamentally apolitical Silicon Valley solutionists, with firms powered by migrant labour.

This is what everyone tells you to do: get out of the big cities and experience the calm and tranquility of small-town India. I&#8217;m just not sure you&#8217;re supposed to do it in Bihar. Even my Indian friends were very concerned to learn I was coming here, because among Indians Bihar has the same bad reputation India has in the rest of the world. According to the stereotype, Bihar is flat, dusty, polluted, chaotic, and poor. It has far too many people, and while they&#8217;re all wonderful on an individual level, genuine and hardworking, they&#8217;re also generally considered to be ignorant, illiterate, toothless, crippled petty criminals who practice rape as a form of light entertainment. Biharis keep migrating to greener, more prosperous parts of India, where they live in shanties and work for drastically lower wages than the locals, who often quickly and violently turn against them. In Bihar itself the bridges keep collapsing, the politicians keep getting arrested for corruption, and the rural population keep committing gory caste massacres in what&#8217;s effectively an undeclared civil war. Unfortunately, this stereotype comes with statistics. Bihar is India&#8217;s second-largest state, with nearly 130 million people. 89% of them live in rural areas, more than anywhere outside the Himalayas. It has the lowest average income, lowest GDP per capita, and highest poverty rate in the country. If Bihar were an independent country, it would be the tenth largest in the world, with more people than Japan or Mexico. It would also instantly become one of the poorest countries on the planet, behind such beacons of development as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan. A population the size of Russia, forgotten under the belly of the world, and living at the extremes of human misery.</p><p>My train arrived just before six in the evening, which was a problem. Despite spanning nearly two thousand miles from east to west, India only has one time zone, which means that in the eastern regions it gets dark early, and the one thing everyone had told me about Bihar was that I should not go out at night. There&#8217;s no nightlife here. No cocktail bars. People drink, but they drink at home, and mostly just so they can beat their wives. There is no good reason to be on the streets after dark. Stay in your hotel and try not to make too much noise. You should absolutely not attempt to travel overland at night. The countryside teems with throat-slitting bandits, and tourists are routinely robbed. Unfortunately, our hotel was a good long drive from the train station, in a small town upriver surrounded by lots of dark, empty fields. One of my Indian friends told me to watch out for a cop outside the station. If we tried to arrange a lift without a cop&#8217;s help, there was a chance the driver would pull into a dark rural track, threaten me and my girlfriend with a knife, take our money and passports, and then leave our bodies by the side of the road. If we asked the policeman to find us a car, this was essentially guaranteed. Afterwards, the cop would get half the take.</p><p>So as our car squeaked and clattered over an unmarked and barely paved road, I kept the optimal route open on my phone, staring at the blue dot as it moved down along the blue line. As long as we&#8217;re on the line, everything&#8217;s fine. Nothing will hurt me as long as we&#8217;re on the line. It took about five minutes before the driver suddenly veered off it. Now we were on a lightless dirt track surrounded by low and lumpy mud huts. My girlfriend and I looked warily at each other. This is it, I thought. This is the day they&#8217;re finally going to hack me to death. We trundled deeper into the backlands, as our driver hummed a benign little tune to himself. I should do something, I thought. I could try to reach over and grab the wheel. I could garrotte him with my shoelace. I could refuse to go quietly. But instead, I noticed, I&#8217;m doing nothing. Any second now he&#8217;s going to pull over, drag me out the car, and cut me into thin slices with a machete, and I&#8217;m doing nothing. I&#8217;m watching the blue dot on my phone as it moves further and further in the wrong direction. But it was impossible to imagine that this ordinary car journey would really be what made the sun and the stars go out forever. That I could spend the next five minutes getting mildly carsick by scrolling on Instagram, and then be violently murdered at the end. The genres didn&#8217;t match. As long as I keep looking at my phone and doing nothing, I thought, this won&#8217;t turn into a struggle to the death in a moving vehicle. Pretend everything&#8217;s normal, and maybe I won&#8217;t even feel the blow that kills me&#8230;</p><p>The next morning, in the hotel room, I felt a bit silly about the whole thing. Clearly, I&#8217;d let myself be influenced by a cruel stereotype about this place. In reality, Bihar might have its struggles, but where doesn&#8217;t? It&#8217;s still a basically ordinary place, inhabited by basically ordinary people. In fact, we&#8217;d met some honeymooning Biharis in the south, and they&#8217;d been wonderful. They even gave me their phone number in case I decided to come to Patna. I&#8217;ve been in India long enough, I decided; there&#8217;s nothing here I haven&#8217;t seen before. And then, full of confidence, I went outside.</p><p>The hotel is on a squiggle of paved road running through the centre of town, loud with the beeping of motorcyclists as they fail to thread their way through the crowds. Away from there, the whole place crumbles into filth. My phone took us on a walk along a street that turned out to have been repurposed as an open sewer, fringed with green slime. Since no one drives down here any more, people have built shanties in the middle of it. They live directly on top of the slurry. Behind the Punjab National Bank there&#8217;s an enormous pit of sodden garbage. Black squealing piglets darting around between heaps of plastic and human waste. A corrugated-iron shack is luxury. People live in low hovels made of cow dung. They cook their food over burning cow-dung cakes. It&#8217;s a grey land: this is the breadbasket of India, but there&#8217;s something unwholesome about the earth here. This country imagines itself in lush green meadows, happy cows chomping on the grass, wooden pails full of pure white milk, vegetarianism, kindness towards all living creatures&#8212;and meanwhile, here in its agricultural heartland, the soil is all dust and famished, full of heavy metals, and the vegetables in the market stalls come scraggly and misshapen, shrivelled onions, anaemic tomatoes, limp scrags of cauliflowers, aubergines already rotting inside before they&#8217;re ripe. Nothing is fruitful. Nothing is plump.</p><p>The people come out the same way. This land mangles its inhabitants. In <em>Tristes Tropiques</em>, L&#233;vi-Strauss sketches out a brief, non-structuralist account of the caste system: India simply has too many people, scratching out a living from a soil exhausted by six thousand years of intensive agriculture. &#8216;When a community becomes too numerous, however great the genius of its thinkers, it can only endure by secreting enslavement. Once men begin to feel cramped in their geographical, social and mental habitat, they are in danger of being tempted by the simple solution of denying one section of the species the right to be considered as human. This allows the rest a little elbow-room for a few more decades. Then it becomes necessary to extend the process of expulsion.&#8217; In the end, you come to twenty-first century Bihar, where outright slavery has swallowed millions. The crowds that push and shove in front of each other are composed of the stunted and the afflicted. People with limbs bent in the wrong direction, joints locked, huge fibrous swellings, graceless zombie-walking, or some with parts of their bodies eaten away, skin asteroid-studded by parasites, withered legs all bone and nothing else, useless flappers for hands, red obliterated feet, some deformed from birth and some bashed or crushed until all the useful tendons and ligaments dissolve into swollen jelly, and some scattered people with their tongues loose, drooling, or looking up in boredom as small flies suck the moisture from the corners of their lips. </p><p>But the worst were the children. As soon as we stepped outside, the children started converging on us. Some of the children are barely five years old, but they wander the streets in pink pyjamas grey with dust, and their hair and faces are dust-grey too. Some of the children carry even younger children around with them, along with empty milk bottles. They walk up to you and start tapping you on the hand, or the thigh, or however high up they can reach, and ask for money. I didn&#8217;t want to give the children any money. Some of the local schools here have banners over the door that say &#8216;DON&#8217;T MAKE THEM BEG&#8212;LET YOUR CHILDREN LEARN,&#8217; but a lot of parents seem to think that making them beg is the more lucrative option, and I didn&#8217;t want to prove them right. Instead, I decided to make a big donation to a charity working with Bihari street children. (I went with one called Rescue Junction; you can support their work <a href=\"https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/support-street-children-in-india/\">here</a>.) But I wasn&#8217;t sure that telling the children I&#8217;d supported a charity that might maybe help someone like them at an unspecified point in the future would really be enough. My girlfriend had the idea of buying some fruit, so we&#8217;d have something to give other than money. I was doubtful: as soon as she offered them a nice apple, I said, they&#8217;d start tapping her wrist even more insistently. No, no fruit, money, money. But we bought some bananas from a street vendor anyway. </p><p>A few children hung around us, watching curiously. The moment she offered the first banana, they surged. Suddenly, my girlfriend was at the centre of a scrum of hungry pleas and snatching hands. She soon stopped even trying to dole out the fruit; she just stood helplessly, holding the bag as dozens of tiny fingers scrabbled through the plastic to grab a fistful of mushy bananas. The whole thing lasted less than thirty seconds, and afterwards the children all loped away without a word. There was only one left, a little boy who hadn&#8217;t managed to get a banana in time. He stood alone in the dust and bawled.</p><p>In the end, I think it would have been much less upsetting if the children had insisted on money instead.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1049706,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A month ago and half a world away, I was lucky enough to spend some of my time in Mumbai with <a href=\"https://kandivalilocal.substack.com/\">Prithvi Pudhiarkar</a>, the poet laureate of Kandivali. (You should start reading him now; that way you can say you were on board before he went global.) Prithvi showed us the austere sacred caves overlooking the skyscrapers of the northern suburbs. The difference between India and the West, he said, is how we deal with suffering. India recognises that suffering is an inextricable part of life. The whole of Indian philosophy and mysticism is an attempt to overcome that suffering through deep mental discipline. You distance yourself from your own senses. Withdraw from the noisy world. The West, meanwhile, has tried to eliminate suffering by crude mechanical means. And in a way, that project has been incredibly successful. Once, the cities of Europe also had open cesspits, marching cripples, five-year-old beggars, and feral pigs eating human shit. Not any more. Back home, the kind of screaming poverty that&#8217;s grinding a hundred million Biharis into the dirt is gone. We&#8217;ve decided that the point of life is to be happy all the time, and so we banished human suffering from the visible realm. No one sees it; everyone publicly pretends that it doesn&#8217;t exist. But it does exist. Suffering really is an inextricable part of human existence; sooner or later, it will come for you, and the West simply has no good way of dealing with it. One of the most visible signs of the social decay in Western countries is opiate addiction. We experience physical or mental suffering and can&#8217;t cope, so we take painkillers, and in the end we get addicted to the act of blotting out our own pain. Prithvi imagined himself visiting me in London, and looking compassionately at all the lost and battered Westerners on the street. Businessmen in raincoats. Freelance programmers. Poor things: their lives are so hard, it really makes you count your blessings; just think, it&#8217;s a pure cosmic fluke that you were born in India and not somewhere miserable like here&#8230;</p><p>I think Prithvi&#8217;s insight is basically true, precisely because it&#8217;s such a big, sweeping generalisation. Yes, the West has a long stoic tradition; yes, the Indian approach to suffering has been part of our philosophy since Schopenhauer, and maybe since Pythagoras; yes, there are plenty of Indians who seem to think they can buy their way out of suffering, from the crorepatis in gilded penthouses to the beggars in the street. It doesn&#8217;t matter. The most boring thing about our age is its urge to nitpick, to needle for counterexamples. But there&#8217;s one counterexample to his thesis that&#8217;s been preying on me here in Bihar, which is the story of King Suddhodana.</p><p>Suddhodana lived around two and a half thousand years ago. The state he ruled was on the hilly, half-civilised fringes of the Gangetic plain, and it wasn&#8217;t really a kingdom. What government existed was carried out by a kind of tribal council of aristocratic warlords; Suddhodana happened to be the most powerful warlord in one particular clan. What matters is that for whatever reason, when his first son was born Suddhodana decided that this boy should get to live a life without any kind of suffering. He shouldn&#8217;t even experience a single negative thought. The prince grew up without ever leaving his father&#8217;s palace, which had been built as a kind of fortress against reality. Inside, everyone was young and beautiful. Any servants who fell ill were instantly dismissed. In the vast, lush gardens, the flowers were constantly uprooted and replaced so they appeared to be blooming all year round. The boy grew up happy, pampered, and stupid. He had never met a human being who wasn&#8217;t there to serve him, and all of them were constantly grinning. He knew the world existed only for his entertainment. He had never encountered sickness, age, or death. Two and a half thousand years ago, on the edge of India, Suddhodana invented the first world.</p><p>It didn&#8217;t work out the way he&#8217;d planned, though. The boy stayed in the walls of his palace until he was a man, twenty-nine years of chocolate for dinner, but eventually he got frustrated with the place. Since frustration is a form of suffering, Suddhodana had to let him go. But he prepared: before the prince left, he had the city cleaned, hung with banners, strewn with petals, and all the ugly people exiled to the hills. When his son emerged from the gate, it was to crowds of beautiful youths maniacally grinning at him. Still, you can&#8217;t sanitise the entire world. Not long into his tour, the price spotted, swaying on the edge of the adoring crowd, a feverish man with his face covered in pustules. In his dumb kindness he tried to rush over and help him, but his servants held him back. They explained that this man was sick, and if the prince came too close he&#8217;d get sick too. Later on there was the shadow of a bent-over crone, toothless and demented, and the prince tried to help her too. His servants were forced to tell him that there was nothing he could do; she was just old. Once, she was young. If you&#8217;re lucky, it&#8217;ll happen to you. When the prince saw a dead body being carried to the cremation pyre, he didn&#8217;t rush over to help this motionless man with his mouth open and his glazed-over eyes. He already knew. Finally, he saw an ascetic sitting emaciated and motionless on the ground, and his servants explained that this was a holy man, who performed gruelling austerities to escape the suffering of the world. Suddenly, the world seemed incredibly full of suffering. The prince decided to leave his father&#8217;s kingdom, renounce the world, and become a wandering ascetic. So he wandered the flat Gangetic plain, and saw suffering. He visited the holy city of Varanasi, where corpses are burned all day and all night by the banks of the Ganges, and saw death. He only ate a single jujube every day; he even tried to stop himself breathing. &#8216;My backside became like a camel's hoof; the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads; my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn.&#8217; Somehow, none of this put an end to the suffering of the world, so after a few years of terrible austerities he started eating again. Eventually he came to a secluded place by the side of a river, and sat under a tree for seven weeks, deep in meditation. After seven weeks, he woke out the sleep he&#8217;d been in his entire life. You know the son of Suddhodana as the Awakened One. The Sanskrit word is <em>Buddha</em>.</p><p>I&#8217;m in this dusty, poisoned town in Bihar because this particular dusty, poisoned town is Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. According to tradition, this ground is sacred: if the prince had his realisation on any other patch of soil, the psychic shockwave unleashed by his ascent to Buddhahood would have torn a hole right through the earth itself. This is why this town is populated by cripples and beggars, who crowd here from every corner of Bihar to coax a few rupees out of the foreign pilgrims. This sacred slum is my last stop: from here, I start the journey back home to London. But without realising it, I&#8217;ve followed the Buddha&#8217;s path, winding along the north Indian plain through Varanasi until I arrived at this particular spot in Bihar. Like the Buddha, I have grown up in a pleasure-palace fortified against reality; like the Buddha, I have seen a lot of things that upset me. Maybe this is the place where I&#8217;ll finally wake up.</p><h4>A sick man: Delhi</h4>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-finale-the-fire-sermon\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

Paid subscribers have joined us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s one last journey in search of the secret that’s been hidden in this country for two and a half thousand years. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from a small town in the lower Ganges valley. This is what everyone tells you to do: get out of the big cities and experience the calm and tranquility of small-town India. I’m just not sure you’re supposed to do it in Bihar. Even my Indian friends were very concerned to learn I was coming here, because among Indians Bihar has the same bad reputation India has in the rest of the world. According to the stereotype, Bihar is flat, dusty, polluted, chaotic, and poor. It has far too many people, and while they’re all wonderful on an individual level, genuine and hardworking, they’re also generally considered to be ignorant, illiterate, toothless, crippled petty criminals who practice rape as a form of light entertainment. Biharis keep migrating to greener, more prosperous parts of India, where they live in shanties and work for drastically lower wages than the locals, who often quickly and violently turn against them. In Bihar itself the bridges keep collapsing, the politicians keep getting arrested for corruption, and the rural population keep committing gory caste massacres in what’s effectively an undeclared civil war. Unfortunately, this stereotype comes with statistics. Bihar is India’s second-largest state, with nearly 130 million people. 89% of them live in rural areas, more than anywhere outside the Himalayas. It has the lowest average income, lowest GDP per capita, and highest poverty rate in the country. If Bihar were an independent country, it would be the tenth largest in the world, with more people than Japan or Mexico. It would also instantly become one of the poorest countries on the planet, behind such beacons of development as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan. A population the size of Russia, forgotten under the belly of the world, and living at the extremes of human misery.\nMy train arrived just before six in the evening, which was a problem. Despite spanning nearly two thousand miles from east to west, India only has one time zone, which means that in the eastern regions it gets dark early, and the one thing everyone had told me about Bihar was that I should not go out at night. There’s no nightlife here. No cocktail bars. People drink, but they drink at home, and mostly just so they can beat their wives. There is no good reason to be on the streets after dark. Stay in your hotel and try not to make too much noise. You should absolutely not attempt to travel overland at night. The countryside teems with throat-slitting bandits, and tourists are routinely robbed. Unfortunately, our hotel was a good long drive from the train station, in a small town upriver surrounded by lots of dark, empty fields. One of my Indian friends told me to watch out for a cop outside the station. If we tried to arrange a lift without a cop’s help, there was a chance the driver would pull into a dark rural track, threaten me and my girlfriend with a knife, take our money and passports, and then leave our bodies by the side of the road. If we asked the policeman to find us a car, this was essentially guaranteed. Afterwards, the cop would get half the take.\nSo as our car squeaked and clattered over an unmarked and barely paved road, I kept the optimal route open on my phone, staring at the blue dot as it moved down along the blue line. As long as we’re on the line, everything’s fine. Nothing will hurt me as long as we’re on the line. It took about five minutes before the driver suddenly veered off it. Now we were on a lightless dirt track surrounded by low and lumpy mud huts. My girlfriend and I looked warily at each other. This is it, I thought. This is the day they’re finally going to hack me to death. We trundled deeper into the backlands, as our driver hummed a benign little tune to himself. I should do something, I thought. I could try to reach over and grab the wheel. I could garrotte him with my shoelace. I could refuse to go quietly. But instead, I noticed, I’m doing nothing. Any second now he’s going to pull over, drag me out the car, and cut me into thin slices with a machete, and I’m doing nothing. I’m watching the blue dot on my phone as it moves further and further in the wrong direction. But it was impossible to imagine that this ordinary car journey would really be what made the sun and the stars go out forever. That I could spend the next five minutes getting mildly carsick by scrolling on Instagram, and then be violently murdered at the end. The genres didn’t match. As long as I keep looking at my phone and doing nothing, I thought, this won’t turn into a struggle to the death in a moving vehicle. Pretend everything’s normal, and maybe I won’t even feel the blow that kills me…\nThe next morning, in the hotel room, I felt a bit silly about the whole thing. Clearly, I’d let myself be influenced by a cruel stereotype about this place. In reality, Bihar might have its struggles, but where doesn’t? It’s still a basically ordinary place, inhabited by basically ordinary people. In fact, we’d met some honeymooning Biharis in the south, and they’d been wonderful. They even gave me their phone number in case I decided to come to Patna. I’ve been in India long enough, I decided; there’s nothing here I haven’t seen before. And then, full of confidence, I went outside.\nThe hotel is on a squiggle of paved road running through the centre of town, loud with the beeping of motorcyclists as they fail to thread their way through the crowds. Away from there, the whole place crumbles into filth. My phone took us on a walk along a street that turned out to have been repurposed as an open sewer, fringed with green slime. Since no one drives down here any more, people have built shanties in the middle of it. They live directly on top of the slurry. Behind the Punjab National Bank there’s an enormous pit of sodden garbage. Black squealing piglets darting around between heaps of plastic and human waste. A corrugated-iron shack is luxury. People live in low hovels made of cow dung. They cook their food over burning cow-dung cakes. It’s a grey land: this is the breadbasket of India, but there’s something unwholesome about the earth here. This country imagines itself in lush green meadows, happy cows chomping on the grass, wooden pails full of pure white milk, vegetarianism, kindness towards all living creatures—and meanwhile, here in its agricultural heartland, the soil is all dust and famished, full of heavy metals, and the vegetables in the market stalls come scraggly and misshapen, shrivelled onions, anaemic tomatoes, limp scrags of cauliflowers, aubergines already rotting inside before they’re ripe. Nothing is fruitful. Nothing is plump.\nThe people come out the same way. This land mangles its inhabitants. In Tristes Tropiques, Lévi-Strauss sketches out a brief, non-structuralist account of the caste system: India simply has too many people, scratching out a living from a soil exhausted by six thousand years of intensive agriculture. ‘When a community becomes too numerous, however great the genius of its thinkers, it can only endure by secreting enslavement. Once men begin to feel cramped in their geographical, social and mental habitat, they are in danger of being tempted by the simple solution of denying one section of the species the right to be considered as human. This allows the rest a little elbow-room for a few more decades. Then it becomes necessary to extend the process of expulsion.’ In the end, you come to twenty-first century Bihar, where outright slavery has swallowed millions. The crowds that push and shove in front of each other are composed of the stunted and the afflicted. People with limbs bent in the wrong direction, joints locked, huge fibrous swellings, graceless zombie-walking, or some with parts of their bodies eaten away, skin asteroid-studded by parasites, withered legs all bone and nothing else, useless flappers for hands, red obliterated feet, some deformed from birth and some bashed or crushed until all the useful tendons and ligaments dissolve into swollen jelly, and some scattered people with their tongues loose, drooling, or looking up in boredom as small flies suck the moisture from the corners of their lips.\nBut the worst were the children. As soon as we stepped outside, the children started converging on us. Some of the children are barely five years old, but they wander the streets in pink pyjamas grey with dust, and their hair and faces are dust-grey too. Some of the children carry even younger children around with them, along with empty milk bottles. They walk up to you and start tapping you on the hand, or the thigh, or however high up they can reach, and ask for money. I didn’t want to give the children any money. Some of the local schools here have banners over the door that say ‘DON’T MAKE THEM BEG—LET YOUR CHILDREN LEARN,’ but a lot of parents seem to think that making them beg is the more lucrative option, and I didn’t want to prove them right. Instead, I decided to make a big donation to a charity working with Bihari street children. (I went with one called Rescue Junction; you can support their work here.) But I wasn’t sure that telling the children I’d supported a charity that might maybe help someone like them at an unspecified point in the future would really be enough. My girlfriend had the idea of buying some fruit, so we’d have something to give other than money. I was doubtful: as soon as she offered them a nice apple, I said, they’d start tapping her wrist even more insistently. No, no fruit, money, money. But we bought some bananas from a street vendor anyway.\nA few children hung around us, watching curiously. The moment she offered the first banana, they surged. Suddenly, my girlfriend was at the centre of a scrum of hungry pleas and snatching hands. She soon stopped even trying to dole out the fruit; she just stood helplessly, holding the bag as dozens of tiny fingers scrabbled through the plastic to grab a fistful of mushy bananas. The whole thing lasted less than thirty seconds, and afterwards the children all loped away without a word. There was only one left, a little boy who hadn’t managed to get a banana in time. He stood alone in the dust and bawled.\nIn the end, I think it would have been much less upsetting if the children had insisted on money instead.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nA month ago and half a world away, I was lucky enough to spend some of my time in Mumbai with Prithvi Pudhiarkar, the poet laureate of Kandivali. (You should start reading him now; that way you can say you were on board before he went global.) Prithvi showed us the austere sacred caves overlooking the skyscrapers of the northern suburbs. The difference between India and the West, he said, is how we deal with suffering. India recognises that suffering is an inextricable part of life. The whole of Indian philosophy and mysticism is an attempt to overcome that suffering through deep mental discipline. You distance yourself from your own senses. Withdraw from the noisy world. The West, meanwhile, has tried to eliminate suffering by crude mechanical means. And in a way, that project has been incredibly successful. Once, the cities of Europe also had open cesspits, marching cripples, five-year-old beggars, and feral pigs eating human shit. Not any more. Back home, the kind of screaming poverty that’s grinding a hundred million Biharis into the dirt is gone. We’ve decided that the point of life is to be happy all the time, and so we banished human suffering from the visible realm. No one sees it; everyone publicly pretends that it doesn’t exist. But it does exist. Suffering really is an inextricable part of human existence; sooner or later, it will come for you, and the West simply has no good way of dealing with it. One of the most visible signs of the social decay in Western countries is opiate addiction. We experience physical or mental suffering and can’t cope, so we take painkillers, and in the end we get addicted to the act of blotting out our own pain. Prithvi imagined himself visiting me in London, and looking compassionately at all the lost and battered Westerners on the street. Businessmen in raincoats. Freelance programmers. Poor things: their lives are so hard, it really makes you count your blessings; just think, it’s a pure cosmic fluke that you were born in India and not somewhere miserable like here…\nI think Prithvi’s insight is basically true, precisely because it’s such a big, sweeping generalisation. Yes, the West has a long stoic tradition; yes, the Indian approach to suffering has been part of our philosophy since Schopenhauer, and maybe since Pythagoras; yes, there are plenty of Indians who seem to think they can buy their way out of suffering, from the crorepatis in gilded penthouses to the beggars in the street. It doesn’t matter. The most boring thing about our age is its urge to nitpick, to needle for counterexamples. But there’s one counterexample to his thesis that’s been preying on me here in Bihar, which is the story of King Suddhodana.\nSuddhodana lived around two and a half thousand years ago. The state he ruled was on the hilly, half-civilised fringes of the Gangetic plain, and it wasn’t really a kingdom. What government existed was carried out by a kind of tribal council of aristocratic warlords; Suddhodana happened to be the most powerful warlord in one particular clan. What matters is that for whatever reason, when his first son was born Suddhodana decided that this boy should get to live a life without any kind of suffering. He shouldn’t even experience a single negative thought. The prince grew up without ever leaving his father’s palace, which had been built as a kind of fortress against reality. Inside, everyone was young and beautiful. Any servants who fell ill were instantly dismissed. In the vast, lush gardens, the flowers were constantly uprooted and replaced so they appeared to be blooming all year round. The boy grew up happy, pampered, and stupid. He had never met a human being who wasn’t there to serve him, and all of them were constantly grinning. He knew the world existed only for his entertainment. He had never encountered sickness, age, or death. Two and a half thousand years ago, on the edge of India, Suddhodana invented the first world.\nIt didn’t work out the way he’d planned, though. The boy stayed in the walls of his palace until he was a man, twenty-nine years of chocolate for dinner, but eventually he got frustrated with the place. Since frustration is a form of suffering, Suddhodana had to let him go. But he prepared: before the prince left, he had the city cleaned, hung with banners, strewn with petals, and all the ugly people exiled to the hills. When his son emerged from the gate, it was to crowds of beautiful youths maniacally grinning at him. Still, you can’t sanitise the entire world. Not long into his tour, the price spotted, swaying on the edge of the adoring crowd, a feverish man with his face covered in pustules. In his dumb kindness he tried to rush over and help him, but his servants held him back. They explained that this man was sick, and if the prince came too close he’d get sick too. Later on there was the shadow of a bent-over crone, toothless and demented, and the prince tried to help her too. His servants were forced to tell him that there was nothing he could do; she was just old. Once, she was young. If you’re lucky, it’ll happen to you. When the prince saw a dead body being carried to the cremation pyre, he didn’t rush over to help this motionless man with his mouth open and his glazed-over eyes. He already knew. Finally, he saw an ascetic sitting emaciated and motionless on the ground, and his servants explained that this was a holy man, who performed gruelling austerities to escape the suffering of the world. Suddenly, the world seemed incredibly full of suffering. The prince decided to leave his father’s kingdom, renounce the world, and become a wandering ascetic. So he wandered the flat Gangetic plain, and saw suffering. He visited the holy city of Varanasi, where corpses are burned all day and all night by the banks of the Ganges, and saw death. He only ate a single jujube every day; he even tried to stop himself breathing. ‘My backside became like a camel's hoof; the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads; my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn.’ Somehow, none of this put an end to the suffering of the world, so after a few years of terrible austerities he started eating again. Eventually he came to a secluded place by the side of a river, and sat under a tree for seven weeks, deep in meditation. After seven weeks, he woke out the sleep he’d been in his entire life. You know the son of Suddhodana as the Awakened One. The Sanskrit word is Buddha.\nI’m in this dusty, poisoned town in Bihar because this particular dusty, poisoned town is Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. According to tradition, this ground is sacred: if the prince had his realisation on any other patch of soil, the psychic shockwave unleashed by his ascent to Buddhahood would have torn a hole right through the earth itself. This is why this town is populated by cripples and beggars, who crowd here from every corner of Bihar to coax a few rupees out of the foreign pilgrims. This sacred slum is my last stop: from here, I start the journey back home to London. But without realising it, I’ve followed the Buddha’s path, winding along the north Indian plain through Varanasi until I arrived at this particular spot in Bihar. Like the Buddha, I have grown up in a pleasure-palace fortified against reality; like the Buddha, I have seen a lot of things that upset me. Maybe this is the place where I’ll finally wake up.\nA sick man: Delhi\nRead more",

This is the international headquarters of the Joyousness Movement, also known as the Joy-Joys, which was founded in California in 1967 and is not a cult. They&#8217;re trying to teach me meditation. I sit on a tatami mat, dressed in scratchy white robes, while an ancient, liver-spotted sub-guru wanders around, giving instructions in his New Jersey croak. When you breathe in, he says, imagine yourself as a flowah. You&#8217;re just a flowah. Feel the lightness of your body: you are a flowah. So I imagine myself as a flower. My body splayed outwards, lacerated into petals. An enormous wet sexual wound at the centre. I imagine myself bursting into cocks. A ring of thick hairy cocks all around my sugar-seeping wound. That&#8217;s a flower, that&#8217;s what a flower is; it&#8217;s the genital organ of a plant. </p><p>I think I might not be cut out for meditation. </p><p>I try to do it the way they&#8217;ve taught me. I try to simply notice these images as they rise to the surface of my consciousness, not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. It&#8217;s hard. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like inside my head. It&#8217;s a tiny place, and it keeps being invaded by a rush of spiky little demons: gnashings of fur and claws, some of them no bigger than flies, razorblades vibrating in the air, emitting stupid phrases in foreign accents, Russian, Chinese, or sometimes just wordless gibbering: my thoughts. At least, I assume they&#8217;re mine. Maybe in the same sense that the bullet that finally gets you is also yours. When they&#8217;re not exploding my body into bits and penises, my thoughts keep up a constant stream of inane bullshit. This meditation posture isn&#8217;t as comfortable as it was half an hour ago, they say. You&#8217;re hungry. You&#8217;re thirsty. You&#8217;re horny. You need to piss. One day, your skin will look like that sub-guru&#8217;s, all creased up like tissue paper, drooping from your spindly arms. And isn&#8217;t it funny to be here, in the depths of India, with so many Americans? </p><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about America in these meditation sessions, whether I want to or not. I&#8217;m thinking about the fact that when Columbus arrived in the New World, he was looking for India. The place he actually found was only an obstacle, a gold-bearing swamp between the man and his destination. The spices and mystery of India, where half-naked holy men sit on mountains and think about nothing. Maybe this is why, when the United States was established, it couldn&#8217;t just sit still in its borders; it had to <em>keep going</em>. Press westward, continue Columbus&#8217;s trajectory, towards California and the sea. &#8216;Passage O soul to India!&#8217; Thoreau reading the <em>Gita</em> in his hut, making Walden pond into his own personal Ganges. Emerson building his new American cosmology out of refashioned scraps from the Vedas. And once the frontier closed, the tough, dusty, knife-fight encampments on that distant coast suddenly became obsessed with Indian spirituality. Reincarnation, past lives, the Universal Mind. The hippie counterculture is just the most recent model. Before that they were making tantric fire-sacrifices at the Jet Propulsion Lab; before that Swami Vivekananda had the state&#8217;s Victorian aristocracy abandoning their chintzy homes to wander the coast as holy beggars. California yearns across the sea, to India. The whole of America is just Europe&#8217;s yearning, across the centuries, for India&#8230;</p><p>The fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam is in the south of the country, sandwiched between Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. For thousands of years, great empires welled up and drained away in the valleys below. The Cholas, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagaras&#8212;while up in their inaccessible hills the Parpakai barely paid any attention. They were far too focused on chewing the mildly psychoactive bark of the tevaiya tree and building weird stone temples with twisting organic forms. Even now, this place is a nightmare to get to, but there is a rail line from Bangalore to Kanturava, the state capital. Every two days, a train clatters and wheezes up the mountains and over the rusting old bridges spanning the ravines. I stood in the vestibule, leaning out the open door, looking down into that sheer sheer drop where the green hills fade into mist. It took sixteen hours before we creaked into the station at Kanturava, the city of terraces and balconies carved into the wall of an enormous cliff, where the ladders have more traffic than the roads. Parpakainilam still barely considers itself part of India. It has the lowest enlistment rate to the Indian Armed Forces of any state, and the lowest voter turnout. None of the national political parties have ever managed to get a foothold here; instead of Congress and the BJP, the Legislative Assembly is split between the Wakefulness Party and the Party of Dreams. Parpakainilam isn&#8217;t even covered by the India Post Office; it has its own informal postal service, based on the ancient kaikku system, in which a letter is passed on, sometimes by hundreds of people, in the vague direction of the recipient. In the more remote regions it can take years to get a postcard, and this ashram is in a very remote region. It&#8217;s a six-hour drive from Kanturava, and after that you have to do the last three hours on foot, through forests and over rope bridges and past ancient stone statues wreathed in vines that inexplicably shoot fire from their mouths when you pass. It was not a nice journey. But I made here, to the White Hermitage Ashram in its damp valley, to learn about Indian mysticism and spirituality from the people who understand it best&#8212;that is, from Americans.</p><p>A day at the White Hermitage Ashram begins at five in the morning with two hours of guided meditation. After that, there&#8217;s a fire ceremony in which we worship the Universal Mind, incarnated as a marble statue of Guru Raj Hansi as he looked in the late 60s, long hair, long trailing beard, big handsome wide-open face. Then a simple, traditional ashram breakfast of foot loops and cap&#8217;n crunch, served with milk from the ashram cows and tevaiya bark for chewing, eaten in silence. After that, there&#8217;s six hours of uninterrupted work. Sweeping, cleaning, mucking out the cattle, hosing down the toilets, washing clothes, running the ashram&#8217;s social media accounts. (I keep asking to help with the animals; they keep forcing me to sit in a stuffy, windowless room and tweet.) At two in the afternoon we sit together and eat lunch, usually a big bag of crisps with more tevaiya. The next four hours are for personal reflection, meditation, study, and informal group exercises, before another aarti, a silent dinner of lentil burgers or tofu dogs, and bed. But it used to be very different. The White Hermitage Ashram is huge. Its dining hall is huge, its kitchens are huge, its laundry looks like an industrial operation. There are housing units in this valley ten storeys high. At its peak in the 1970s, there were six thousand people living, working, and praying here. Back then, before Guru Raj Hansi went into seclusion, a good chunk of the day was taken up by gurudarshan: thousands of Joy-Joys would arrange themselves around the Guru, radiantly nude, and just stare at him, enraptured, soaking up the blissful energies that radiated from his silent, smiling form. Then he would say a few, simple words. Joy is not something you are seeking, he would say. Joy is already here. This was usually followed by an enormous session of ecstatic group sex. The Joyousness Movement was casting off five thousand years of shame and jealousy. They were finding the joy bursting out everywhere from the look, the touch, the feeling of warm skin against your own. Sex is a form of meditation, one of the most powerful forms of meditation. Through pleasure or procreation, sex dissolves you into the great stream of being; it&#8217;s through sex that you can come to understand the first mahavakya, <em>tat tvam asi</em>, thou art that. You are the existent, you are the universal self, you are everything and everyone. Fall into an ocean of firm, tanned, supple flesh, without questioning whether this flesh you&#8217;re touching belongs to a friend, a stranger, a man, a woman, an adult, a child&#8230;</p><p>Apparently they do still have sexual meditation at the White Hermitage Ashram, but I haven&#8217;t seen any. Today there are about fifty Joy-Joys still here, and they are not as firm and tanned and supple as they were. They creak around the place in their orange robes, with trembling hands and purple blotches on their skin, and the ashram is in ruins. We eat in one tiny corner of the dining hall. The machinery in the laundry is all gummed up, leaking toxic sludge; we wash our clothes in the river. Trees are growing out of the roofs of the high-rises, as their roots slowly crack the concrete open. All the young sexy kids back in America are still into spirituality, but it&#8217;s a very different kind. Taylor Swift has not yet started making pop songs based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Sabrina Carpenter is not singing about how the physical universe is an illusion. The kids might still do yoga and say namaste, and they still think there&#8217;s a universal consciousness that&#8217;s ultimately identical with their own self&#8212;but they&#8217;re no longer interested in renouncing desire or achieving union with the divine. They don&#8217;t want to escape the material world. They don&#8217;t want enlightenment. They are driving their bodies like cars, and they have no interest in getting out. At no point do you have to go on any kind of pilgrimage to India. It&#8217;s all about manifesting: using the fact that you&#8217;re a facet of the Infinite Mind to <em>get the stuff you want</em>. More money, more Instagram followers. The question isn&#8217;t why Westerners became obsessed with Indian spirituality: it&#8217;s why we stopped.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-8-love-is-all\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

I sit on a tatami mat, dressed in scratchy white robes, while an ancient, liver-spotted sub-guru wanders around, giving instructions in his New Jersey croak. When you breathe in, he says, imagine yourself as a flowah. You’re just a flowah. Feel the lightness of your body: you are a flowah. So I imagine myself as a flower. My body splayed outwards, lacerated into petals. An enormous wet sexual wound at the centre. I imagine myself bursting into cocks. A ring of thick hairy cocks all around my sugar-seeping wound. That’s a flower, that’s what a flower is; it’s the genital organ of a plant.\nI think I might not be cut out for meditation.\nI try to do it the way they’ve taught me. I try to simply notice these images as they rise to the surface of my consciousness, not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. It’s hard. You don’t know what it’s like inside my head. It’s a tiny place, and it keeps being invaded by a rush of spiky little demons: gnashings of fur and claws, some of them no bigger than flies, razorblades vibrating in the air, emitting stupid phrases in foreign accents, Russian, Chinese, or sometimes just wordless gibbering: my thoughts. At least, I assume they’re mine. Maybe in the same sense that the bullet that finally gets you is also yours. When they’re not exploding my body into bits and penises, my thoughts keep up a constant stream of inane bullshit. This meditation posture isn’t as comfortable as it was half an hour ago, they say. You’re hungry. You’re thirsty. You’re horny. You need to piss. One day, your skin will look like that sub-guru’s, all creased up like tissue paper, drooping from your spindly arms. And isn’t it funny to be here, in the depths of India, with so many Americans?\nI’ve been thinking a lot about America in these meditation sessions, whether I want to or not. I’m thinking about the fact that when Columbus arrived in the New World, he was looking for India. The place he actually found was only an obstacle, a gold-bearing swamp between the man and his destination. The spices and mystery of India, where half-naked holy men sit on mountains and think about nothing. Maybe this is why, when the United States was established, it couldn’t just sit still in its borders; it had to keep going. Press westward, continue Columbus’s trajectory, towards California and the sea. ‘Passage O soul to India!’ Thoreau reading the Gita in his hut, making Walden pond into his own personal Ganges. Emerson building his new American cosmology out of refashioned scraps from the Vedas. And once the frontier closed, the tough, dusty, knife-fight encampments on that distant coast suddenly became obsessed with Indian spirituality. Reincarnation, past lives, the Universal Mind. The hippie counterculture is just the most recent model. Before that they were making tantric fire-sacrifices at the Jet Propulsion Lab; before that Swami Vivekananda had the state’s Victorian aristocracy abandoning their chintzy homes to wander the coast as holy beggars. California yearns across the sea, to India. The whole of America is just Europe’s yearning, across the centuries, for India…\nThe fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam is in the south of the country, sandwiched between Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. For thousands of years, great empires welled up and drained away in the valleys below. The Cholas, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagaras—while up in their inaccessible hills the Parpakai barely paid any attention. They were far too focused on chewing the mildly psychoactive bark of the tevaiya tree and building weird stone temples with twisting organic forms. Even now, this place is a nightmare to get to, but there is a rail line from Bangalore to Kanturava, the state capital. Every two days, a train clatters and wheezes up the mountains and over the rusting old bridges spanning the ravines. I stood in the vestibule, leaning out the open door, looking down into that sheer sheer drop where the green hills fade into mist. It took sixteen hours before we creaked into the station at Kanturava, the city of terraces and balconies carved into the wall of an enormous cliff, where the ladders have more traffic than the roads. Parpakainilam still barely considers itself part of India. It has the lowest enlistment rate to the Indian Armed Forces of any state, and the lowest voter turnout. None of the national political parties have ever managed to get a foothold here; instead of Congress and the BJP, the Legislative Assembly is split between the Wakefulness Party and the Party of Dreams. Parpakainilam isn’t even covered by the India Post Office; it has its own informal postal service, based on the ancient kaikku system, in which a letter is passed on, sometimes by hundreds of people, in the vague direction of the recipient. In the more remote regions it can take years to get a postcard, and this ashram is in a very remote region. It’s a six-hour drive from Kanturava, and after that you have to do the last three hours on foot, through forests and over rope bridges and past ancient stone statues wreathed in vines that inexplicably shoot fire from their mouths when you pass. It was not a nice journey. But I made here, to the White Hermitage Ashram in its damp valley, to learn about Indian mysticism and spirituality from the people who understand it best—that is, from Americans.\nA day at the White Hermitage Ashram begins at five in the morning with two hours of guided meditation. After that, there’s a fire ceremony in which we worship the Universal Mind, incarnated as a marble statue of Guru Raj Hansi as he looked in the late 60s, long hair, long trailing beard, big handsome wide-open face. Then a simple, traditional ashram breakfast of foot loops and cap’n crunch, served with milk from the ashram cows and tevaiya bark for chewing, eaten in silence. After that, there’s six hours of uninterrupted work. Sweeping, cleaning, mucking out the cattle, hosing down the toilets, washing clothes, running the ashram’s social media accounts. (I keep asking to help with the animals; they keep forcing me to sit in a stuffy, windowless room and tweet.) At two in the afternoon we sit together and eat lunch, usually a big bag of crisps with more tevaiya. The next four hours are for personal reflection, meditation, study, and informal group exercises, before another aarti, a silent dinner of lentil burgers or tofu dogs, and bed. But it used to be very different. The White Hermitage Ashram is huge. Its dining hall is huge, its kitchens are huge, its laundry looks like an industrial operation. There are housing units in this valley ten storeys high. At its peak in the 1970s, there were six thousand people living, working, and praying here. Back then, before Guru Raj Hansi went into seclusion, a good chunk of the day was taken up by gurudarshan: thousands of Joy-Joys would arrange themselves around the Guru, radiantly nude, and just stare at him, enraptured, soaking up the blissful energies that radiated from his silent, smiling form. Then he would say a few, simple words. Joy is not something you are seeking, he would say. Joy is already here. This was usually followed by an enormous session of ecstatic group sex. The Joyousness Movement was casting off five thousand years of shame and jealousy. They were finding the joy bursting out everywhere from the look, the touch, the feeling of warm skin against your own. Sex is a form of meditation, one of the most powerful forms of meditation. Through pleasure or procreation, sex dissolves you into the great stream of being; it’s through sex that you can come to understand the first mahavakya, tat tvam asi, thou art that. You are the existent, you are the universal self, you are everything and everyone. Fall into an ocean of firm, tanned, supple flesh, without questioning whether this flesh you’re touching belongs to a friend, a stranger, a man, a woman, an adult, a child…\nApparently they do still have sexual meditation at the White Hermitage Ashram, but I haven’t seen any. Today there are about fifty Joy-Joys still here, and they are not as firm and tanned and supple as they were. They creak around the place in their orange robes, with trembling hands and purple blotches on their skin, and the ashram is in ruins. We eat in one tiny corner of the dining hall. The machinery in the laundry is all gummed up, leaking toxic sludge; we wash our clothes in the river. Trees are growing out of the roofs of the high-rises, as their roots slowly crack the concrete open. All the young sexy kids back in America are still into spirituality, but it’s a very different kind. Taylor Swift has not yet started making pop songs based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Sabrina Carpenter is not singing about how the physical universe is an illusion. The kids might still do yoga and say namaste, and they still think there’s a universal consciousness that’s ultimately identical with their own self—but they’re no longer interested in renouncing desire or achieving union with the divine. They don’t want to escape the material world. They don’t want enlightenment. They are driving their bodies like cars, and they have no interest in getting out. At no point do you have to go on any kind of pilgrimage to India. It’s all about manifesting: using the fact that you’re a facet of the Infinite Mind to get the stuff you want. More money, more Instagram followers. The question isn’t why Westerners became obsessed with Indian spirituality: it’s why we stopped.\nRead more",

It&#8217;s beautiful out, and I&#8217;m writing this in my swimming trunks while sipping a non-alcoholic mojito that includes, for some reason, little specks of sushi ginger floating around with the sprigs of mint. In a moment I&#8217;m going to go and get another of the best meals I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, which I will eat with my hands directly off a banana leaf. I&#8217;m enjoying a kind of holiday from my holiday, and if you&#8217;ve been following this series you&#8217;ll understand why I deserve one. (Thanks to everyone who successfully campaigned for my release; no thanks at all to the thousands of people who apparently thought my being arrested and sent to Indian jail was some kind of literary bit.) It&#8217;s nice here. I hear there&#8217;s been a cold snap back in London. I&#8217;m having an extremely nice time. </p><p>It took me three days to get down here from Mumbai, chugging along pretty much the entire length of peninsular India. When I did arrive, it was like arriving in another country. Down to the language: in the north, I&#8217;d got very used to the cadences of Hindi and Bengali and Marathi, which are all very rhythmic, rising and falling on the vowels, gummed together with consonants, <em>aapke aagey jaadu chalta hai</em>. I might not understand the words, but it&#8217;s audibly part of the same linguistic universe I come from, some distant relative of English. Here in Kerala they speak Malayalam, which is about as different from both English and Hindi as the click languages of Africa, or the Amazonian grammars where a noun&#8217;s declension depends on whether you saw it while entering or leaving the village, or the Siberian tundra-wails in which every verb has one million possible forms. In Malayalam, there are words like <em>vaidyuthiaagamanagamananiyanthranayanthram</em>, which is an electric switch. The capital of Kerala is called Thiruvananthapuram. All these words are written in a very beautiful script, which looks &#3335;&#3364;&#3393;&#3370;&#3403;&#3378;&#3398;. The round, flowing forms are because Malayalam was originally written by being cut into palm leaves with a stylus, and straight lines would have torn through the fibres. Before I arrived here, though, I was wondering how any of this would actually be pronounced&#8212;up to and including the word <em>Malayalam</em> itself, which my tongue tends to slip around on like a bad ice skater. (Malayam? Mayalayalam? It&#8217;s not just me with this problem. Other Indians default to calling the people here Mallus, which is sometimes taken as an offensive slur, but it is objectively easier.) The answer is that these words are pronounced all at once. Instead of enunciating every syllable, <em>Thi-ru-va-nan-tha-pu-ram</em>, you just mash your jaw up and down while emitting a fast rhythmic bubbling sound. It is utterly unlike anything else I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.</p><p>But everything is different here. In the north, cities and towns are scrunched fibrous cysts. Narrow brick houses packed together in the dust, all reeking of diesel fumes. Here, they sprawl. A Keralite town is more like an American suburb: big low homes with pitched roofs, dotted between wide expanses of lushly watered green. Another thing it will probably share with an American suburb is a huge gaudy church: Kerala has six million Christians, nearly a fifth of the state&#8217;s population. Also the steakhouse: in the north  of India cattle slaughter is illegal; in Kerala, even Hindus eat quite a lot of beef. But the resemblance ends there. In most of India, like most of the world, modernisation means <em>Westernisation</em>. This is why Delhi has artisan coffee shops with raw plaster on the walls, and Mumbai has some great small-plates restaurants, and every dusty town in Uttar Pradesh has a whole range of vegetarian burger bars. But Kerala is clearly guided by a different light. A white and gold aesthetic predominates. It&#8217;s hard to get a drink outside a few tourist hotels, but there are plenty of shisha bars. The fancy shops have signs in two languages: Malayalam and Arabic. Street food means dosas and uttapams but also, increasingly, shawarma. A lot of restaurants have two branches: one in Ernakulam, one in Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Kerala has always been the part of India most open to the rest of the world. Its Christian community was founded when the disciple Thomas sailed here to preach to the already long-established community of Malabar Jews. According to tradition, the first mosque in Kerala was built while Mohammed was still in exile in Medina. When Vasco de Gama arrived in India, he arrived here. So did the Dutch and the British. Today, that openness has led to a massive flow of migrant workers, remittances, health tourists, and cultural influence back and forth between Kerala and the UAE. The result is a version of India that&#8217;s visibly Christian but also Gulf Arab-flavoured. It&#8217;s also, incidentally, governed by the Communist Party, which has covered every city and every town in red hammer-and-sickle banners. At the market, the fresh fruit is sold on yesterday&#8217;s newspaper, which features a big double-page profile of Friedrich Engels, including a full explication of the <em>Naturdialektik</em> in Malayalam. It&#8217;s a weird place.</p><p>Kerala rarely comes up as a communist success story. I find this weird, since the seventy-odd years of intermittent communist government have clearly served the place well, without at any point involving any bread lines or nameless thousands shot and buried in shallow graves. Maybe this place has escaped the world&#8217;s attention because the communists in Kerala have had to do all their work in local government, where it&#8217;s harder to even <em>try</em> to abolish the value-form. Instead, they&#8217;re forced to simply administer capitalism, but it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism <em>well</em>, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party. </p><p>Before the first communist government, a good chunk of the rural population were essentially slaves; meanwhile free peasants had to give over up to 75% of their crop to their landlords. The class struggle that followed was not bloodless. Across the state, there are monuments to peasant leaders murdered by landlords during the land reform campaign. A lot of people were hacked to death in their fields; in the end the Indian government decided that the communist programme was too radical, dismissed the elected state government, and declared direct rule from Delhi. But in the end the peasants won, and today Kerala has the lowest rural poverty rate in India, under 1%. The communists empowered trade unions, and today wages here are higher than anywhere else in the country. The average Indian farmworker makes just over 300 rupees a day; in Kerala it&#8217;s more like 800. </p><p>This has led to some problems. India as a whole is growing fast, but economic growth in Kerala is sclerotic, barely above first world-level, and the state has a hard time attracting capital. (This makes sense: as a good capitalist, would you prefer to build a factory in Bihar, where desperate peasants will beg you for a job, or in Kerala, where labour costs three times as much, your workers will immediately start scheming for your surplus, and the local government won&#8217;t even bash their heads in for you but might even back them up?) But there&#8217;s one other thing that communism has historically done extremely well, which is to provide an ideological structure that efficiently mobilises urban elites to go out into the countryside and provide healthcare and education to the rural poor. (Under noncommunist ideologies they usually go for a more well-remunerated but less socially useful version, like setting up an NGO to deliver corporate trainings on social equity.) The result is a huge surplus of well-educated Keralites, and like any other surplus in a well-run capitalist economy it ends up being exported abroad. </p><p>The UAE runs on Malayali engineers. In Britain, our NHS essentially parasites itself off the communist school system of Kerala.

Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s about holy poverty and why the West is actually much more conformist than India. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from a beach in Kerala. It’s beautiful out, and I’m writing this in my swimming trunks while sipping a non-alcoholic mojito that includes, for some reason, little specks of sushi ginger floating around with the sprigs of mint. In a moment I’m going to go and get another of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life, which I will eat with my hands directly off a banana leaf. I’m enjoying a kind of holiday from my holiday, and if you’ve been following this series you’ll understand why I deserve one. (Thanks to everyone who successfully campaigned for my release; no thanks at all to the thousands of people who apparently thought my being arrested and sent to Indian jail was some kind of literary bit.) It’s nice here. I hear there’s been a cold snap back in London. I’m having an extremely nice time.\nIt took me three days to get down here from Mumbai, chugging along pretty much the entire length of peninsular India. When I did arrive, it was like arriving in another country. Down to the language: in the north, I’d got very used to the cadences of Hindi and Bengali and Marathi, which are all very rhythmic, rising and falling on the vowels, gummed together with consonants, aapke aagey jaadu chalta hai. I might not understand the words, but it’s audibly part of the same linguistic universe I come from, some distant relative of English. Here in Kerala they speak Malayalam, which is about as different from both English and Hindi as the click languages of Africa, or the Amazonian grammars where a noun’s declension depends on whether you saw it while entering or leaving the village, or the Siberian tundra-wails in which every verb has one million possible forms. In Malayalam, there are words like vaidyuthiaagamanagamananiyanthranayanthram, which is an electric switch. The capital of Kerala is called Thiruvananthapuram. All these words are written in a very beautiful script, which looks ഇതുപോലെ. The round, flowing forms are because Malayalam was originally written by being cut into palm leaves with a stylus, and straight lines would have torn through the fibres. Before I arrived here, though, I was wondering how any of this would actually be pronounced—up to and including the word Malayalam itself, which my tongue tends to slip around on like a bad ice skater. (Malayam? Mayalayalam? It’s not just me with this problem. Other Indians default to calling the people here Mallus, which is sometimes taken as an offensive slur, but it is objectively easier.) The answer is that these words are pronounced all at once. Instead of enunciating every syllable, Thi-ru-va-nan-tha-pu-ram, you just mash your jaw up and down while emitting a fast rhythmic bubbling sound. It is utterly unlike anything else I’ve ever heard in my life.\nBut everything is different here. In the north, cities and towns are scrunched fibrous cysts. Narrow brick houses packed together in the dust, all reeking of diesel fumes. Here, they sprawl. A Keralite town is more like an American suburb: big low homes with pitched roofs, dotted between wide expanses of lushly watered green. Another thing it will probably share with an American suburb is a huge gaudy church: Kerala has six million Christians, nearly a fifth of the state’s population. Also the steakhouse: in the north of India cattle slaughter is illegal; in Kerala, even Hindus eat quite a lot of beef. But the resemblance ends there. In most of India, like most of the world, modernisation means Westernisation. This is why Delhi has artisan coffee shops with raw plaster on the walls, and Mumbai has some great small-plates restaurants, and every dusty town in Uttar Pradesh has a whole range of vegetarian burger bars. But Kerala is clearly guided by a different light. A white and gold aesthetic predominates. It’s hard to get a drink outside a few tourist hotels, but there are plenty of shisha bars. The fancy shops have signs in two languages: Malayalam and Arabic. Street food means dosas and uttapams but also, increasingly, shawarma. A lot of restaurants have two branches: one in Ernakulam, one in Abu Dhabi.\nKerala has always been the part of India most open to the rest of the world. Its Christian community was founded when the disciple Thomas sailed here to preach to the already long-established community of Malabar Jews. According to tradition, the first mosque in Kerala was built while Mohammed was still in exile in Medina. When Vasco de Gama arrived in India, he arrived here. So did the Dutch and the British. Today, that openness has led to a massive flow of migrant workers, remittances, health tourists, and cultural influence back and forth between Kerala and the UAE. The result is a version of India that’s visibly Christian but also Gulf Arab-flavoured. It’s also, incidentally, governed by the Communist Party, which has covered every city and every town in red hammer-and-sickle banners. At the market, the fresh fruit is sold on yesterday’s newspaper, which features a big double-page profile of Friedrich Engels, including a full explication of the Naturdialektik in Malayalam. It’s a weird place.\nKerala rarely comes up as a communist success story. I find this weird, since the seventy-odd years of intermittent communist government have clearly served the place well, without at any point involving any bread lines or nameless thousands shot and buried in shallow graves. Maybe this place has escaped the world’s attention because the communists in Kerala have had to do all their work in local government, where it’s harder to even try to abolish the value-form. Instead, they’re forced to simply administer capitalism, but it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.\nBefore the first communist government, a good chunk of the rural population were essentially slaves; meanwhile free peasants had to give over up to 75% of their crop to their landlords. The class struggle that followed was not bloodless. Across the state, there are monuments to peasant leaders murdered by landlords during the land reform campaign. A lot of people were hacked to death in their fields; in the end the Indian government decided that the communist programme was too radical, dismissed the elected state government, and declared direct rule from Delhi. But in the end the peasants won, and today Kerala has the lowest rural poverty rate in India, under 1%. The communists empowered trade unions, and today wages here are higher than anywhere else in the country. The average Indian farmworker makes just over 300 rupees a day; in Kerala it’s more like 800.\nThis has led to some problems. India as a whole is growing fast, but economic growth in Kerala is sclerotic, barely above first world-level, and the state has a hard time attracting capital. (This makes sense: as a good capitalist, would you prefer to build a factory in Bihar, where desperate peasants will beg you for a job, or in Kerala, where labour costs three times as much, your workers will immediately start scheming for your surplus, and the local government won’t even bash their heads in for you but might even back them up?) But there’s one other thing that communism has historically done extremely well, which is to provide an ideological structure that efficiently mobilises urban elites to go out into the countryside and provide healthcare and education to the rural poor. (Under noncommunist ideologies they usually go for a more well-remunerated but less socially useful version, like setting up an NGO to deliver corporate trainings on social equity.) The result is a huge surplus of well-educated Keralites, and like any other surplus in a well-run capitalist economy it ends up being exported abroad.\nThe UAE runs on Malayali engineers. In Britain, our NHS essentially parasites itself off the communist school system of Kerala. The revolutionary workers and peasants toil for universal education, and that education is realised in an oil despot’s thirtieth mansion or a few pills for a Scouse granny’s gammy knee. In return, of course, a chunk of the much higher foreign wages ends up coming back here, so people can live well in their green God-fearing suburb with Arab aesthetics and Communist slogans on all the walls. It’s not perfect, but it works.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nI think this is not the India a lot of people are thinking about when they think about India.\nThis country has an image problem.

Siddique had been a councillor in the Municipal Corporation and a minister of state in the Maharashtra government; he&#8217;d sat on any number of important committees; he founded a political dynasty. He was gunned down by the Bishnoi gang outside his son&#8217;s constituency office for reasons unknown. Last time, I said I didn&#8217;t even know who Baba Siddique was until he was assassinated last month, and that&#8217;s true. Even so&#8212;and my lawyer has begged me not to write this bit, but my first duty is always to the truth&#8212;I&#8217;m not entirely innocent either. This is how I ended up here, and what happened next.</p><p>You have to understand what coming to Mumbai was like. For weeks, I&#8217;d been trudging around various dusty, dilapidated towns in Rajasthan, dutifully checking in on the historic palaces and the historic forts and the historic palaces inside the historic forts, half of them ruined, with bats hanging from the rafters and guano piling the floor where the tyrants of a less squalid age had once piled their gold and silks. I ate in godawful tourist restaurants with extensive menus full of burgers and fries. These people would have been horrified to discover what a burger really is, but that didn&#8217;t stop them selling any number of slimes between two buns under the name. I dodged tuktuks and human shit on narrow streets with no pavements, just a fringe of dust and heaped-up plastic, where I couldn&#8217;t walk for ten seconds without someone blocking my path&#8212;yes my friend! you want shopping? you want spend money?&#8212;proffering fake pashmina scarves or plastic idols or camel leather handbags or sometimes more ordinary things when there was nothing else to hawk, handfuls of broken masonry or bits of wood, biro caps, long ribbons of apple peel: yes my friend, you want pulp, you want chalk, you want worms? It&#8217;s a decaying world up there. Rajasthan is the most traditional, hidebound part of the country, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re interested in actually conserving the things they&#8217;ve received from the past, just that all they know how to do is moulder away. Brits and Israelis keep flocking to see the old forts and palaces, even if those forts are surrounded by a broad moat of filth; no need to live in anything other than comfortable squalor. Let it rot; all rot is picturesque. </p><p>Anyway, try to imagine what it was like for me to start the day in a dusty Rajasthani town on the edge of the desert, and arrive that evening in Mumbai. To drive down the Coastal Road and just see skyscrapers, hundreds of spindles of light all along the shore of the Arabian Sea, and more of them further inland, visible in the gaps between, thousands more: a city that <em>keeps going</em>, glittering endlessly for miles into the haze, and all of it superdense, all crushed and glowing like a neutron star. The hypercity; South Asia&#8217;s only real metropolis. In a country of one and a half billion people, this one city produces more than a third of the total tax revenue. Delhi might be big, in a strictly demographic sense, but it feels like a hypertrophied version of a poky little town. Mumbai feels <em>extraplanetary</em>. It keeps on going across the bay, into the sprawling warehouses of Navi Mumbai, liquid urban stuff flooding the hinterlands of Maharashtra; it keeps going beyond our world. Across asteroids and exoplanets there are tracts of slum housing and salvage zones, chipped signs in Hindi and Marathi in the warrens where bony stunted children take apart starships for scrap, street hawkers scurrying under skies with two suns or none at all. Coming here was like being dragged facefirst across the centuries, from the ruins of the eighteenth to the furnace of the twenty-third. </p><p>As soon as you see the skyscrapers, Mumbai&#8217;s famous slums make perfect sense. All of India floods into this one city, and I get it. If you were a Bihari peasant farmer, scraping dust out of the dust, shitting in a communal ditch, sleeping in the same one-room hut as your goats, as your ancestors had scraped and shat and slept for five thousand years&#8212;but you knew that you lived in the same country as Mumbai, this science-fiction city bursting with money and danger, you&#8217;d have to be an idiot not to go. So they come here, to live in slums. There&#8217;s no neighbourhood in Mumbai so ritzy it doesn&#8217;t have its slums. Malabar Hill has them, swelling like boils in between the towers. This is where all the energy of the city is generated. An overflowing pool of dirt-cheap labour, flooding into the cracks. Bataille once noted that nature is in constant high tension, exploding extravagantly: cut a path through a grassy field and new plants will immediately start growing in the bare earth. But you only get this rich fecundity when every individual organism is desperately poor, on the point of starvation, gasping for space in a saturated world. Mumbai is the same. If there&#8217;s six square feet of land along a railway track, or behind the back of some luxury mall, or in the gaps between office towers, someone&#8217;s already put up a lopsided corrugated-iron shack. Or, more likely, ten of them, a hundred, crammed together, sharing zero toilets. Whole families in a room, half the size of the one they shared with the goats back home.</p><p>But obviously not everyone here lives like grass. The fifty thousand dollar millionaires in this city, and the millions more in the comfortable middle classes, get to prance around in the meadow. It&#8217;s easy not to see the misery here if you don&#8217;t want to: I was too entranced by how nice it felt to be in a real city again. Mumbai has pavements. It has a big monumental downtown, partially built by the British, but mostly built by the local commercial classes in a high Victorian style. Gothic clock towers, all niches and gables. Neoclassical fountains featuring allegorical sculptures of nude women with tiny European tits, to represent Industry and Thrift and Cleanliness and Sexual Repression. Mumbai has a Zara and a Uniqlo and it&#8217;s even got Pret A Manger. Supermarkets too. Not a street market, not mud-crusted plastic buckets full of fly-crawling fruit, not skinned lambs dangling from their collarbones in the street, but shelves full of hygienically packaged products, all plastic-smooth. I could have been in Tesco. In fact, I was: the Star Bazaar supermarket chain is a 50-50 joint venture between the Tata Group and Tesco plc. And maybe it was the weird familiarity of this place that made me act out.</p><p>What you need to know is that Lawrence Bishnoi is currently India&#8217;s most feared gangster. He&#8217;s the man who orchestrated the murder of Baba Siddique; he&#8217;s also, according to the police, my boss. Bishnoi took the usual route into organised crime, which is to be born into the kind of respectable middle-class family that names its children after colonial-era British administrators, and then enter the underworld via the medium of student politics. While he was studying at Punjab University, Bishnoi ran for the student council and lost; next time, he realised that instead of risking another ordinary campaign, he could just threaten to kill anyone who voted the other way. He won, and was then promptly arrested. His time in jail changed his goals but not his strategy. This is how the Bishoi gang works: pure extortion. They don&#8217;t smuggle drugs, they don&#8217;t traffic women, they don&#8217;t make loans or organise illegal gambling; they just demand money and threaten to kill you if you don&#8217;t pay up. Sometimes, it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;ll kill you for other reasons. Bishnoi has vowed to kill the Bollywood actor Salman Khan over a 1998 poaching incident in which Khan shot an antelope. Lawrence Bishnoi comes from the Bishnoi panth, a caste of deeply religious tree-huggers from Rajasthan. In 1730, the Maharaja of Marwar sent soldiers to fell trees near a Bishnoi village for a new palace. Hundreds of villagers each wrapped their arms around a tree: if you want to cut this down, you&#8217;ll have to cut through me too. So they did: more than three hundred Bishnoi were sawn in half defending their trees. The Bishnoi worship all the gods, but they have a particular reverence for Agyana, god of blissful ignorance, and the antelope is his mount. Which is why, three hundred years later, Lawrence Bishnoi&#8217;s men fired a volley of gunshots at Salman Khan&#8217;s house. At least, that&#8217;s the official reason. But in the entertainment industry, nothing is what it seems. Not so long ago, everyone in Bollywood was gleefully murdering each other. Big men, famous men, shot down in the street so some actor could get out of a contract he didn&#8217;t like, or to secure international distribution rights for a frothy romance film with lots of song-and-dance numbers. And just when it looked like the bloodshed was finally winding down, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang moved into town with a laminated menu of execution methods, hired assassins to the stars. And now Bishnoi is killing politicians. Baba Siddique, local kingmaker, gunned down in the middle of Mumbai. Beyond that, things get too murky to see. According to the government of Canada, Indian intelligence is using the Bishnoi gang to murder Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. Bishnoi&#8217;s graduated into a greater game now, the game that produces the thing we call the world. </p><p>The police aren&#8217;t looking for Lawrence Bishnoi. They&#8217;ve already found him. For the last nine years, he&#8217;s directed his gang&#8217;s rise to supremacy in the Indian underworld from a cell in Sabermati Jail in Gujarat. Apparently, the authorities are powerless to stop him.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2087793,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My own criminal history is less exciting, but when I was younger, I went through a shoplifting phase. Everyone does it, I&#8217;d tell myself, waddling out of Waterstones with a book in each armpit. Everything should belong to everyone, I&#8217;d think, scurrying out the supermarket with a big wedge of purloined cheese. Emerging from H&amp;M wearing four ugly shirts at once and a pair of sunglasses stuffed in my left sock, I&#8217;d reason that if they didn&#8217;t want me to steal this stuff, they should have simply caught me before I took it. I&#8217;m not proud of myself, but to be honest I&#8217;m not really that ashamed either. I was young and broke, and then I grew up a bit and stopped. What I am ashamed of are the thoughts I started having as I dutifully poked around the Hindu temples of the north. As I mentioned last time, my Jewish upbringing made me strangely uncomfortable with all the images and icons; what I didn&#8217;t tell you was that every time I saw some faithful doddering old man leave a ten-rupee note in front of the black figure of some god, I had a sudden and intense urge to just <em>grab it</em>. What did this idol need with money? Why not me instead? Obviously it would be unthinkable to actually do it: to come to a much poorer country and nakedly steal from its people: I wanted to believe that we British were actually past that sort of thing. But in Mumbai&#8212;some of the people in this place are <em>rich</em>. </p><p>In Malabar Hill I had a good gawp at Antilia, a private skyscraper one hundred and seventy metres tall, where Mukesh Ambani and his family live among floating badminton courts and six-storey elephant stables and an aquarium extending the entire height of the building for their beloved minke whale. Outside, the police have parked an actual tank. The soldiers guarding the naval port and military headquarters all have rusty old Russian rifles, but outside Antilia the cops are twitching with nasty little Belgian and Austrian submachine guns, all lasers and silencers and spectroscopic sights, ready to perforate any prole in sight at the first sign of trouble. Later, in a nearby temple, I watched a man in a moustache and a combover plonk down a slim but respectable stack of five-hundred-rupee notes in front of the god. The statue of Agyana, seated beatifically on his antelope, didn&#8217;t seem to acknowledge the gift, and when the bald man left I didn&#8217;t even think. I made the justifications to myself later, though. This holiday isn&#8217;t cheap, and unlike my big trip last year it doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;ll pay for itself. My subscribers are a good 30% less interested in the India series than my one on China, and whose fault is that? Not <em>mine</em>. My writing is impeccable. It&#8217;s this country&#8217;s fault, for failing to fascinate Western audiences to the same degree, and aren&#8217;t I owed some compensation? It took about an hour before my bullshit started to wear thin, and I decided to give the whole stack to the first beggar I saw. But it was only as I was counting out the notes that I noticed the little slip of paper folded within. It said:</p><div class=\"preformatted-block\" data-component-name=\"PreformattedTextBlockToDOM\"><label class=\"hide-text\" contenteditable=\"false\">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class=\"text\"><em>Hello Sam\nWe see you\nWe know what you&#8217;ve done\nBe outside Building Number 35, Kherwadi, Bandra East, Mumbai 400051.

The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s about the Upanishads of the underworld. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m once again writing from my jail cell in Mumbai, where I’ve been accused of being a footsoldier in the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, personally responsible for the recent murder of local political legend Baba Siddique. Siddique had been a councillor in the Municipal Corporation and a minister of state in the Maharashtra government; he’d sat on any number of important committees; he founded a political dynasty. He was gunned down by the Bishnoi gang outside his son’s constituency office for reasons unknown. Last time, I said I didn’t even know who Baba Siddique was until he was assassinated last month, and that’s true. Even so—and my lawyer has begged me not to write this bit, but my first duty is always to the truth—I’m not entirely innocent either. This is how I ended up here, and what happened next.\nYou have to understand what coming to Mumbai was like. For weeks, I’d been trudging around various dusty, dilapidated towns in Rajasthan, dutifully checking in on the historic palaces and the historic forts and the historic palaces inside the historic forts, half of them ruined, with bats hanging from the rafters and guano piling the floor where the tyrants of a less squalid age had once piled their gold and silks. I ate in godawful tourist restaurants with extensive menus full of burgers and fries. These people would have been horrified to discover what a burger really is, but that didn’t stop them selling any number of slimes between two buns under the name. I dodged tuktuks and human shit on narrow streets with no pavements, just a fringe of dust and heaped-up plastic, where I couldn’t walk for ten seconds without someone blocking my path—yes my friend! you want shopping? you want spend money?—proffering fake pashmina scarves or plastic idols or camel leather handbags or sometimes more ordinary things when there was nothing else to hawk, handfuls of broken masonry or bits of wood, biro caps, long ribbons of apple peel: yes my friend, you want pulp, you want chalk, you want worms? It’s a decaying world up there. Rajasthan is the most traditional, hidebound part of the country, but that doesn’t mean they’re interested in actually conserving the things they’ve received from the past, just that all they know how to do is moulder away. Brits and Israelis keep flocking to see the old forts and palaces, even if those forts are surrounded by a broad moat of filth; no need to live in anything other than comfortable squalor. Let it rot; all rot is picturesque.\nAnyway, try to imagine what it was like for me to start the day in a dusty Rajasthani town on the edge of the desert, and arrive that evening in Mumbai. To drive down the Coastal Road and just see skyscrapers, hundreds of spindles of light all along the shore of the Arabian Sea, and more of them further inland, visible in the gaps between, thousands more: a city that keeps going, glittering endlessly for miles into the haze, and all of it superdense, all crushed and glowing like a neutron star. The hypercity; South Asia’s only real metropolis. In a country of one and a half billion people, this one city produces more than a third of the total tax revenue. Delhi might be big, in a strictly demographic sense, but it feels like a hypertrophied version of a poky little town. Mumbai feels extraplanetary. It keeps on going across the bay, into the sprawling warehouses of Navi Mumbai, liquid urban stuff flooding the hinterlands of Maharashtra; it keeps going beyond our world. Across asteroids and exoplanets there are tracts of slum housing and salvage zones, chipped signs in Hindi and Marathi in the warrens where bony stunted children take apart starships for scrap, street hawkers scurrying under skies with two suns or none at all. Coming here was like being dragged facefirst across the centuries, from the ruins of the eighteenth to the furnace of the twenty-third.\nAs soon as you see the skyscrapers, Mumbai’s famous slums make perfect sense. All of India floods into this one city, and I get it. If you were a Bihari peasant farmer, scraping dust out of the dust, shitting in a communal ditch, sleeping in the same one-room hut as your goats, as your ancestors had scraped and shat and slept for five thousand years—but you knew that you lived in the same country as Mumbai, this science-fiction city bursting with money and danger, you’d have to be an idiot not to go. So they come here, to live in slums. There’s no neighbourhood in Mumbai so ritzy it doesn’t have its slums. Malabar Hill has them, swelling like boils in between the towers. This is where all the energy of the city is generated. An overflowing pool of dirt-cheap labour, flooding into the cracks. Bataille once noted that nature is in constant high tension, exploding extravagantly: cut a path through a grassy field and new plants will immediately start growing in the bare earth. But you only get this rich fecundity when every individual organism is desperately poor, on the point of starvation, gasping for space in a saturated world. Mumbai is the same. If there’s six square feet of land along a railway track, or behind the back of some luxury mall, or in the gaps between office towers, someone’s already put up a lopsided corrugated-iron shack. Or, more likely, ten of them, a hundred, crammed together, sharing zero toilets. Whole families in a room, half the size of the one they shared with the goats back home.\nBut obviously not everyone here lives like grass. The fifty thousand dollar millionaires in this city, and the millions more in the comfortable middle classes, get to prance around in the meadow. It’s easy not to see the misery here if you don’t want to: I was too entranced by how nice it felt to be in a real city again. Mumbai has pavements. It has a big monumental downtown, partially built by the British, but mostly built by the local commercial classes in a high Victorian style. Gothic clock towers, all niches and gables. Neoclassical fountains featuring allegorical sculptures of nude women with tiny European tits, to represent Industry and Thrift and Cleanliness and Sexual Repression. Mumbai has a Zara and a Uniqlo and it’s even got Pret A Manger. Supermarkets too. Not a street market, not mud-crusted plastic buckets full of fly-crawling fruit, not skinned lambs dangling from their collarbones in the street, but shelves full of hygienically packaged products, all plastic-smooth. I could have been in Tesco. In fact, I was: the Star Bazaar supermarket chain is a 50-50 joint venture between the Tata Group and Tesco plc. And maybe it was the weird familiarity of this place that made me act out.\nWhat you need to know is that Lawrence Bishnoi is currently India’s most feared gangster. He’s the man who orchestrated the murder of Baba Siddique; he’s also, according to the police, my boss. Bishnoi took the usual route into organised crime, which is to be born into the kind of respectable middle-class family that names its children after colonial-era British administrators, and then enter the underworld via the medium of student politics. While he was studying at Punjab University, Bishnoi ran for the student council and lost; next time, he realised that instead of risking another ordinary campaign, he could just threaten to kill anyone who voted the other way. He won, and was then promptly arrested. His time in jail changed his goals but not his strategy. This is how the Bishoi gang works: pure extortion. They don’t smuggle drugs, they don’t traffic women, they don’t make loans or organise illegal gambling; they just demand money and threaten to kill you if you don’t pay up. Sometimes, it’s true, they’ll kill you for other reasons. Bishnoi has vowed to kill the Bollywood actor Salman Khan over a 1998 poaching incident in which Khan shot an antelope. Lawrence Bishnoi comes from the Bishnoi panth, a caste of deeply religious tree-huggers from Rajasthan. In 1730, the Maharaja of Marwar sent soldiers to fell trees near a Bishnoi village for a new palace. Hundreds of villagers each wrapped their arms around a tree: if you want to cut this down, you’ll have to cut through me too. So they did: more than three hundred Bishnoi were sawn in half defending their trees. The Bishnoi worship all the gods, but they have a particular reverence for Agyana, god of blissful ignorance, and the antelope is his mount. Which is why, three hundred years later, Lawrence Bishnoi’s men fired a volley of gunshots at Salman Khan’s house. At least, that’s the official reason. But in the entertainment industry, nothing is what it seems. Not so long ago, everyone in Bollywood was gleefully murdering each other. Big men, famous men, shot down in the street so some actor could get out of a contract he didn’t like, or to secure international distribution rights for a frothy romance film with lots of song-and-dance numbers. And just when it looked like the bloodshed was finally winding down, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang moved into town with a laminated menu of execution methods, hired assassins to the stars. And now Bishnoi is killing politicians. Baba Siddique, local kingmaker, gunned down in the middle of Mumbai. Beyond that, things get too murky to see. According to the government of Canada, Indian intelligence is using the Bishnoi gang to murder Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. Bishnoi’s graduated into a greater game now, the game that produces the thing we call the world.\nThe police aren’t looking for Lawrence Bishnoi. They’ve already found him. For the last nine years, he’s directed his gang’s rise to supremacy in the Indian underworld from a cell in Sabermati Jail in Gujarat. Apparently, the authorities are powerless to stop him.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMy own criminal history is less exciting, but when I was younger, I went through a shoplifting phase. Everyone does it, I’d tell myself, waddling out of Waterstones with a book in each armpit. Everything should belong to everyone, I’d think, scurrying out the supermarket with a big wedge of purloined cheese. Emerging from H&M wearing four ugly shirts at once and a pair of sunglasses stuffed in my left sock, I’d reason that if they didn’t want me to steal this stuff, they should have simply caught me before I took it. I’m not proud of myself, but to be honest I’m not really that ashamed either. I was young and broke, and then I grew up a bit and stopped. What I am ashamed of are the thoughts I started having as I dutifully poked around the Hindu temples of the north. As I mentioned last time, my Jewish upbringing made me strangely uncomfortable with all the images and icons; what I didn’t tell you was that every time I saw some faithful doddering old man leave a ten-rupee note in front of the black figure of some god, I had a sudden and intense urge to just grab it. What did this idol need with money? Why not me instead? Obviously it would be unthinkable to actually do it: to come to a much poorer country and nakedly steal from its people: I wanted to believe that we British were actually past that sort of thing. But in Mumbai—some of the people in this place are rich.\nIn Malabar Hill I had a good gawp at Antilia, a private skyscraper one hundred and seventy metres tall, where Mukesh Ambani and his family live among floating badminton courts and six-storey elephant stables and an aquarium extending the entire height of the building for their beloved minke whale. Outside, the police have parked an actual tank. The soldiers guarding the naval port and military headquarters all have rusty old Russian rifles, but outside Antilia the cops are twitching with nasty little Belgian and Austrian submachine guns, all lasers and silencers and spectroscopic sights, ready to perforate any prole in sight at the first sign of trouble. Later, in a nearby temple, I watched a man in a moustache and a combover plonk down a slim but respectable stack of five-hundred-rupee notes in front of the god. The statue of Agyana, seated beatifically on his antelope, didn’t seem to acknowledge the gift, and when the bald man left I didn’t even think. I made the justifications to myself later, though. This holiday isn’t cheap, and unlike my big trip last year it doesn’t look like it’ll pay for itself. My subscribers are a good 30% less interested in the India series than my one on China, and whose fault is that? Not mine. My writing is impeccable. It’s this country’s fault, for failing to fascinate Western audiences to the same degree, and aren’t I owed some compensation? It took about an hour before my bullshit started to wear thin, and I decided to give the whole stack to the first beggar I saw. But it was only as I was counting out the notes that I noticed the little slip of paper folded within. It said:\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Hello Sam\nWe see you\nWe know what you’ve done\nBe outside Building Number 35, Kherwadi, Bandra East, Mumbai 400051. Tonight. 9 pm. Come alone.\nHE IS BEYOND KNOWLEDGE AND INCOMPREHENSION\nAfter my arrest, I tried to tell Detective Shiv Vaktashirana of the Mumbai Crime Branch what happened next.\nRead more",

In fact, before I was arrested I&#8217;d written a fair amount about Mumbai, featuring several brilliant insights. (Did you know that this city is very large? And that its people include both the extremely rich and the extremely poor?) It&#8217;ll have to wait. In the meantime, last weekend was Diwali, India&#8217;s biggest festival. Outside, I&#8217;m sure, there were diyas flickering on every windowsill, the whole endless metropolis glowing with a warm and welcoming light: from the glass windows of the skyscrapers, from the reeking holes in the slums. I&#8217;m sure the sky was bright with fireworks. I&#8217;m sure everyone danced in the streets. But where I am, the only light comes from a single fluorescent tube, and it&#8217;s been buzzing with its stark grey pallor ever since they threw me in here. No candles or dancing in my windowless cell, but I still get to hear the firecrackers. For maybe one hundred hours over the Diwali weekend there were constant firecrackers, maybe one every three seconds. As far as I can tell&#8212;although I can&#8217;t tell much from in here&#8212;people are setting off these things entirely at random. While waiting for the bus, strolling out of a restaurant, in the middle of the day, sitting in the park, fielding in a cricket game&#8212;chuck a firecracker: bang. The sound is muffled through the concrete but I can still hear every single one of them. Like gunshots. Apparently, when Baba Siddique was assassinated, he was idly throwing firecrackers on the street. The shots that killed him melted into the general din. You could hide an entire war in this city and nobody would know.</p><p>Everyone knows that Diwali is about celebrating the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. As meanings go, this is not very impressive. (A religion that upholds good over evil? Does your culture also value food and hospitality?) But if it sounds generic, that&#8217;s because it is. Officially, Diwali doesn&#8217;t actually commemorate anything in particular. In the south of India, it celebrates the time Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In Bengal, it celebrates the time Kali defeated the demon Raktabija. India, famously, has a lot of gods. But if you spend any amount of time here, it becomes clear that these days there&#8217;s only one, and the other gods have become a kind of supporting cast around him. Outside a few scattered minor cults, the god of India is Lord Ram. I&#8217;ve been to any number of Hindu temples notionally dedicated to Lakshmi or Ganesh, with a female or elephant-headed shape in the garbhagriha, but through the loudspeakers dotted around the place disembodied voices continually chant <em>Jai Shri Ram</em>. That same phrase has become a Hindu nationalist rallying cry; it&#8217;s what the mobs shout when they burn Muslim neighbourhoods. And for the majority of this country, Diwali is about Ram too: it celebrates his return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after his fourteen years of exile, in which he defeated the demon Ravana. (Defeating demons is a big deal here.) The story of Ram is deeply ingrained in this country: most people will never read the <em>Ramayana</em>, and a lot of Hindus have a very vague sense of their own religion, but this particular narrative is the scaffolding that supports the world. Ram, the hero, the perfect man. Sita, the perfect bride. Ravana, who contains every evil. Outsiders can try to study Hinduism through its vast archive of holy texts, the hoary chants of the Vedas, the philosophical Upanishads, the weird and brilliant stories of the Puranas, or maybe through yoga, meditation, spiritual communion&#8212;but the real core of it is that everyone knows the story of Ram and Sita before they can walk. This narrative is in the blood, like microplastics. Which is a shame, because once you strip away the poetry of the ancient text, the story of Ram is a very insipid fairytale.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-5-jai-shri-tv\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

As far as I can tell—although I can’t tell much from in here—people are setting off these things entirely at random. While waiting for the bus, strolling out of a restaurant, in the middle of the day, sitting in the park, fielding in a cricket game—chuck a firecracker: bang. The sound is muffled through the concrete but I can still hear every single one of them. Like gunshots. Apparently, when Baba Siddique was assassinated, he was idly throwing firecrackers on the street. The shots that killed him melted into the general din. You could hide an entire war in this city and nobody would know.\nEveryone knows that Diwali is about celebrating the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. As meanings go, this is not very impressive. (A religion that upholds good over evil? Does your culture also value food and hospitality?) But if it sounds generic, that’s because it is. Officially, Diwali doesn’t actually commemorate anything in particular. In the south of India, it celebrates the time Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In Bengal, it celebrates the time Kali defeated the demon Raktabija. India, famously, has a lot of gods. But if you spend any amount of time here, it becomes clear that these days there’s only one, and the other gods have become a kind of supporting cast around him. Outside a few scattered minor cults, the god of India is Lord Ram. I’ve been to any number of Hindu temples notionally dedicated to Lakshmi or Ganesh, with a female or elephant-headed shape in the garbhagriha, but through the loudspeakers dotted around the place disembodied voices continually chant Jai Shri Ram. That same phrase has become a Hindu nationalist rallying cry; it’s what the mobs shout when they burn Muslim neighbourhoods. And for the majority of this country, Diwali is about Ram too: it celebrates his return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after his fourteen years of exile, in which he defeated the demon Ravana. (Defeating demons is a big deal here.) The story of Ram is deeply ingrained in this country: most people will never read the Ramayana, and a lot of Hindus have a very vague sense of their own religion, but this particular narrative is the scaffolding that supports the world. Ram, the hero, the perfect man. Sita, the perfect bride. Ravana, who contains every evil. Outsiders can try to study Hinduism through its vast archive of holy texts, the hoary chants of the Vedas, the philosophical Upanishads, the weird and brilliant stories of the Puranas, or maybe through yoga, meditation, spiritual communion—but the real core of it is that everyone knows the story of Ram and Sita before they can walk. This narrative is in the blood, like microplastics. Which is a shame, because once you strip away the poetry of the ancient text, the story of Ram is a very insipid fairytale.\nRead more",

As everyone knows, one of them contains all the smart people, the academics, the professionals, the people who&#8217;ve read the studies, learned the science, educated themselves, who eat well and own nice things made of wood, the good little boys and girls who know what&#8217;s best for everyone. It&#8217;s not polite to say this about the other side, but everyone is secretly aware that they are&#8212;let&#8217;s be honest here&#8212;morons. Actual imbeciles, breathing through the spittle in their mouths. Glassy-eyed religious maniacs. Frothing adult virgins with their heads full of Y-DNA charts and built-up cum. Uncomfortably globular men who have unknowingly outsourced their entire sense of reality to Kenyan scammers generating engagement-bait with ChatGPT. If you talk to these people for even a few minutes, it becomes clear there&#8217;s something very seriously wrong with them. Instead of articulate speech, they produce a constant stream of meaningless drivel, mashed-up waste syllables, usually referring to some podcaster, political nobody, or minor advertising campaign that no one whose life is worth living has ever heard of. A good chunk of them have reverted to a magical, Stone Age account of the universe, in which everything that happens, including ordinary weather events, is part of a Plan set in motion by Them, to distract you. Distract you from what? It&#8217;s not clear, but the idiot&#8217;s eyes are constantly shifting around from object to object and screen to screen, darting with the terror of a primitive in a defensive crouch against a world he simply doesn&#8217;t have the faculties to understand. Because this faction is so stupid and offputting, its political party is deeply unpopular. In fact, it&#8217;s only won the popular vote in a Presidential election two times since 1988. The first time was in 2004, when the entire country was in the middle of a psychotic war fever, ravenous for blood, crazy in a way that&#8217;s difficult to imagine now. The Disney channel used to broadcast little idents of teen celebs, gushing about how much they loved the American flag. The other time they won was the other day. It wasn&#8217;t even close. Somehow, the imbeciles outsmarted the smartest people in the world. And I said this would happen. Not to gloat, but: I told you so. I told you so. I told you so. </p><p>Look:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"769\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:769,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:156279,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>One of my most foundational political beliefs is that while the winner in an election doesn&#8217;t usually deserve to win, the loser always deserves to lose. I can&#8217;t think of anyone who deserved to lose more than Kamala Harris.</p><p>According to the Democratic Party, the election they just lost in a humiliating landslide was the most important election in anyone&#8217;s lifetime, a last-ditch effort to protect democracy itself from Trump&#8217;s incipient authoritarianism. Out of the entire population, they could only choose one person to be their champion, to go head-to-head against Donald Trump and stop his new fascist cacocracy from becoming reality. The lives and welfare of millions&#8212;billions!&#8212;depended on their making the right choice. And who did they pick? One of the least popular politicians in the country, the goofy cackling woman who says things like &#8216;It is time to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day,&#8217; who seems mildly but permanently xanned, who moves through the world like a pat of half-melted butter. For the Democrats to lose one election to Donald Trump by nominating an obviously terrible candidate is an honest mistake. Two, and something&#8217;s up. The question isn&#8217;t why Harris lost to Trump&#8212;why was she ever in a position to lose to him in the first place?</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Kamala Harris is not an untalented politician. In fact, she&#8217;s a very good one, but unfortunately that&#8217;s all she&#8217;s good at. Her parents do seem like genuinely interesting people. Donald Harris is a Jamaican development economist and one of only a handful of people to have received his country&#8217;s Order of Merit; the others include Bob Marley, Derek Walcott, and Fidel Castro. Shyamala Gopalan Harris was a Tam-Brahm from Madras who moved to America to research the genetics of breast cancer. Not exactly the kind of hardscrabble immigrant background that plays well in America, but it&#8217;s not boring either. The couple met through the Black Panthers. Cool! But maybe coming to America was a mistake, because in America everything is tinsel-thin, and in America even students of the historical dialectic can produce a daughter who goes around giving unrequited commencement speeches on what can be, unburdened by what has been. Kamala was not good at school, not particularly talented at university, and when she defaulted to law school she wasn&#8217;t particularly stellar there either. But at Howard she was pouting around with the girls at Alpha Kappa Alpha, which was apparently the swaggiest, brown-paper-baggiest sorority on campus, and at Hastings Law School she was the head of the Black Law Students Association. She was good at the game, making connections, leveraging them, getting ahead. After law school she spent a few years dating California political legend Willie Brown, and while it might not be fair to say that&#8217;s the only explanation for her political success, he can&#8217;t exactly have hurt. She got herself into enough of the right circles to jump from District Attorney to Attorney General to the Senate. Her world kept getting bigger; by 2003 she was calling Willie Brown &#8216;the albatross hanging around my neck.&#8217; By all accounts, she&#8217;s a charismatic schmoozer, but deeply tyrannical to anyone unlucky enough to find themselves among her underlings. In 2020 she ran for President. She can&#8217;t have possibly thought she would win. It was Joe Biden&#8217;s year, the result was already written, and she was a two-year Senator with no actual achievements to her name. But it was a smart move: raise her profile, make her talents known, and after dropping out she could leverage her way into some kind of juicy post. Keep on climbing. She&#8217;s a very good politician.</p><p>The one thing missing from this story, though, is the electorate. Kamala Harris isn&#8217;t good with electorates. She&#8217;s a machine politician. She wants power, but not for any particular reason. It&#8217;s just that life is a game, and the point is to reach the highest level. Sidle your way into a series of darker and smokier rooms. When she ran for Attorney General in 2010 she secured endorsements from Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but in the end she beat her Republican opponent by less than one percentage point&#8212;in <em>California</em>, which hasn&#8217;t elected a Republican AG in thirty years. When she dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary, it was still 2019. She was polling as close to 0% as makes no difference, and had not actually contested a single state. But why bother? For politicians like Harris, the people are just another annoying hurdle on the road to success. And she was right. History intervened. Nobody knew it at the time, but it turned out that the 2020 election was held in the fateful year of 2020, which meant that Biden was essentially obliged to pick a black woman as his running mate. (A lot of people seem to remember him explicitly promising to do so, which he didn&#8217;t; he promised to put a black woman&#8212;any black woman, apparently&#8212;on the Supreme Court. This sort of thing was normal at the time.) Of all the black women available, Harris was the obvious choice. She wouldn&#8217;t make trouble. She knew how to play the game. She was a well-functioning part of a well-functioning machine.</p><p>The reason Kamala Harris lost is the same as the reason she was the candidate to begin with: the Democratic Party is allergic to democracy. It&#8217;s the instrument of a particular form of class power; its role is basically disciplinary. When it comes to an actual crisis, all it knows how to do is coil in on itself, breathe in its own fumes, suck itself off until completion. The party knew that Joe Biden&#8217;s brains kept running out of his nose and into his morning coffee, but they kept pretending until it was far too late that he was running laps around the White House lawn and solving new problems in theoretical physics in his spare time. They really seemed to think that people wouldn&#8217;t notice what was right in front of them. Maybe they simply didn&#8217;t care. When people <em>did</em> notice, when Biden stretched his arm too wide at the first debate and all the stuffing came out, the party made sure his overthrow and replacement went as smoothly and as seamlessly as possible. No messy primaries, no ideological bickering, just a slick, stage-managed show. They&#8217;re very good at politics too.</p><p>Do you remember Brat Summer? I remember Brat Summer. It was genuinely amazing, one of the most bizarre mass psychological phenomena I&#8217;ve ever seen. Before a clock spring popped out of Joe Biden&#8217;s forehead on live TV, Kamala Harris was the least popular Vice President in recent US history. There were a lot of reasons for this, but I think the big ones are these. Firstly, she was already deeply unpopular&#8212;0% polls, remember&#8212;before she became VP. Secondly, she&#8217;d done absolutely nothing with the position except emit strange and incomprehensible bromides whenever she opened her mouth. But as soon as she became the candidate, despite nothing about her actually changing, her approval rating skyrocketed. It turns out that all you have to do is tell the Democratic base that they ought to like someone, and they&#8217;ll just start liking her. I think this is evidence of an extraordinary generosity of spirit. All of us, and me especially, could learn something from them. But it was incredible to watch. All these pols and pundits, who had been so stiff and serious in the gloom of the Biden era, suddenly breaking out in virulent lime green. Like a new tropical disease ripping through the establishment. Doughy old columnists transformed overnight into thirteen-year-old girls in shiny lipgloss. <em>Ew. You&#8217;re, like, totally weird.</em> Somehow this career politician, born when parts of Africa still belonged to the British Empire, turned overnight into some kind of snotty egirl. The <em>New York Times</em> printed the words &#8216;coconut-pilled,&#8217; along with an op-ed about how she embodied the principle of &#8216;black joy.&#8217; Sure, it was all vibes, but the vibes were good. In Gaza, they were lining up dozens of people in the courtyards of hospitals and crushing them to death with bulldozers, but that was all very far away.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nThere are two factions in American politics, and they’re not evenly matched. As everyone knows, one of them contains all the smart people, the academics, the professionals, the people who’ve read the studies, learned the science, educated themselves, who eat well and own nice things made of wood, the good little boys and girls who know what’s best for everyone. It’s not polite to say this about the other side, but everyone is secretly aware that they are—let’s be honest here—morons. Actual imbeciles, breathing through the spittle in their mouths. Glassy-eyed religious maniacs. Frothing adult virgins with their heads full of Y-DNA charts and built-up cum. Uncomfortably globular men who have unknowingly outsourced their entire sense of reality to Kenyan scammers generating engagement-bait with ChatGPT. If you talk to these people for even a few minutes, it becomes clear there’s something very seriously wrong with them. Instead of articulate speech, they produce a constant stream of meaningless drivel, mashed-up waste syllables, usually referring to some podcaster, political nobody, or minor advertising campaign that no one whose life is worth living has ever heard of. A good chunk of them have reverted to a magical, Stone Age account of the universe, in which everything that happens, including ordinary weather events, is part of a Plan set in motion by Them, to distract you. Distract you from what? It’s not clear, but the idiot’s eyes are constantly shifting around from object to object and screen to screen, darting with the terror of a primitive in a defensive crouch against a world he simply doesn’t have the faculties to understand. Because this faction is so stupid and offputting, its political party is deeply unpopular. In fact, it’s only won the popular vote in a Presidential election two times since 1988. The first time was in 2004, when the entire country was in the middle of a psychotic war fever, ravenous for blood, crazy in a way that’s difficult to imagine now. The Disney channel used to broadcast little idents of teen celebs, gushing about how much they loved the American flag. The other time they won was the other day. It wasn’t even close. Somehow, the imbeciles outsmarted the smartest people in the world. And I said this would happen. Not to gloat, but: I told you so. I told you so. I told you so.\nLook:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOne of my most foundational political beliefs is that while the winner in an election doesn’t usually deserve to win, the loser always deserves to lose. I can’t think of anyone who deserved to lose more than Kamala Harris.\nAccording to the Democratic Party, the election they just lost in a humiliating landslide was the most important election in anyone’s lifetime, a last-ditch effort to protect democracy itself from Trump’s incipient authoritarianism. Out of the entire population, they could only choose one person to be their champion, to go head-to-head against Donald Trump and stop his new fascist cacocracy from becoming reality. The lives and welfare of millions—billions!—depended on their making the right choice. And who did they pick? One of the least popular politicians in the country, the goofy cackling woman who says things like ‘It is time to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day,’ who seems mildly but permanently xanned, who moves through the world like a pat of half-melted butter. For the Democrats to lose one election to Donald Trump by nominating an obviously terrible candidate is an honest mistake. Two, and something’s up. The question isn’t why Harris lost to Trump—why was she ever in a position to lose to him in the first place?\nSubscribe now\nKamala Harris is not an untalented politician. In fact, she’s a very good one, but unfortunately that’s all she’s good at. Her parents do seem like genuinely interesting people. Donald Harris is a Jamaican development economist and one of only a handful of people to have received his country’s Order of Merit; the others include Bob Marley, Derek Walcott, and Fidel Castro. Shyamala Gopalan Harris was a Tam-Brahm from Madras who moved to America to research the genetics of breast cancer. Not exactly the kind of hardscrabble immigrant background that plays well in America, but it’s not boring either. The couple met through the Black Panthers. Cool! But maybe coming to America was a mistake, because in America everything is tinsel-thin, and in America even students of the historical dialectic can produce a daughter who goes around giving unrequited commencement speeches on what can be, unburdened by what has been. Kamala was not good at school, not particularly talented at university, and when she defaulted to law school she wasn’t particularly stellar there either. But at Howard she was pouting around with the girls at Alpha Kappa Alpha, which was apparently the swaggiest, brown-paper-baggiest sorority on campus, and at Hastings Law School she was the head of the Black Law Students Association. She was good at the game, making connections, leveraging them, getting ahead. After law school she spent a few years dating California political legend Willie Brown, and while it might not be fair to say that’s the only explanation for her political success, he can’t exactly have hurt. She got herself into enough of the right circles to jump from District Attorney to Attorney General to the Senate. Her world kept getting bigger; by 2003 she was calling Willie Brown ‘the albatross hanging around my neck.’ By all accounts, she’s a charismatic schmoozer, but deeply tyrannical to anyone unlucky enough to find themselves among her underlings. In 2020 she ran for President. She can’t have possibly thought she would win. It was Joe Biden’s year, the result was already written, and she was a two-year Senator with no actual achievements to her name. But it was a smart move: raise her profile, make her talents known, and after dropping out she could leverage her way into some kind of juicy post. Keep on climbing. She’s a very good politician.\nThe one thing missing from this story, though, is the electorate. Kamala Harris isn’t good with electorates. She’s a machine politician. She wants power, but not for any particular reason. It’s just that life is a game, and the point is to reach the highest level. Sidle your way into a series of darker and smokier rooms. When she ran for Attorney General in 2010 she secured endorsements from Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but in the end she beat her Republican opponent by less than one percentage point—in California, which hasn’t elected a Republican AG in thirty years. When she dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary, it was still 2019. She was polling as close to 0% as makes no difference, and had not actually contested a single state. But why bother? For politicians like Harris, the people are just another annoying hurdle on the road to success. And she was right. History intervened. Nobody knew it at the time, but it turned out that the 2020 election was held in the fateful year of 2020, which meant that Biden was essentially obliged to pick a black woman as his running mate. (A lot of people seem to remember him explicitly promising to do so, which he didn’t; he promised to put a black woman—any black woman, apparently—on the Supreme Court. This sort of thing was normal at the time.) Of all the black women available, Harris was the obvious choice. She wouldn’t make trouble. She knew how to play the game. She was a well-functioning part of a well-functioning machine.\nThe reason Kamala Harris lost is the same as the reason she was the candidate to begin with: the Democratic Party is allergic to democracy. It’s the instrument of a particular form of class power; its role is basically disciplinary. When it comes to an actual crisis, all it knows how to do is coil in on itself, breathe in its own fumes, suck itself off until completion. The party knew that Joe Biden’s brains kept running out of his nose and into his morning coffee, but they kept pretending until it was far too late that he was running laps around the White House lawn and solving new problems in theoretical physics in his spare time. They really seemed to think that people wouldn’t notice what was right in front of them. Maybe they simply didn’t care. When people did notice, when Biden stretched his arm too wide at the first debate and all the stuffing came out, the party made sure his overthrow and replacement went as smoothly and as seamlessly as possible. No messy primaries, no ideological bickering, just a slick, stage-managed show. They’re very good at politics too.\nDo you remember Brat Summer? I remember Brat Summer. It was genuinely amazing, one of the most bizarre mass psychological phenomena I’ve ever seen. Before a clock spring popped out of Joe Biden’s forehead on live TV, Kamala Harris was the least popular Vice President in recent US history. There were a lot of reasons for this, but I think the big ones are these. Firstly, she was already deeply unpopular—0% polls, remember—before she became VP. Secondly, she’d done absolutely nothing with the position except emit strange and incomprehensible bromides whenever she opened her mouth. But as soon as she became the candidate, despite nothing about her actually changing, her approval rating skyrocketed. It turns out that all you have to do is tell the Democratic base that they ought to like someone, and they’ll just start liking her. I think this is evidence of an extraordinary generosity of spirit. All of us, and me especially, could learn something from them. But it was incredible to watch. All these pols and pundits, who had been so stiff and serious in the gloom of the Biden era, suddenly breaking out in virulent lime green. Like a new tropical disease ripping through the establishment. Doughy old columnists transformed overnight into thirteen-year-old girls in shiny lipgloss. Ew. You’re, like, totally weird. Somehow this career politician, born when parts of Africa still belonged to the British Empire, turned overnight into some kind of snotty egirl. The New York Times printed the words ‘coconut-pilled,’ along with an op-ed about how she embodied the principle of ‘black joy.’ Sure, it was all vibes, but the vibes were good. In Gaza, they were lining up dozens of people in the courtyards of hospitals and crushing them to death with bulldozers, but that was all very far away. Wasn’t it fun, now that Old Man Biden was gone and you could play with your brand-new Kamala doll as much as you like? But for some unaccountable reason, among the general public, ‘Kamala: You Already Like Her!’ was not the brilliant pitch it seemed to be.\nHard to blame her, though; it’s not like she had many other choices. She became Vice President in a cultural atmosphere in which her historic status as a black woman was a potential vote-winner, in which you could bludgeon people into supporting you—or, at least, not opposing you—by suggesting that they’re bigots if they don’t play along. A lot can change in four years. Bigotry is actually kinda in right now. Another option would be to actually offer something to the voters. Some prospect that she could maybe make their lives better. That’s what Trump did: he offered an enemy to blame and the prospect of doing violence to them. Not a bad deal.

You have to give them your love and respect and admiration and, crucially, your vote. Otherwise the monster wins.\nWhich is the line they reverted to, once Brat Summer faded. Blackmail: democracy is on the ballot. Project 2025. The Republican plot to steal your pronouns. Fascism on the horizon. All of which might be real: Donald Trump exists within the purely instinctive life, a kind of wafting meditative state in which everything is possible. He can levitate a few inches off the ground; he is capable of extreme evil. Last time, he tried to overturn the result of a democratic election, which is very bad juju.

This city was founded in 1156 by the Bhati, a Rajput clan pushed into the desert from their Afghan heartland by waves of invaders from the steppe. According to Orlando, for the people of Jaisalmer not much has changed since. Don&#8217;t be fooled by their clothes, he told me. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the fact that they&#8217;ve all got iPhones. Out here, the veneer of modernity gets real thin. This is a closed society. Inside their heads&#8212;and here he tapped against the side of his own head&#8212;it&#8217;s still 1156.</p><p>I met Orlando in a tiny bookshop-caf&#233; tangled up somewhere in Jaisalmer&#8217;s knot of alleys. This is a weird place. A lot of the streets here don&#8217;t have names: even on Google a bunch of addresses simply consist of &#8216;near the Lakshmi temple&#8217; or &#8216;near the eastern wall.&#8217; The postman knows where it is. But it meant I only got one conversation with Orlando, because when I tried to find that bookshop-caf&#233; again, it was unreachable. I just kept turning one corner after another onto a succession of charming alleyways lined with ornate overhanging balconies, all baking and silent in the forty-degree afternoon, none of which contained my destination. I was circling the little red pin on my maps app, sometimes coming extremely close, sometimes landing on top of it, but somehow the actual place was nowhere to be seen. It had absconded from Euclidean space. It was accessible only via some special alley, running at an angle slightly against the grain of the rest of the physical universe. But I remember the place. The bookshop sold what every bookshop in every tourist destination in India sells: the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, <em>Shantaram</em>, and <em>Atomic Habits</em>. They also did a decent stuffed paratha, and a little notice explained that if you dobbed him a few hundred rupees the owner would drive you out to his village in the desert and introduce you to his mum. There was also a Polaroid of the owner and Orlando posted up near the entrance, although I didn&#8217;t really notice it until after I&#8217;d met the man himself. Maybe <em>met</em> is the wrong word. What happened is that while I was midway through my paratha, Orlando entered and started talking to me. He continued for maybe two hours, at which point I said that I probably ought to get going. About half an hour later, I actually left. Maybe that was rude of me, leaving. Maybe that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t been allowed to return. </p><p>There are two types of people who will just <em>talk at you</em> like this, going through their entire life story without ever stopping to ask you a perfunctory question about yourself. Old people do it, and Americans do it too. Orlando was both. Fortunately, his life story was interesting. He came into the caf&#233; plump, pale, and sweating; smartly dressed, with his linen shirt neatly tucked into his cargo pants, but a big crunchy bucket hat on his head. He never told me exactly where he was from, just that he had quit the United States and had no intention of ever, ever going back. He lived in H&#7897;i An now, in a medium-sized apartment that he showed me through the many, many pictures on his phone. Here&#8217;s the bedroom. Here&#8217;s the bathroom. They both had the exact same white marble tiles on the floor. Isn&#8217;t it beautiful? he kept saying. He said that the American Dream was no longer possible in America; you had to go to Vietnam. He showed me a picture of his fridge-freezer. That&#8217;s it, he said, wide freezer, there&#8217;s a grocery store on the ground floor of my building, I don&#8217;t even have to go outside: that&#8217;s the American Dream. But he&#8217;d only recently discovered that the spirit of liberty is still alive on the Thu B&#7891;n Delta: before that, he&#8217;d spent five years living in Jaisalmer. It hadn&#8217;t worked out. There had been some catastrophe, some nameless bad thing had happened, and the people of this tiny hairball of a city had forced him to leave. But even if he couldn&#8217;t live here, he still kept coming back, for a month at a time, to check in on his old friends. Or to let his enemies know that they still hadn&#8217;t won.</p><p>I had to piece together Orlando&#8217;s story from the various little crumbs he dropped here and there in his long ramble, but I&#8217;ll give it to you in chronological order. Orlando had only recently retired from his job somewhere in the blandness of America when he got some very bad medical news. He responded by buying a plane ticket. Over the months that followed the medical news got worse and worse and his tickets got more and more expensive, until eventually it got so bad that he bought a one way flight. His wife didn&#8217;t approve. She still had a life. Whatever it was Orlando was doing, she&#8217;d had enough; she wanted him to come home. So that was it: after forty-eight years together, after everything they&#8217;d been through in that time, he divorced her. </p><p>Orlando drifted weightless around the world until he finally came to rest in Jaisalmer. He loved it here, this squiggle of old, old streets almost chiselled out of the rock. And he was welcomed, at first. Jaisalmer runs on the tourist industry, now there are no more camel caravans crossing the Thar Desert. According to Booking.com, this is one of the ten most welcoming cities on the planet. But the people of Jaisalmer expect their visitors to come, have various wonderful experiences, buy lots of tat, and then, crucially, leave. Orlando wouldn&#8217;t leave. He rented a room from an ancient, impoverished Brahmin woman inside the fort and started trying to worm his way into the actual life of the city. Accompanying his landlady to funerals. Eating meals with her. This made people antsy. Jaisalmer, Orlando kept telling me, is a closed society. Anyone with money can stay in its hotels, but only Brahmins and Rajputs are allowed to actually live inside the fort. Orlando was crossing a line. Eventually people started asking him what it was he did for a living. They weren&#8217;t making small talk: they were trying to place him in the caste system. They were trying to work out what sort of creature he was. But Orlando is an American: he comes from the shapeless world. I don&#8217;t do anything for a living, he told them, I just exist. Only one of his new neighbours was smart enough to ask: so, what did you do <em>before</em> you did nothing? Orlando fobbed him off too. Eventually, the head of the local Brahmin clan took him in for an interrogation. When you die, the Brahmin asked him, do you want to die in America or in India? Orlando told him that he was never going back to America. He lived in India now, and he wanted to die here too. The Brahmin wasn&#8217;t finished. When you die, he said, do you want to be buried or burned? Orlando pretended to think about it. I reckon burned, he decided. And when you&#8217;re burned, the Brahmin said, do you want the ashes to go in the ground or in the water? Orlando mulled this one over for a while. You know, he said, I&#8217;d never really thought about it, but my gut is telling me the ashes should go in the water. And that was it. The clan accepted him. He could stay.</p><p>But it&#8217;s dangerous, telling an American that the clan accepts him. Every single American goes through life nurturing the secret hope that some clan of brightly-dressed indigenes will some day realise that he has the spirit of the coyote, just like them, and adopt him into the tribe. It&#8217;s part of that colonial complex they have. Sooner or later, your American will get weird and start pushing boundaries. Orlando started pushing boundaries in very short order. All of this had happened in late 2019; a few months later, suddenly everyone in the world was confined to their homes and Jaisalmer&#8217;s tourist trade dried up overnight. For a town that produces nothing except beauty, this was very bad news. Orlando holed up in his landlady&#8217;s empty apartment, just the two of them in the dark, in a city gone silent. Everyone was suffering, pawning their gold jewellery to make it through the year, but unlike all his fellow clan members Orlando had a big fat American 401(k), and far away in New York the stock market was booming. A good chunk of it ended up in his landlady&#8217;s pockets. She was very grateful. She thanked him the only way she could: by performing puja to him, tying a rakhi around his wrist, and declaring him to be her brother. This, Orlando told me, was a big deal. Brother-sister relationships are not taken lightly in Hinduism. It might have been less serious if he and the landlady had just had sex. </p><p>Orlando&#8217;s version of events is that her clan were upset at being upstaged: that he&#8217;d stepped in to help this old woman when none of her actual family would. Shame becomes anger. And that might well have been part of it. But try to see things from their perspective. You make your accommodations with the tourist trade, but if you&#8217;re a very traditional Hindu&#8212;and a lot of people in Jaisalmer are&#8212;then all foreigners are technically outcastes, mleccha, impure, untouchable. Technically, Orlando and I and all the other rich Westerners who descend on this town to take photos and spend money occupy the same caste position as the shit-haulers and carrion-eaters, the people too impure to live in the village, who have to bed down with pigs in the filth-heaps outside. No one&#8217;s so strict now, obviously. You make your accommodations. Break bread with the rich outcastes, dress them up in colourful turbans, and always, always smile. You&#8217;ll even accept this one funny mleccha as an honorary member of the clan, a kind of animal mascot, like the goat that&#8217;s a sergeant in the Indian Army. But if he&#8217;s a <em>brother</em>, that means you have actual kinship relations with this creature. Suddenly it&#8217;s not a game any more. Word got to Orlando that he was no longer safe in Jaisalmer, and if he knew what was good for him he&#8217;d get out. So he did, in a hurry. He wiped his hard drive, carried his clothes and gadgets out of the fort, and gave them to a Muslim family with instructions to donate it all to the poor. Straight to the airport from there. Off to Vietnam, where the Communist Party is in power and the American Dream is alive: a normal, modern society where the world is nice and shapeless and anyone can rent an apartment from anyone else.</p><p>When I left, there were sonic booms overhead. Jaisalmer might be a medieval town with a medieval mindset, but it&#8217;s also a frontier town now: its isolated spot in the middle of the desert puts it right near the border with Pakistan. On the streets below, Brahmin clans protect the old ways in their half-rotten homes.

Back in <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-2-the-city-beautiful\">part two</a> I talked about learning the terrible secret of the Sun in Sawai Jai Singh&#8217;s city of Jaipur, but I didn&#8217;t mention that while I was there, entirely by chance, I ran into my friend Meagan Day, who you might know from her <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/author/meagan-day\">excellent labour reportage</a> for <em>Jacobin</em>. Meagan was in India for the annual conference of the Global Labour University, which was held this year at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. At JNU the walls were painted with the words <em>Workers of the world, unite!</em> in English, Hindi, and Malayalam, and there were talks from union organisers who&#8217;d been through truly terrible things in countries where they break strikes with clubs and guns. After the conference was over, she had a couple of days free, so she went to Jaipur to see some forts and palaces and gold and jewels. A few days for the proletariat, a few days for the aristocracy. </p><p>It was fun: we were ushered through various gaudily decorated rooms of state by a mandatory tour guide who kept pointing out the best spots for selfies; later we were menaced by the monkeys at the monkey temple. But during her time in Delhi, Meagan had managed to pick up on some of what&#8217;s happening on the Indian student left. What&#8217;s happening is this: a lot of people involved happen to be Brahmins, and every six months someone notices this fact, at which point everyone starts violently melting down over casteism and caste politics, and then as soon as the situation stabilises it happens again. Most recently, some academics released a statement supporting hunger-striking students, in which they repeated a few of the students&#8217; demands: a caste census, new student faculty elections, more sensitivity trainings, etc. The hunger strikers fid not take kindly to that &#8216;etc.&#8217; Posters on the &#8216;etc-ification&#8217; of oppressed-caste issues started appearing all over campus. &#8216;It&#8217;s not just about the grammar of the English language; it&#8217;s actually about the grammar of <em>Brahminical politics</em>.&#8217;</p><p>According to Raja, our guide in Jaipur, caste no longer matters in India. He came from the Verma caste, traditionally goldsmiths. And he had been an artist; his works had been exhibited in Germany and the Czech Republic. As it happened, his daughter had just started art school herself, studying textiles. But Raja insisted that this had nothing to do with being Verma. The Verma honour a particular deity called Bhairava, or The Fearsome One, a black, gnashing, sword-wielding, dog-riding emanation of Shiva who once cut off one of the heads of Brahma during an argument. As a Verma, Raja would occasionally sacrifice goats to Bhairava, but his profile picture on WhatsApp showed his actual favourite god: sweet, horny, flute-playing Krishna, all big eyes and pink pouty lips. Raja said he had friends from every caste: he ate with them, he drank with them, and if his daughter wanted to marry a non-Verma of course he wouldn&#8217;t care one bit. All of that is gone now, he said. Maybe in the countryside it still matters, but not here. But it clearly matters in Jaisalmer, and it also seemed to matter quite a lot to the Bahujan student activists at JNU. Their convolutions seemed familiar. Meagan and I are both fairly old-fashioned, class-oriented leftists, and for a while in the long 2010s that meant you were drafted into a very silly ideological struggle between class and some nebulous thing called <em>identity</em>. As far as we could tell, something similar is happening in India: caste joins race and gender and sexuality in the big bundle of axes of oppression. But caste is also <em>material</em>: it all has to do with the work you do. It looks like class; it <em>feels</em> like something else. Everyone knows that there&#8217;s a caste system in India, but the more you learn about it the murkier things get. What exactly is this thing? Where does it come from? What does it do?</p><p>I think I&#8217;ve found an answer. But it&#8217;s not what you think. In fact, almost everything you think you know about the caste system is probably wrong. Most Westerners are aware that there are four castes, which are the Brahmins, the priests and scholars, at the top, followed by Kshatriyas, kings and warriors, then Vaishyas, traders and artisans, and finally Shudras, peasants and servants, with the Dalits or untouchables in a kind of conceptual refuse ground beneath the entire system. This fourfold system is called varna, and simple and easy to remember, but it barely exists and hasn&#8217;t really functioned for a very long time. The actual Kshatriya lineages are all long extinct, and there are hardly any Vaishyas either; even most relatively high-caste people are from Shudra stock. Varna is also hardly unique to India; essentially the same system organised the estates of the anciens r&#233;gimes in Europe. The actual castes aren&#8217;t the varnas, but the jatis. </p><p>What is a jati? Mervyn Peake&#8217;s Gormenghast included a hereditary clan of &#8216;Grey Scrubbers&#8217; whose entire lives are spent cleaning the castle kitchens. &#8216;It had been their privilege on reaching adolescence to discover that, being the sons of their fathers, their careers had been arranged for them. Through daily proximity to the great slabs of stone, the faces of the Grey Scrubbers had become like slabs themselves. The eyes were there, small and flat as coins, and the colour of the walls themselves, as though during the long hours of professional staring the grey stone had at last reflected itself indelibly once and for all.&#8217; That&#8217;s a jati. Imagine if every air-traffic controller had to come from one of the secretive families of air-traffic controllers implanted in every city, and instead of passing an exam they simply perform their mysterious rites before a tiny black idol of God in his form as a cosmic air-traffic controller, directing the movements of stars and galaxies from his terminal in the great control tower beyond the physical universe, and then the airports have to hire them. Now imagine the air-traffic controllers all refuse to eat in the presence of pilots, who are their social inferiors, and if the daughter of an air-traffic controller tries to marry a pilot, her parents might try to kill her. Also, one person can &#8216;be&#8217; a pilot and another an air traffic controller, even though neither of them have been anywhere near an airport and they&#8217;re actually both just millet farmers. That&#8217;s a jati. There&#8217;s no single list of every jati in India, and according to a lot of experts such a list would be impossible, but depending on how you draw your definitions there are anywhere from 3,000 to 25,000 distinct endogamous castes. Water-carriers, barbers, spinners, dung-collectors, cannibals. And every few miles, the entire system shifts, and there&#8217;s a new and intricate balance of different castes, each with its own job to perform, its own internal laws, its own customs, and its own gods.</p><p>For slightly more clued-in Western observers, there have been two main approaches to the caste system. The first has been to see it as an expression of political and economic power relations. This approach is not always Marxist. Early European missionaries in India soon found that if they preached to the lower castes, the Brahmins would refuse to have anything to do with them, so the Jesuits started dividing themselves into castes and maintaining strict separation. Afterwards, they were accused of adopting heathen superstitions. (This happened to the Jesuits a lot, possibly because they kept adopting heathen superstitions. At the same time, over in China, they were happily taking part in Confucian sacrifices.) The missionaries replied that caste was a purely social distinction, not a religious one. For a long time, it was assumed by British administrators that the entire caste system had been invented by the Brahmins to entrench their social power. By Marx&#8217;s day, a few observers were starting to question this idea, but he was, unsurprisingly, on the side of caste as an expression of social divisions. In <em>The German Ideology</em>, he scoffs: &#8216;When the crude form of the division of labour which is to be found among the Indians calls forth the caste-system in their state and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form.&#8217; </p><p>I am still some kind of Marxist, so I am eventually going to conclude that caste is an expression of the division of labour. But I&#8217;m a bad Marxist, so we&#8217;re going to get there the long way, through the other approach, the one that involves ideas and ideologies and the thunder of animal-headed gods, rather than simple political and economic facts. And the division of labour we end up with might not be the one you&#8217;re used to.</p><p>Probably the best representative of the other side is Louis Dumont&#8217;s 1966 opus <em>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</em>. It&#8217;s an exhaustive study of caste as an ideology, and I&#8217;ve been lugging all five hundred and fifty pages around this vast country. In a moment we can consider whether Homo Hierarchicus is a good or useful book; the most important thing to know about it, though, is that it contains some really beautiful and incomprehensible French-structuralist diagrams, like this:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg\" width=\"652\" height=\"936\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:652,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:530156,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Dumont&#8217;s aim is to examine the caste system from the inside: instead of starting with big historical theories, he wants to reconstruct what it&#8217;s like to see the world through the eyes of someone deeply embedded in the world of caste. This is a difficult job. Europeans instinctively see society as a collection of basically autonomous individuals who have decided to come together for mutual gain. Indians are simply not the same. For Indians, any individual human being is just a piece of a rigid, all-encompassing hierarchy. And <em>hierarchy</em> is what Dumont identifies as the main principle of the caste system. Hierarchy looks a lot like ordinary power, but Dumont insists it&#8217;s something entirely different. There&#8217;s a division of labour, but &#8216;it eludes what we call economics because it is founded on an implicit reference to the whole, which, in its nature, is religious or, if one prefers, a matter of ultimate values.&#8217; Instead, the basis of the hierarchy is <em>purity</em>. Dumont contrasts India with Polynesia, where commoners can&#8217;t approach the king because his mana is so powerful it might kill them. In India, meanwhile, the Brahmin is the fragile one. These people really can&#8217;t do anything; they&#8217;re so pure that even the shadow of a low-caste person can pollute them, at which point they need to take a ritual bath or rub themselves with one of the five products of the cow. But <em>everyone</em> is polluted by the castes beneath them, which is why people refuse to take water or cooked food or to share a pipe with anyone too far below them in the order of purity. (Obviously you can take raw food, otherwise only the farmers would be able to eat.) This is what keeps the whole thing functioning. So in the chart above, the potter caste will accept boiled rice from the carpenter caste, but not the gardener caste. This is how you can tell that carpenters are higher-caste than gardeners. But absolutely nobody will take food from the tanner caste, who work with dead cows and are therefore inherently impure and untouchable. This holds even though most untouchables didn&#8217;t actually do the impure work associated with their castes; they were usually just agricultural serfs. The stink of leather still clings to their skin.</p><p>Sometimes ordinary power does break through into the system. Rajputs are a powerful warrior caste, so they get sorted right below the Brahmins, even though they eat meat, which is polluting. Nobody wants to argue with a warlord. (Still, if you look at the chart, you&#8217;ll see that a lot of the vegetarian &#8216;C&#8217; castes won&#8217;t take food from a Rajput, despite being notionally beneath them.) But that&#8217;s just power. Every village in India has its local landowning caste, and &#8216;almost any group whatsoever has, in favourable circumstances, been able to become the dominant caste in a given locality.&#8217; The dominant caste can be gardeners or tobacco-curers or shoemakers, as long as there are enough of them, with enough weapons to keep everyone else down. VS Naipaul describes what a dominant caste looks like in an ordinary Bihari village. &#8216;Above the huts rose the rambling two storey brick mansion of the family who had once owned it all, the land and the people: grandeur that wasn&#8217;t grandeur, but was like part of the squalor and defeat out of which it had risen.&#8217; Status in the caste hierarchy is something completely different, and sometimes it&#8217;s actively disempowering. The Brahmins might be at the top of the pole, but because of their impeccable purity they're often the ones who have to cook for other castes at weddings and funerals. Dumont notes that even in the bigger towns, a lot of restaurants and caf&#233;s advertise that they employ a Brahmin cook.</p><p>I feel bad for Louis Dumont. His model was based on a lot of intensive research, and it made a lot of sense, but it was doomed. Here he was, a French anthropologist, positing a coherent and self-contained structure that could be fully understood by the human sciences. The year was 1966. You might have worked out what&#8217;s coming next. Dumont couldn&#8217;t know it, but the entire time he was writing the book an enormous dark thundercloud was building up behind him. Its name was Jacques Derrida, and when it burst it would wash away Dumont&#8217;s entire thesis in a single terrible flood.</p><p>Today, basically every anthropological account of the caste system still finds time to mention Dumont, but only to totally disavow him. Everyone agrees that what he did was <em>bad anthropology</em>, barely any better than the dark old days of the discipline, when it was all about measuring various savages&#8217; skulls to determine their exact IQ, or Indolence Quotient. So in my Blackwell <em>Companion to the Anthropology of India</em>, another big heavy book that&#8217;s been weighing me down in the desert, there&#8217;s a survey of the caste system by Robert Deli&#232;ge, who begins by theatrically accusing Dumont of being &#8216;typical of the Orientalist tradition,&#8217; &#8216;perpetuating the implicit assumption that social order is imposed upon individuals who are passive and static agents,&#8217; and contributing to a racist vision in which India is &#8216;a world devoid of social change, economic development, equality, compassion, and communal solidarity.&#8217; Others have gone further. There&#8217;s a strong current within Hindu nationalism that claims the caste system doesn&#8217;t even exist, because the entire concept of a caste system is intrinsically incoherent. After all, no possible theoretical construct could actually correspond to the free play that escapes the rigours of any particular sign. Pay no attention to the people living in filth and misery on the edge of the city. Don&#8217;t you know that the structure is always simultaneously destructuring itself?</p><p>But despite feeling bad for him, in the end I&#8217;m not sure Dumont&#8217;s project really works. He set out to explain the caste system in its own terms. This is a big job, but it&#8217;s possible. Read Inga Clendinnen&#8217;s <em>Aztecs: an Interpretation</em>, and you won&#8217;t just understand why the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, you&#8217;ll start to wonder how our society manages to function <em>without</em> tearing out hearts for Tezcatlipoca. Dumont does not manage the same feat, because he almost entirely ignores the actual conceptual basis of the entire system. </p><p>Caste, he says, is a hierarchy based on ritual purity. And the concept of ritual purity does actually explain some of the more inexplicable things I&#8217;ve seen in this country. Like the filth. I might not be the first person to have noticed that public space in India is not hygienic. People keep their homes spotless, even if they&#8217;re living in a shack in the slums, and all the shops and restaurants and temples are impeccable too. But as soon as you step outside, it&#8217;s s game of dodge-the-turd, and not all the turds belong to animals. There are signs and murals everywhere begging people to care about their environment, but most people simply refuse. On the train here I was given a plastic tray with little compartments for the chana, dal, rice, chapati, and pickle, a kind of Indian bento box, and afterwards I was wandering around trying to find a bin that would take my dirty tray. Eventually the attendant snatched it from me, looked at me like I was an idiot, and chucked it out the open door of the moving train. It&#8217;s not like India couldn&#8217;t keep itself clean if it wanted to. This country has put a probe on the Moon. But it doesn&#8217;t want to. This is not a cultural value. And when you start thinking from the standpoint of ritual purity, this is actually completely reasonable. The world outside your home is <em>inherently</em> filthy and polluting, because this is where people of different castes mix. A Brahmin has to take a ritual bath whenever they go out. You could pick up all the litter and hose all the shit off the pavement, but it wouldn&#8217;t do anything at all to make those streets clean. So why bother?</p><p>But once Dumont&#8217;s introduced the idea of a purity hierarchy, he then spends the rest of the book thinking exclusively about <em>hierarchy</em>, and never really touches the notion of purity again. But what even <em>is</em> ritual purity? Where&#8217;s it come from? What&#8217;s it for? Dumont briefly plonks down the idea that &#8216;impurity marks the irruption of the biological into social life,&#8217; and suggests that the ritual impurity attached to processes like birth, death, and menstruation ended up attaching itself to lower castes as a permanent condition. But he doesn&#8217;t seem interested in pursuing it. Still, there&#8217;s a weird undercurrent running through his book. Squint at it just right, and it starts to look like the caste system isn&#8217;t really about people at all. It&#8217;s about cattle.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3133058,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There are a lot of cattle in Jaisalmer. Every city in India has its feral cows, but here the streets are <em>full</em> of them. They bellow in the mornings, they leave huge piles of wet shit in the streets, and they make it utterly impossible to get around. Every third alley is blocked off by a huge dumb animal, chewing slowly and displaying absolutely no interest in the world around it. You try to edge around the cow and it just stands there, indifferently occupying the entire width of the street. You try to move it along and it just whips its tail at you like you&#8217;re just another buzzing fly. The cows here are wonderfully gentle creatures: it&#8217;s hard for me to watch them tenderly, lovingly nibble at each other&#8217;s faces without feeling an immense stab of guilt for all those steaks and burgers and rendangs and b&#250;n b&#242; x&#224;os. But they are as thick as bricks, and there are more than five million feral cattle roaming the streets in this country, and this feels like a problem.</p><p>Everyone knows that cows are sacred in Hinduism. But being sacred does not always seem like it&#8217;s <em>good</em> for them. In fact, the way cows are treated here makes me almost want to abandon my Kantianism and become a utilitarian. The governing principle is ahimsa, non-violence, non-interference, which is not the same as ensuring the best possible outcome. So when a cow stops giving milk, instead of slaughtering it the farmer simply lets it wander free. A lot of these cows wander into cities, where people practice ahimsa by letting the sacred cattle eat from piles of stinking garbage on the ground. Cattle with their nuzzles in dumpsters, sweet tottering calves browsing through the filth. Instead of grass, these cows seem to subsist on paper. I&#8217;ve seen them munch down on coffee cups and newspapers and fliers. One cow that had found a trove of discarded books and was systematically eating its way through them all. Eating <em>Shantaram</em>. Eating <em>Atomic Habits</em>. The ribs show through the skin, but the bellies are tight and swollen. Their entire back quarters are splattered with their own liquid, diseased splatterings. It&#8217;s genuinely horrible to see. I try to remember that my own society does terrible things to these animals too, much worse than anything in India, but back home the torture and death takes place behind closed doors where nobody can see. But this is not exactly a comforting thought.</p><p>Here, though, it doesn&#8217;t matter where a cow lives or what it&#8217;s been eating: cows are pure, and cows are purifying. As I&#8217;ve mentioned, after contact with a lower-caste person, Brahmins can cleanse themselves with the five products of the cow. Those five products are milk, ghee, yoghurt, piss, and shit. Cow urine is used in soap and shampoo; it&#8217;s also sold as a medical cure-all. The BJP government has funded research into the cancer-curing properties of cow urine and dung. Floor cleaners made with cow urine have been used in public hospitals. Pathogens in cow piss include leptospira, which can cause jaundice, kidney and liver failure, and bleeding in the lungs, and brucella, which will give you endocarditis, pus-filled testicles, a swollen spleen, and abscesses in your brain. Swabbing down a hospital floor with the stuff is not a very good idea. So why are so many people convinced that it might be? Ask a Hindu, and they&#8217;ll tell you the cow is revered for its generous, motherly gifts of milk. That&#8217;s a very modern answer. It wasn&#8217;t always that way. A few thousand years ago, the people of India&#8212;like a lot of other people around the world&#8212;revered the cow as a <em>sacrificial animal</em>. The best gift for the gods. But it can&#8217;t just be any cow. &#8216;Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke&#8230;&#8217; There are many similar requirements in the Vedas and the Shrauta Sutras. The animal must be clean, washed, perfumed, unblemished, uninjured, undefiled. Whatever goes to the gods must be pure. Or, in other words: purity is whatever gets devoured by the gods.</p><p>Ritual sacrifice isn&#8217;t such a big deal in contemporary Hinduism. But Dumont keeps finding inconvenient traces of it scattered about the caste system. Cows keep wandering into his alleyways. In that chart above, he has to distinguish between &#8216;kacca&#8217; and &#8216;pakka&#8217; foods. Pakka is safer than kacca; you can take it from lower castes. The difference is that kacca is food boiled in water, and pakka is fried in ghee. It&#8217;s shielded from contamination thanks to &#8216;the protective role of butter, a product of the cow.&#8217; The system of mutual independence between castes in a single village&#8212;the barbers cut the tailors&#8217; hair, the tailors cut the barbers&#8217; suits, the blacksmiths make their scissors&#8212;is called the jajmani system. But the word <em>jajman</em> doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with bucolic village communities. It comes from the Sanskrit <em>yajam&#257;na</em>, which refers to the person who commissions an animal sacrifice. In fact, the entire hierarchy of varnas originally centred around animal sacrifice. Vaishyas raise the cattle, Kshatriyas sponsor the festival, but only a Brahmin can actually plunge the knife into the animal&#8217;s neck. Today, of course, killing a cow is unthinkable. But Dumont does stumble on another weird parallel. The two worst crimes imaginable are the murder of a cow and the murder of a Brahmin. Their lives are, in some way, equivalent. </p><p>Just like Marx said, the caste system was called forth by a crude form of the division of labour. But that labour didn&#8217;t produce ordinary use-values: it produced <em>sacrifices</em>, flesh for the gods. It also no longer exists, not in any large-scale way, even if people like Raja still send the odd goat to Bhairava. Animal sacrifice declined, and the caste system emerged to replace it&#8212;with the position of the sacrificed animal, the pure and unpolluted meal for the gods, taken over <em>by the Brahmin himself</em>. Meanwhile, the Brahmin&#8217;s original functions&#8212;slaughtering cattle, butchering cattle, cutting the skin of cattle&#8212;were displaced onto the absolute lowest and most despised members of society. And around the same time, Hindu texts&#8212;which had, in the Vedic period, had very little to say about the subject&#8212;suddenly start talking almost incessantly about reincarnation and the transmigration of souls.</p><p>Whatever you&#8217;ve been told, India is not a fixed, hierarchical society. In fact, it has an extraordinary rate of social mobility. It&#8217;s just that instead of escaping poverty within your lifetime, you move up in the world through the mechanism of death and reincarnation. The caste system is a ladder. You don&#8217;t advance by being <em>good</em>, exactly: every social stratum has its dharma, the role it has to play within the social whole. The dharma of the king is to rule; the dharma of the barber-caste is to cut hair; the dharma of an airport security officer is to steal your shampoo; the dharma of a prostitute is to corrupt the souls of men; the dharma of an untouchable is to live in miserable squalor in the wastelands out of sight. Conform to your role, and in your next life you&#8217;ll be born a little purer, a little more refined, a little higher up the chain. It might take ten billion lifetimes, but once you reach the very top your purity is impeccable. You are clean. You are unblemished. There is nowhere else to go. You have made yourself a meal fit for the gods. </p><p>The whole of society is one huge sacrifice ritual. Maybe it&#8217;s the same for all systems of purity and stratification. Virtue politics, being a decent person, class society and its inequalities: a cleansing before the slaughter. </p><p>About an hour&#8217;s drive into the desert from Jaisalmer are the ruins of Kuldhara. One well-preserved temple and a few half-crumbled mansions in a landscape of broken walls. In the thirteenth century, this village was settled by the Paliwals, a Brahmin clan from the east. They lived there for hundreds of years, until, one night in 1823, the entire population vanished. They left their gold and their jewels and their lentils cooking over the fire. No bodies were ever found. At the very top of the class system there stands Kali, her fangs dripping with blood, the consumer of souls.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">This edition of <em>Numb in India</em> is free, but the others aren&#8217;t.

Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. Last year, in China, free subscribers got to peek behind the curtain in a free post on the insanity of the Chinese language. This post on the caste system is also free, but all the best parts of all the others are behind the paywall. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from Jaisalmer, a fortified knuckle of sandstone in the middle of the Thar Desert. This city was founded in 1156 by the Bhati, a Rajput clan pushed into the desert from their Afghan heartland by waves of invaders from the steppe. According to Orlando, for the people of Jaisalmer not much has changed since. Don’t be fooled by their clothes, he told me. Don’t be fooled by the fact that they’ve all got iPhones. Out here, the veneer of modernity gets real thin. This is a closed society. Inside their heads—and here he tapped against the side of his own head—it’s still 1156.\nI met Orlando in a tiny bookshop-café tangled up somewhere in Jaisalmer’s knot of alleys. This is a weird place. A lot of the streets here don’t have names: even on Google a bunch of addresses simply consist of ‘near the Lakshmi temple’ or ‘near the eastern wall.’ The postman knows where it is. But it meant I only got one conversation with Orlando, because when I tried to find that bookshop-café again, it was unreachable. I just kept turning one corner after another onto a succession of charming alleyways lined with ornate overhanging balconies, all baking and silent in the forty-degree afternoon, none of which contained my destination. I was circling the little red pin on my maps app, sometimes coming extremely close, sometimes landing on top of it, but somehow the actual place was nowhere to be seen. It had absconded from Euclidean space. It was accessible only via some special alley, running at an angle slightly against the grain of the rest of the physical universe. But I remember the place. The bookshop sold what every bookshop in every tourist destination in India sells: the Bhagavad Gita, Shantaram, and Atomic Habits. They also did a decent stuffed paratha, and a little notice explained that if you dobbed him a few hundred rupees the owner would drive you out to his village in the desert and introduce you to his mum. There was also a Polaroid of the owner and Orlando posted up near the entrance, although I didn’t really notice it until after I’d met the man himself. Maybe met is the wrong word. What happened is that while I was midway through my paratha, Orlando entered and started talking to me. He continued for maybe two hours, at which point I said that I probably ought to get going. About half an hour later, I actually left. Maybe that was rude of me, leaving. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been allowed to return.\nThere are two types of people who will just talk at you like this, going through their entire life story without ever stopping to ask you a perfunctory question about yourself. Old people do it, and Americans do it too. Orlando was both. Fortunately, his life story was interesting. He came into the café plump, pale, and sweating; smartly dressed, with his linen shirt neatly tucked into his cargo pants, but a big crunchy bucket hat on his head. He never told me exactly where he was from, just that he had quit the United States and had no intention of ever, ever going back. He lived in Hội An now, in a medium-sized apartment that he showed me through the many, many pictures on his phone. Here’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. They both had the exact same white marble tiles on the floor. Isn’t it beautiful? he kept saying. He said that the American Dream was no longer possible in America; you had to go to Vietnam. He showed me a picture of his fridge-freezer. That’s it, he said, wide freezer, there’s a grocery store on the ground floor of my building, I don’t even have to go outside: that’s the American Dream. But he’d only recently discovered that the spirit of liberty is still alive on the Thu Bồn Delta: before that, he’d spent five years living in Jaisalmer. It hadn’t worked out. There had been some catastrophe, some nameless bad thing had happened, and the people of this tiny hairball of a city had forced him to leave. But even if he couldn’t live here, he still kept coming back, for a month at a time, to check in on his old friends. Or to let his enemies know that they still hadn’t won.\nI had to piece together Orlando’s story from the various little crumbs he dropped here and there in his long ramble, but I’ll give it to you in chronological order. Orlando had only recently retired from his job somewhere in the blandness of America when he got some very bad medical news. He responded by buying a plane ticket. Over the months that followed the medical news got worse and worse and his tickets got more and more expensive, until eventually it got so bad that he bought a one way flight. His wife didn’t approve. She still had a life. Whatever it was Orlando was doing, she’d had enough; she wanted him to come home. So that was it: after forty-eight years together, after everything they’d been through in that time, he divorced her.\nOrlando drifted weightless around the world until he finally came to rest in Jaisalmer. He loved it here, this squiggle of old, old streets almost chiselled out of the rock. And he was welcomed, at first. Jaisalmer runs on the tourist industry, now there are no more camel caravans crossing the Thar Desert. According to Booking.com, this is one of the ten most welcoming cities on the planet. But the people of Jaisalmer expect their visitors to come, have various wonderful experiences, buy lots of tat, and then, crucially, leave. Orlando wouldn’t leave. He rented a room from an ancient, impoverished Brahmin woman inside the fort and started trying to worm his way into the actual life of the city. Accompanying his landlady to funerals. Eating meals with her. This made people antsy. Jaisalmer, Orlando kept telling me, is a closed society. Anyone with money can stay in its hotels, but only Brahmins and Rajputs are allowed to actually live inside the fort. Orlando was crossing a line. Eventually people started asking him what it was he did for a living. They weren’t making small talk: they were trying to place him in the caste system. They were trying to work out what sort of creature he was. But Orlando is an American: he comes from the shapeless world. I don’t do anything for a living, he told them, I just exist. Only one of his new neighbours was smart enough to ask: so, what did you do before you did nothing? Orlando fobbed him off too. Eventually, the head of the local Brahmin clan took him in for an interrogation. When you die, the Brahmin asked him, do you want to die in America or in India? Orlando told him that he was never going back to America. He lived in India now, and he wanted to die here too. The Brahmin wasn’t finished. When you die, he said, do you want to be buried or burned? Orlando pretended to think about it. I reckon burned, he decided. And when you’re burned, the Brahmin said, do you want the ashes to go in the ground or in the water? Orlando mulled this one over for a while. You know, he said, I’d never really thought about it, but my gut is telling me the ashes should go in the water. And that was it. The clan accepted him. He could stay.\nBut it’s dangerous, telling an American that the clan accepts him. Every single American goes through life nurturing the secret hope that some clan of brightly-dressed indigenes will some day realise that he has the spirit of the coyote, just like them, and adopt him into the tribe. It’s part of that colonial complex they have. Sooner or later, your American will get weird and start pushing boundaries. Orlando started pushing boundaries in very short order. All of this had happened in late 2019; a few months later, suddenly everyone in the world was confined to their homes and Jaisalmer’s tourist trade dried up overnight. For a town that produces nothing except beauty, this was very bad news. Orlando holed up in his landlady’s empty apartment, just the two of them in the dark, in a city gone silent. Everyone was suffering, pawning their gold jewellery to make it through the year, but unlike all his fellow clan members Orlando had a big fat American 401(k), and far away in New York the stock market was booming. A good chunk of it ended up in his landlady’s pockets. She was very grateful. She thanked him the only way she could: by performing puja to him, tying a rakhi around his wrist, and declaring him to be her brother. This, Orlando told me, was a big deal. Brother-sister relationships are not taken lightly in Hinduism. It might have been less serious if he and the landlady had just had sex.\nOrlando’s version of events is that her clan were upset at being upstaged: that he’d stepped in to help this old woman when none of her actual family would. Shame becomes anger. And that might well have been part of it. But try to see things from their perspective. You make your accommodations with the tourist trade, but if you’re a very traditional Hindu—and a lot of people in Jaisalmer are—then all foreigners are technically outcastes, mleccha, impure, untouchable. Technically, Orlando and I and all the other rich Westerners who descend on this town to take photos and spend money occupy the same caste position as the shit-haulers and carrion-eaters, the people too impure to live in the village, who have to bed down with pigs in the filth-heaps outside. No one’s so strict now, obviously. You make your accommodations. Break bread with the rich outcastes, dress them up in colourful turbans, and always, always smile. You’ll even accept this one funny mleccha as an honorary member of the clan, a kind of animal mascot, like the goat that’s a sergeant in the Indian Army. But if he’s a brother, that means you have actual kinship relations with this creature. Suddenly it’s not a game any more. Word got to Orlando that he was no longer safe in Jaisalmer, and if he knew what was good for him he’d get out. So he did, in a hurry. He wiped his hard drive, carried his clothes and gadgets out of the fort, and gave them to a Muslim family with instructions to donate it all to the poor. Straight to the airport from there. Off to Vietnam, where the Communist Party is in power and the American Dream is alive: a normal, modern society where the world is nice and shapeless and anyone can rent an apartment from anyone else.\nWhen I left, there were sonic booms overhead. Jaisalmer might be a medieval town with a medieval mindset, but it’s also a frontier town now: its isolated spot in the middle of the desert puts it right near the border with Pakistan. On the streets below, Brahmin clans protect the old ways in their half-rotten homes. Up above, the Indian Air Force flings billion-dollar fighter jets against the sky.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOrlando isn’t the only American I’ve encountered out here. Back in part two I talked about learning the terrible secret of the Sun in Sawai Jai Singh’s city of Jaipur, but I didn’t mention that while I was there, entirely by chance, I ran into my friend Meagan Day, who you might know from her excellent labour reportage for Jacobin. Meagan was in India for the annual conference of the Global Labour University, which was held this year at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. At JNU the walls were painted with the words Workers of the world, unite! in English, Hindi, and Malayalam, and there were talks from union organisers who’d been through truly terrible things in countries where they break strikes with clubs and guns. After the conference was over, she had a couple of days free, so she went to Jaipur to see some forts and palaces and gold and jewels. A few days for the proletariat, a few days for the aristocracy.\nIt was fun: we were ushered through various gaudily decorated rooms of state by a mandatory tour guide who kept pointing out the best spots for selfies; later we were menaced by the monkeys at the monkey temple. But during her time in Delhi, Meagan had managed to pick up on some of what’s happening on the Indian student left. What’s happening is this: a lot of people involved happen to be Brahmins, and every six months someone notices this fact, at which point everyone starts violently melting down over casteism and caste politics, and then as soon as the situation stabilises it happens again. Most recently, some academics released a statement supporting hunger-striking students, in which they repeated a few of the students’ demands: a caste census, new student faculty elections, more sensitivity trainings, etc. The hunger strikers fid not take kindly to that ‘etc.’ Posters on the ‘etc-ification’ of oppressed-caste issues started appearing all over campus. ‘It’s not just about the grammar of the English language; it’s actually about the grammar of Brahminical politics.’\nAccording to Raja, our guide in Jaipur, caste no longer matters in India. He came from the Verma caste, traditionally goldsmiths. And he had been an artist; his works had been exhibited in Germany and the Czech Republic. As it happened, his daughter had just started art school herself, studying textiles. But Raja insisted that this had nothing to do with being Verma. The Verma honour a particular deity called Bhairava, or The Fearsome One, a black, gnashing, sword-wielding, dog-riding emanation of Shiva who once cut off one of the heads of Brahma during an argument. As a Verma, Raja would occasionally sacrifice goats to Bhairava, but his profile picture on WhatsApp showed his actual favourite god: sweet, horny, flute-playing Krishna, all big eyes and pink pouty lips. Raja said he had friends from every caste: he ate with them, he drank with them, and if his daughter wanted to marry a non-Verma of course he wouldn’t care one bit. All of that is gone now, he said. Maybe in the countryside it still matters, but not here. But it clearly matters in Jaisalmer, and it also seemed to matter quite a lot to the Bahujan student activists at JNU. Their convolutions seemed familiar. Meagan and I are both fairly old-fashioned, class-oriented leftists, and for a while in the long 2010s that meant you were drafted into a very silly ideological struggle between class and some nebulous thing called identity. As far as we could tell, something similar is happening in India: caste joins race and gender and sexuality in the big bundle of axes of oppression. But caste is also material: it all has to do with the work you do. It looks like class; it feels like something else. Everyone knows that there’s a caste system in India, but the more you learn about it the murkier things get. What exactly is this thing? Where does it come from? What does it do?\nI think I’ve found an answer. But it’s not what you think. In fact, almost everything you think you know about the caste system is probably wrong. Most Westerners are aware that there are four castes, which are the Brahmins, the priests and scholars, at the top, followed by Kshatriyas, kings and warriors, then Vaishyas, traders and artisans, and finally Shudras, peasants and servants, with the Dalits or untouchables in a kind of conceptual refuse ground beneath the entire system. This fourfold system is called varna, and simple and easy to remember, but it barely exists and hasn’t really functioned for a very long time. The actual Kshatriya lineages are all long extinct, and there are hardly any Vaishyas either; even most relatively high-caste people are from Shudra stock. Varna is also hardly unique to India; essentially the same system organised the estates of the anciens régimes in Europe. The actual castes aren’t the varnas, but the jatis.\nWhat is a jati? Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast included a hereditary clan of ‘Grey Scrubbers’ whose entire lives are spent cleaning the castle kitchens. ‘It had been their privilege on reaching adolescence to discover that, being the sons of their fathers, their careers had been arranged for them. Through daily proximity to the great slabs of stone, the faces of the Grey Scrubbers had become like slabs themselves. The eyes were there, small and flat as coins, and the colour of the walls themselves, as though during the long hours of professional staring the grey stone had at last reflected itself indelibly once and for all.’ That’s a jati. Imagine if every air-traffic controller had to come from one of the secretive families of air-traffic controllers implanted in every city, and instead of passing an exam they simply perform their mysterious rites before a tiny black idol of God in his form as a cosmic air-traffic controller, directing the movements of stars and galaxies from his terminal in the great control tower beyond the physical universe, and then the airports have to hire them. Now imagine the air-traffic controllers all refuse to eat in the presence of pilots, who are their social inferiors, and if the daughter of an air-traffic controller tries to marry a pilot, her parents might try to kill her. Also, one person can ‘be’ a pilot and another an air traffic controller, even though neither of them have been anywhere near an airport and they’re actually both just millet farmers. That’s a jati. There’s no single list of every jati in India, and according to a lot of experts such a list would be impossible, but depending on how you draw your definitions there are anywhere from 3,000 to 25,000 distinct endogamous castes. Water-carriers, barbers, spinners, dung-collectors, cannibals. And every few miles, the entire system shifts, and there’s a new and intricate balance of different castes, each with its own job to perform, its own internal laws, its own customs, and its own gods.\nFor slightly more clued-in Western observers, there have been two main approaches to the caste system. The first has been to see it as an expression of political and economic power relations. This approach is not always Marxist. Early European missionaries in India soon found that if they preached to the lower castes, the Brahmins would refuse to have anything to do with them, so the Jesuits started dividing themselves into castes and maintaining strict separation. Afterwards, they were accused of adopting heathen superstitions. (This happened to the Jesuits a lot, possibly because they kept adopting heathen superstitions. At the same time, over in China, they were happily taking part in Confucian sacrifices.) The missionaries replied that caste was a purely social distinction, not a religious one. For a long time, it was assumed by British administrators that the entire caste system had been invented by the Brahmins to entrench their social power. By Marx’s day, a few observers were starting to question this idea, but he was, unsurprisingly, on the side of caste as an expression of social divisions. In The German Ideology, he scoffs: ‘When the crude form of the division of labour which is to be found among the Indians calls forth the caste-system in their state and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form.’\nI am still some kind of Marxist, so I am eventually going to conclude that caste is an expression of the division of labour. But I’m a bad Marxist, so we’re going to get there the long way, through the other approach, the one that involves ideas and ideologies and the thunder of animal-headed gods, rather than simple political and economic facts. And the division of labour we end up with might not be the one you’re used to.\nProbably the best representative of the other side is Louis Dumont’s 1966 opus Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications. It’s an exhaustive study of caste as an ideology, and I’ve been lugging all five hundred and fifty pages around this vast country. In a moment we can consider whether Homo Hierarchicus is a good or useful book; the most important thing to know about it, though, is that it contains some really beautiful and incomprehensible French-structuralist diagrams, like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nDumont’s aim is to examine the caste system from the inside: instead of starting with big historical theories, he wants to reconstruct what it’s like to see the world through the eyes of someone deeply embedded in the world of caste. This is a difficult job. Europeans instinctively see society as a collection of basically autonomous individuals who have decided to come together for mutual gain. Indians are simply not the same. For Indians, any individual human being is just a piece of a rigid, all-encompassing hierarchy. And hierarchy is what Dumont identifies as the main principle of the caste system. Hierarchy looks a lot like ordinary power, but Dumont insists it’s something entirely different. There’s a division of labour, but ‘it eludes what we call economics because it is founded on an implicit reference to the whole, which, in its nature, is religious or, if one prefers, a matter of ultimate values.’ Instead, the basis of the hierarchy is purity. Dumont contrasts India with Polynesia, where commoners can’t approach the king because his mana is so powerful it might kill them. In India, meanwhile, the Brahmin is the fragile one. These people really can’t do anything; they’re so pure that even the shadow of a low-caste person can pollute them, at which point they need to take a ritual bath or rub themselves with one of the five products of the cow. But everyone is polluted by the castes beneath them, which is why people refuse to take water or cooked food or to share a pipe with anyone too far below them in the order of purity. (Obviously you can take raw food, otherwise only the farmers would be able to eat.) This is what keeps the whole thing functioning. So in the chart above, the potter caste will accept boiled rice from the carpenter caste, but not the gardener caste. This is how you can tell that carpenters are higher-caste than gardeners. But absolutely nobody will take food from the tanner caste, who work with dead cows and are therefore inherently impure and untouchable. This holds even though most untouchables didn’t actually do the impure work associated with their castes; they were usually just agricultural serfs. The stink of leather still clings to their skin.\nSometimes ordinary power does break through into the system. Rajputs are a powerful warrior caste, so they get sorted right below the Brahmins, even though they eat meat, which is polluting. Nobody wants to argue with a warlord. (Still, if you look at the chart, you’ll see that a lot of the vegetarian ‘C’ castes won’t take food from a Rajput, despite being notionally beneath them.) But that’s just power. Every village in India has its local landowning caste, and ‘almost any group whatsoever has, in favourable circumstances, been able to become the dominant caste in a given locality.’ The dominant caste can be gardeners or tobacco-curers or shoemakers, as long as there are enough of them, with enough weapons to keep everyone else down. VS Naipaul describes what a dominant caste looks like in an ordinary Bihari village. ‘Above the huts rose the rambling two storey brick mansion of the family who had once owned it all, the land and the people: grandeur that wasn’t grandeur, but was like part of the squalor and defeat out of which it had risen.’ Status in the caste hierarchy is something completely different, and sometimes it’s actively disempowering. The Brahmins might be at the top of the pole, but because of their impeccable purity they're often the ones who have to cook for other castes at weddings and funerals. Dumont notes that even in the bigger towns, a lot of restaurants and cafés advertise that they employ a Brahmin cook.\nI feel bad for Louis Dumont. His model was based on a lot of intensive research, and it made a lot of sense, but it was doomed. Here he was, a French anthropologist, positing a coherent and self-contained structure that could be fully understood by the human sciences. The year was 1966. You might have worked out what’s coming next. Dumont couldn’t know it, but the entire time he was writing the book an enormous dark thundercloud was building up behind him. Its name was Jacques Derrida, and when it burst it would wash away Dumont’s entire thesis in a single terrible flood.\nToday, basically every anthropological account of the caste system still finds time to mention Dumont, but only to totally disavow him. Everyone agrees that what he did was bad anthropology, barely any better than the dark old days of the discipline, when it was all about measuring various savages’ skulls to determine their exact IQ, or Indolence Quotient. So in my Blackwell Companion to the Anthropology of India, another big heavy book that’s been weighing me down in the desert, there’s a survey of the caste system by Robert Deliège, who begins by theatrically accusing Dumont of being ‘typical of the Orientalist tradition,’ ‘perpetuating the implicit assumption that social order is imposed upon individuals who are passive and static agents,’ and contributing to a racist vision in which India is ‘a world devoid of social change, economic development, equality, compassion, and communal solidarity.’ Others have gone further. There’s a strong current within Hindu nationalism that claims the caste system doesn’t even exist, because the entire concept of a caste system is intrinsically incoherent. After all, no possible theoretical construct could actually correspond to the free play that escapes the rigours of any particular sign. Pay no attention to the people living in filth and misery on the edge of the city. Don’t you know that the structure is always simultaneously destructuring itself?\nBut despite feeling bad for him, in the end I’m not sure Dumont’s project really works. He set out to explain the caste system in its own terms. This is a big job, but it’s possible. Read Inga Clendinnen’s Aztecs: an Interpretation, and you won’t just understand why the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, you’ll start to wonder how our society manages to function without tearing out hearts for Tezcatlipoca. Dumont does not manage the same feat, because he almost entirely ignores the actual conceptual basis of the entire system.\nCaste, he says, is a hierarchy based on ritual purity. And the concept of ritual purity does actually explain some of the more inexplicable things I’ve seen in this country. Like the filth. I might not be the first person to have noticed that public space in India is not hygienic. People keep their homes spotless, even if they’re living in a shack in the slums, and all the shops and restaurants and temples are impeccable too. But as soon as you step outside, it’s s game of dodge-the-turd, and not all the turds belong to animals. There are signs and murals everywhere begging people to care about their environment, but most people simply refuse. On the train here I was given a plastic tray with little compartments for the chana, dal, rice, chapati, and pickle, a kind of Indian bento box, and afterwards I was wandering around trying to find a bin that would take my dirty tray. Eventually the attendant snatched it from me, looked at me like I was an idiot, and chucked it out the open door of the moving train. It’s not like India couldn’t keep itself clean if it wanted to. This country has put a probe on the Moon. But it doesn’t want to. This is not a cultural value. And when you start thinking from the standpoint of ritual purity, this is actually completely reasonable. The world outside your home is inherently filthy and polluting, because this is where people of different castes mix. A Brahmin has to take a ritual bath whenever they go out. You could pick up all the litter and hose all the shit off the pavement, but it wouldn’t do anything at all to make those streets clean. So why bother?\nBut once Dumont’s introduced the idea of a purity hierarchy, he then spends the rest of the book thinking exclusively about hierarchy, and never really touches the notion of purity again. But what even is ritual purity? Where’s it come from? What’s it for? Dumont briefly plonks down the idea that ‘impurity marks the irruption of the biological into social life,’ and suggests that the ritual impurity attached to processes like birth, death, and menstruation ended up attaching itself to lower castes as a permanent condition. But he doesn’t seem interested in pursuing it. Still, there’s a weird undercurrent running through his book. Squint at it just right, and it starts to look like the caste system isn’t really about people at all. It’s about cattle.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of cattle in Jaisalmer. Every city in India has its feral cows, but here the streets are full of them. They bellow in the mornings, they leave huge piles of wet shit in the streets, and they make it utterly impossible to get around. Every third alley is blocked off by a huge dumb animal, chewing slowly and displaying absolutely no interest in the world around it. You try to edge around the cow and it just stands there, indifferently occupying the entire width of the street. You try to move it along and it just whips its tail at you like you’re just another buzzing fly. The cows here are wonderfully gentle creatures: it’s hard for me to watch them tenderly, lovingly nibble at each other’s faces without feeling an immense stab of guilt for all those steaks and burgers and rendangs and bún bò xàos. But they are as thick as bricks, and there are more than five million feral cattle roaming the streets in this country, and this feels like a problem.\nEveryone knows that cows are sacred in Hinduism. But being sacred does not always seem like it’s good for them. In fact, the way cows are treated here makes me almost want to abandon my Kantianism and become a utilitarian. The governing principle is ahimsa, non-violence, non-interference, which is not the same as ensuring the best possible outcome. So when a cow stops giving milk, instead of slaughtering it the farmer simply lets it wander free. A lot of these cows wander into cities, where people practice ahimsa by letting the sacred cattle eat from piles of stinking garbage on the ground. Cattle with their nuzzles in dumpsters, sweet tottering calves browsing through the filth. Instead of grass, these cows seem to subsist on paper. I’ve seen them munch down on coffee cups and newspapers and fliers. One cow that had found a trove of discarded books and was systematically eating its way through them all. Eating Shantaram. Eating Atomic Habits. The ribs show through the skin, but the bellies are tight and swollen. Their entire back quarters are splattered with their own liquid, diseased splatterings. It’s genuinely horrible to see. I try to remember that my own society does terrible things to these animals too, much worse than anything in India, but back home the torture and death takes place behind closed doors where nobody can see. But this is not exactly a comforting thought.\nHere, though, it doesn’t matter where a cow lives or what it’s been eating: cows are pure, and cows are purifying. As I’ve mentioned, after contact with a lower-caste person, Brahmins can cleanse themselves with the five products of the cow. Those five products are milk, ghee, yoghurt, piss, and shit. Cow urine is used in soap and shampoo; it’s also sold as a medical cure-all. The BJP government has funded research into the cancer-curing properties of cow urine and dung. Floor cleaners made with cow urine have been used in public hospitals. Pathogens in cow piss include leptospira, which can cause jaundice, kidney and liver failure, and bleeding in the lungs, and brucella, which will give you endocarditis, pus-filled testicles, a swollen spleen, and abscesses in your brain. Swabbing down a hospital floor with the stuff is not a very good idea. So why are so many people convinced that it might be? Ask a Hindu, and they’ll tell you the cow is revered for its generous, motherly gifts of milk. That’s a very modern answer. It wasn’t always that way. A few thousand years ago, the people of India—like a lot of other people around the world—revered the cow as a sacrificial animal. The best gift for the gods. But it can’t just be any cow. ‘Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke…’ There are many similar requirements in the Vedas and the Shrauta Sutras. The animal must be clean, washed, perfumed, unblemished, uninjured, undefiled. Whatever goes to the gods must be pure. Or, in other words: purity is whatever gets devoured by the gods.\nRitual sacrifice isn’t such a big deal in contemporary Hinduism. But Dumont keeps finding inconvenient traces of it scattered about the caste system. Cows keep wandering into his alleyways. In that chart above, he has to distinguish between ‘kacca’ and ‘pakka’ foods. Pakka is safer than kacca; you can take it from lower castes. The difference is that kacca is food boiled in water, and pakka is fried in ghee. It’s shielded from contamination thanks to ‘the protective role of butter, a product of the cow.’ The system of mutual independence between castes in a single village—the barbers cut the tailors’ hair, the tailors cut the barbers’ suits, the blacksmiths make their scissors—is called the jajmani system. But the word jajman doesn’t have anything to do with bucolic village communities. It comes from the Sanskrit yajamāna, which refers to the person who commissions an animal sacrifice. In fact, the entire hierarchy of varnas originally centred around animal sacrifice. Vaishyas raise the cattle, Kshatriyas sponsor the festival, but only a Brahmin can actually plunge the knife into the animal’s neck. Today, of course, killing a cow is unthinkable. But Dumont does stumble on another weird parallel. The two worst crimes imaginable are the murder of a cow and the murder of a Brahmin. Their lives are, in some way, equivalent.\nJust like Marx said, the caste system was called forth by a crude form of the division of labour. But that labour didn’t produce ordinary use-values: it produced sacrifices, flesh for the gods. It also no longer exists, not in any large-scale way, even if people like Raja still send the odd goat to Bhairava. Animal sacrifice declined, and the caste system emerged to replace it—with the position of the sacrificed animal, the pure and unpolluted meal for the gods, taken over by the Brahmin himself. Meanwhile, the Brahmin’s original functions—slaughtering cattle, butchering cattle, cutting the skin of cattle—were displaced onto the absolute lowest and most despised members of society. And around the same time, Hindu texts—which had, in the Vedic period, had very little to say about the subject—suddenly start talking almost incessantly about reincarnation and the transmigration of souls.\nWhatever you’ve been told, India is not a fixed, hierarchical society. In fact, it has an extraordinary rate of social mobility. It’s just that instead of escaping poverty within your lifetime, you move up in the world through the mechanism of death and reincarnation. The caste system is a ladder. You don’t advance by being good, exactly: every social stratum has its dharma, the role it has to play within the social whole. The dharma of the king is to rule; the dharma of the barber-caste is to cut hair; the dharma of an airport security officer is to steal your shampoo; the dharma of a prostitute is to corrupt the souls of men; the dharma of an untouchable is to live in miserable squalor in the wastelands out of sight. Conform to your role, and in your next life you’ll be born a little purer, a little more refined, a little higher up the chain. It might take ten billion lifetimes, but once you reach the very top your purity is impeccable. You are clean. You are unblemished. There is nowhere else to go. You have made yourself a meal fit for the gods.\nThe whole of society is one huge sacrifice ritual. Maybe it’s the same for all systems of purity and stratification. Virtue politics, being a decent person, class society and its inequalities: a cleansing before the slaughter.\nAbout an hour’s drive into the desert from Jaisalmer are the ruins of Kuldhara. One well-preserved temple and a few half-crumbled mansions in a landscape of broken walls. In the thirteenth century, this village was settled by the Paliwals, a Brahmin clan from the east. They lived there for hundreds of years, until, one night in 1823, the entire population vanished. They left their gold and their jewels and their lentils cooking over the fire. No bodies were ever found. At the very top of the class system there stands Kali, her fangs dripping with blood, the consumer of souls.\n\n\n\n\nThis edition of Numb in India is free, but the others aren’t.

This week we look at some Construction Physics email stats, why appliances break so often, a special economic zone for Silicon valley, a river filtering pool, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the newsletter is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><p>A few housekeeping items:</p><ul><li><p>I had planned to publish an essay about high housing costs in western states this week, but for various schedule reasons this got pushed till next week.</p></li><li><p>I was (briefly) on <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/06/17/american-shipbuilding-foundered-in-the-last-century-will-a-bipartisan-push-revive-it\">NPR&#8217;s Marketplace</a> talking about shipbuilding this week.</p></li></ul><h5>Substack data</h5><p>I vibe coded a little script to analyze the Construction Physics email list. The most surprising thing I discovered was how large the number of people who never open a single email are: over 25% of subscribers. What&#8217;s more, more than 10% of subscribers have never even received an email. I believe some of the latter is due to some email clients blocking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_pixel\">tracking pixels</a>, and some due to people signing up via the app and declining to receive emails, but not sure how much of either.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png\" width=\"503\" height=\"454\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:454,&quot;width&quot;:503,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_FsZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe4f1bfd8-cb9e-43d8-929c-2b472ecd627e_503x454.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The other notable pattern is how bimodal open rates are. Most subscribers either open almost every email, or open almost none of the emails.</p><p>If you have a substack and are interested in analyzing your own email list, I&#8217;ve made the script available on <a href=\"https://github.com/briancpotter/substackstats/tree/main\">github here</a>. It&#8217;s easy to use if you have python installed: download your full email list (check &#8220;Export all columns&#8221;), then rename the file full_email.csv. Put the script in the same directory as the csv file, and run it. It will output a text file with the analysis. The output includes some simple analytics, as well as a count of subscribers from things like governments, media outlets, major corporations, and major universities. I&#8217;d be very interested in seeing the stats from anyone who decides to run it.</p><h5>Iberian Peninsula blackout report</h5><p>The preliminary official report on the causes of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iberian_Peninsula_blackout\">Iberian Peninsula blackout</a> in April of this year has been released (it can be found <a href=\"https://media.licdn.com/dms/document/media/v2/D4D1FAQGcyyYYrelkNg/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/B4DZeBtlohGsAk-/0/1750227910090?e=1750896000&amp;v=beta&amp;t=uEftse3BPsTjdLQ3DmjoVkadhUGqf7-MfYj_6UnSS28\">here</a>). The report is 182 pages and (bizarrely) doesn&#8217;t have anything like an abstract or an executive summary. It&#8217;s also just difficult to read in general. Here&#8217;s a Claude 4 Sonnet-generated summary (full conversation <a href=\"https://claude.ai/share/dd0fc9af-5c6e-4fdb-b1fc-ac123ceaa257\">available here</a>): the key factor seems to be insufficient thermal power plants (nuclear, gas, coal) online to provide voltage control:</p><blockquote><p><em>On April 28, 2025, at 12:33:30, the Spanish and Portuguese electrical systems experienced a complete voltage collapse that disconnected them from the European grid, affecting over 47 million people. The comprehensive investigation revealed that this unprecedented event resulted from a complex cascade of overvoltages&#8212;a \"chain reaction\" where high voltages caused generation facilities to disconnect for protection, which paradoxically caused voltages to rise even further, triggering more disconnections until the entire system collapsed. At the time of the incident, the system was operating under challenging conditions: demand was relatively low at 25,184 MW (compared to the historical peak of 44,876 MW), renewable generation comprised 82% of the mix with nuclear providing 10% and the remainder from gas, coal, and cogeneration, while 2,978 MW of pumped storage was consuming power to take advantage of low market prices.</em></p><p><em>The root cause was insufficient dynamic voltage control capability in the system. Only 11 thermal power plants were coupled with voltage control obligations&#8212;the lowest number recorded all year and fewer than the 12 originally planned due to an unplanned outage the previous evening in the critical southwestern zone. This shortage was compounded by evidence that several voltage-controlling generators failed to absorb the expected amounts of reactive power during high-voltage conditions, with one facility in the south zone behaving markedly differently from both other plants and its own historical performance. The system was further destabilized by two significant oscillations: first at 12:03 with an unusual 0.6 Hz frequency (attributed to anomalous behavior at a specific photovoltaic installation), followed by a more typical 0.2 Hz inter-area oscillation at 12:19 where the Iberian Peninsula oscillated against central Europe.</em></p><p><em>The final collapse sequence began at 12:32 when voltages started rising linearly across the transmission network, climbing from 413 kV to 428 kV in just 57 seconds at some substations. Three major generation loss events occurred in rapid succession: 355 MW lost at 12:32:57 in Granada, 730 MW lost at 12:33:16 in Badajoz, and 550 MW lost at 12:33:17 in Seville. Each disconnection reduced the system's ability to absorb reactive power and decreased line loading, both effects that further increased voltages and accelerated the cascade. Within approximately 12 seconds, the system had lost sufficient generation that it could no longer maintain synchronization with France, ultimately leading to complete voltage collapse throughout the peninsula.</em></p></blockquote><p>The lack of voltage control, in turn, seems to be in part a regulatory issue:</p><blockquote><p><em>Voltage control fundamentally depends on managing reactive power&#8212;the non-useful component of electrical energy that doesn't perform work but is essential for maintaining proper voltage levels. Synchronous generators can both produce and absorb large amounts of reactive power independently of their active power output. More importantly, they can do this dynamically in response to grid conditions.</em></p><p><em>The report explains that thermal plants provide \"dynamic voltage control by setpoint\"&#8212;they continuously monitor grid voltage and automatically adjust their reactive power output to maintain voltage within target ranges. As the report notes: \"the higher the overvoltage, the greater the reactive power that must be absorbed by the generation to help contain the voltage.\" This is like having an automatic voltage regulator that responds in real-time to changing conditions.</em></p><p><em>While renewable technologies have been technologically capable of voltage control for years, they are currently regulated differently. Under Spanish regulations (Royal Decree 413/2014), renewables must operate at a fixed power factor (typically 0.98), meaning their reactive power output is directly proportional to their active power generation. When solar output drops due to clouds or market signals, their reactive power absorption drops proportionally, contributing to voltage increases&#8212;exactly what happened during the April 28 event.</em></p><p><em>The report specifically identifies this as a critical issue: \"a reduction in generation from fixed power factor technologies puts a double upward pressure on voltage (lower reactive power absorption, and higher reactive power production in less loaded grids).\" This is why the system became vulnerable when renewable generation decreased while thermal generation remained insufficient to compensate.</em></p></blockquote><h5>Federal land auction</h5><p>A huge fraction of land in the western half of the US (ranging from <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/2/16/8046349/federal-government-land-by-state\">30 to 80%</a> depending on the state) is owned by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_lands\">federal government</a>. Much of this land is protected (National Parks, Forests, and Wildlife Refuges), but much of it is also used for things like grazing cattle and drilling for oil. Every so often a proposal comes along to sell some federal land: now one is being considered as a way to raise money as part of the &#8220;Big Beautiful Bill&#8221; making its way through congress.

This week we look at some Construction Physics email stats, why appliances break so often, a special economic zone for Silicon valley, a river filtering pool, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the newsletter is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nA few housekeeping items:\n\nI had planned to publish an essay about high housing costs in western states this week, but for various schedule reasons this got pushed till next week.\n\nI was (briefly) on NPR’s Marketplace talking about shipbuilding this week.\nSubstack data\nI vibe coded a little script to analyze the Construction Physics email list. The most surprising thing I discovered was how large the number of people who never open a single email are: over 25% of subscribers. What’s more, more than 10% of subscribers have never even received an email. I believe some of the latter is due to some email clients blocking tracking pixels, and some due to people signing up via the app and declining to receive emails, but not sure how much of either.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe other notable pattern is how bimodal open rates are. Most subscribers either open almost every email, or open almost none of the emails.\nIf you have a substack and are interested in analyzing your own email list, I’ve made the script available on github here. It’s easy to use if you have python installed: download your full email list (check “Export all columns”), then rename the file full_email.csv. Put the script in the same directory as the csv file, and run it. It will output a text file with the analysis. The output includes some simple analytics, as well as a count of subscribers from things like governments, media outlets, major corporations, and major universities. I’d be very interested in seeing the stats from anyone who decides to run it.\nIberian Peninsula blackout report\nThe preliminary official report on the causes of the Iberian Peninsula blackout in April of this year has been released (it can be found here). The report is 182 pages and (bizarrely) doesn’t have anything like an abstract or an executive summary. It’s also just difficult to read in general. Here’s a Claude 4 Sonnet-generated summary (full conversation available here): the key factor seems to be insufficient thermal power plants (nuclear, gas, coal) online to provide voltage control:\n\nOn April 28, 2025, at 12:33:30, the Spanish and Portuguese electrical systems experienced a complete voltage collapse that disconnected them from the European grid, affecting over 47 million people. The comprehensive investigation revealed that this unprecedented event resulted from a complex cascade of overvoltages—a \"chain reaction\" where high voltages caused generation facilities to disconnect for protection, which paradoxically caused voltages to rise even further, triggering more disconnections until the entire system collapsed. At the time of the incident, the system was operating under challenging conditions: demand was relatively low at 25,184 MW (compared to the historical peak of 44,876 MW), renewable generation comprised 82% of the mix with nuclear providing 10% and the remainder from gas, coal, and cogeneration, while 2,978 MW of pumped storage was consuming power to take advantage of low market prices.\nThe root cause was insufficient dynamic voltage control capability in the system. Only 11 thermal power plants were coupled with voltage control obligations—the lowest number recorded all year and fewer than the 12 originally planned due to an unplanned outage the previous evening in the critical southwestern zone. This shortage was compounded by evidence that several voltage-controlling generators failed to absorb the expected amounts of reactive power during high-voltage conditions, with one facility in the south zone behaving markedly differently from both other plants and its own historical performance. The system was further destabilized by two significant oscillations: first at 12:03 with an unusual 0.6 Hz frequency (attributed to anomalous behavior at a specific photovoltaic installation), followed by a more typical 0.2 Hz inter-area oscillation at 12:19 where the Iberian Peninsula oscillated against central Europe.\nThe final collapse sequence began at 12:32 when voltages started rising linearly across the transmission network, climbing from 413 kV to 428 kV in just 57 seconds at some substations. Three major generation loss events occurred in rapid succession: 355 MW lost at 12:32:57 in Granada, 730 MW lost at 12:33:16 in Badajoz, and 550 MW lost at 12:33:17 in Seville. Each disconnection reduced the system's ability to absorb reactive power and decreased line loading, both effects that further increased voltages and accelerated the cascade. Within approximately 12 seconds, the system had lost sufficient generation that it could no longer maintain synchronization with France, ultimately leading to complete voltage collapse throughout the peninsula.\nThe lack of voltage control, in turn, seems to be in part a regulatory issue:\n\nVoltage control fundamentally depends on managing reactive power—the non-useful component of electrical energy that doesn't perform work but is essential for maintaining proper voltage levels. Synchronous generators can both produce and absorb large amounts of reactive power independently of their active power output. More importantly, they can do this dynamically in response to grid conditions.\nThe report explains that thermal plants provide \"dynamic voltage control by setpoint\"—they continuously monitor grid voltage and automatically adjust their reactive power output to maintain voltage within target ranges. As the report notes: \"the higher the overvoltage, the greater the reactive power that must be absorbed by the generation to help contain the voltage.\" This is like having an automatic voltage regulator that responds in real-time to changing conditions.\nWhile renewable technologies have been technologically capable of voltage control for years, they are currently regulated differently. Under Spanish regulations (Royal Decree 413/2014), renewables must operate at a fixed power factor (typically 0.98), meaning their reactive power output is directly proportional to their active power generation. When solar output drops due to clouds or market signals, their reactive power absorption drops proportionally, contributing to voltage increases—exactly what happened during the April 28 event.\nThe report specifically identifies this as a critical issue: \"a reduction in generation from fixed power factor technologies puts a double upward pressure on voltage (lower reactive power absorption, and higher reactive power production in less loaded grids).\" This is why the system became vulnerable when renewable generation decreased while thermal generation remained insufficient to compensate.\nFederal land auction\nA huge fraction of land in the western half of the US (ranging from 30 to 80% depending on the state) is owned by the federal government. Much of this land is protected (National Parks, Forests, and Wildlife Refuges), but much of it is also used for things like grazing cattle and drilling for oil. Every so often a proposal comes along to sell some federal land: now one is being considered as a way to raise money as part of the “Big Beautiful Bill” making its way through congress. From the New York Times:\n\nSenate Republicans are resurrecting a plan to sell millions of acres of federal lands as part of President Trump’s giant tax and spending bill, setting up a fight within the party.\nThe proposal would require the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service to identify and sell between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands across 11 Western states to build housing…\nThe new plan to sell public lands was included in draft legislation issued on Wednesday by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that is part of Mr. Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” The draft envisions raising as much as $10 billion by selling land for housing in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming over the next five years.\nAnd the Wall Street Journal gives a bit more information here:\n\nThe areas up for sale would exclude land with dedicated uses such as national parks and monuments, and land previously leased for mining, energy production and other activities. The plan directs federal agencies to prioritize selling land that is near existing roads or suitable for home-building. Agencies would consult governors before auctioning land in their states, and state and local governments would have the right to make an offer before private bidders.\nA map of the lands planned to be eligible for sale is available at Wilderness.org\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe idea that this will be used for “housing” seems somewhat dubious to me: most of this is BLM or Forest Service land that isn’t anywhere near places where there’s actual demand for housing. But some of it does seem to be near developed areas: scrolling around on the map reveals a few locations where there’s large BLM or FS tracts across the road from residential developments.

They conclude it’s a mix of survivorship bias (most old appliances didn’t have all that great lifespans), government regulations (and consumer desires) requiring constant product changes, and competition driving down the quality of parts and repairability.\n\nRegulations have improved appliances by many measures: They’ve removed leaky pilot lights in gas stoves, replaced ozone-depleting freon in refrigerators, prevented cooktop fires and burns through safety sensors and better insulation, and reduced water and power used by washers and dishwashers exponentially, saving consumers money.\nBut on top of that, they have generally added layers of complexity to appliances that had previously stayed the same for decades, said Zilka, the repair-industry veteran.\nThe main culprit is the set of efficiency standards for water and energy use for all cooking, refrigeration, and cleaning appliances.

      "content": "<p>To operate reliably, the US electrical grid needs to balance supply and demand: to make sure, at any given moment, that the amount of electricity demanded by homes, businesses, and factories is equal to the amount being supplied by nuclear reactors, gas turbines, and other types of power plants. Historically, this was done by connecting and disconnecting power plants, or ramping their output up and down as demand rises and falls. Some power plants might operate at full output nearly continuously (&#8220;baseload&#8221; generation, like nuclear), while others might only be ramped up when demand spikes (&#8220;peaker&#8221; plants, like gas turbines) and ramped down when no longer needed.</p><p>Today, electrical grids have a new tool for balancing supply and demand and ensuring grid reliability: batteries. Because of their ability to charge and discharge, and because they can be ramped up to full power quickly, batteries excel at the grid-balancing tasks required to ensure electricity supply always equals demand, as well as letting us match supply and demand with intermittent sources of generation like wind and solar. With batteries, reliably meeting electricity demand can be done without relying solely on traditional, turbine-based power plants.</p><p>Battery storage is growing rapidly in the US. Between 2013 and 2023, battery storage power capacity <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/\">increased by a factor of 100</a>, and energy (power x time) capacity increased by a factor of 275. By the end of 2023 there were about 16 gigawatts of battery power capacity on the grid, equivalent to about 16 large nuclear reactors.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> In some states, like California and Texas, the rapid growth of battery storage has made batteries an increasingly important tool for maintaining a reliable grid.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JsbhF/2/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c0287c28-7867-4906-9bb2-676e0312ef08_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:442,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;US Large-Scale Battery Storage Capacity&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Power and energy capacity of grid-scale battery storage.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JsbhF/2/\" width=\"730\" height=\"442\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><h4>A reliable grid means balancing supply and demand</h4><p>Operating the power grid requires balancing supply and demand: ensuring that at any given moment, the load on the grid is matched by supply from various sources of electricity generation. If supply and demand don&#8217;t match, the result can be blackouts, brownouts, or damage to electrical equipment connected to the grid. At a high level, this means making sure electricity generation connects to the grid when demand goes up, and disconnects when demand drops. To help maintain this balance, and ensure the grid is stable and reliable, grid operators pay power providers for what are known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancillary_services\">ancillary services</a>.&#8221;</p><p>Some of these services are designed to maintain the frequency of the grid. The electrical grid uses alternating current, which means the electrons \"slosh\" back and forth along power lines at a certain rate (60 cycles per second, or Hz, in the US). If this rate rises too high or falls too low, problems occur and the grid may shut down: the recent large-scale blackout in the Iberian Peninsula was caused when grid frequency suddenly dropped from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iberian_Peninsula_blackout\">50 Hz to 48 Hz</a>.</p><p>Maintaining a given frequency requires power supplied and power demanded to match. If energy supplied to the grid falls (or if power demand rises), the frequency of the grid will fall. The sudden drop in frequency on the Iberian grid followed <a href=\"https://kilovar1959.substack.com/p/the-iberian-blackout-on-that-day\">2200 megawatts of generation</a> getting disconnected. To maintain grid frequency, grid operators pay power providers to add power to the grid (&#8220;regulation up,&#8221; or regup) or remove power from the grid (&#8220;regulation down,&#8221; or regdown) to make constant, small adjustments to grid frequency.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>Regup and regdown services are used to provide minor frequency corrections to the grid, and require relatively small amounts of power. But grid operators also must have larger backup reserves in case of emergencies (such as a large power plant or transmission line suddenly getting disconnected from the grid). For this, grid operators require what&#8217;s known as &#8220;spinning&#8221; or &#8220;synchronized&#8221; reserves, sources of electricity generation that can be brought online very quickly, typically in less than 10 minutes. (Historically, these were called spinning reserves because they often consisted of a power plant that was already on &#8212; the turbine and generator were already spinning). There are also non-spinning or non-synchronized reserves: emergency sources of generation that take longer to come online. (These might still be conventional power plants with spinning turbines and generators, just ones that aren&#8217;t immediately able to provide power.)</p><p>Regulation up/down and spinning/non-spinning reserves are commonly purchased by most grid operators, but some operators also have markets for additional ancillary services. California&#8217;s CAISO, for instance, has a market for <a href=\"https://www.caiso.com/Documents/Report-FlexibleRampingProductPerformance.pdf\">Flexible Ramping</a> (generation sources that can come online if planned resources are unable to). Texas&#8217; ERCOT has a more granular emergency reserves market, which in addition to spinning/non-spinning includes a market for <a href=\"https://www.ercot.com/news/release/2023-06-12-ercot-adds-new\">Contingency Reserves</a> to address potential forecasting errors.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><h4>Batteries help balance supply and demand</h4><p>Batteries are very good at supplying many of these grid stability services. A battery at a partial state of charge can either supply power to the grid (by discharging) or take power off the grid (by charging), making them extremely well-suited to providing regulation up and regulation down services. Batteries can also ramp up to full power extremely quickly (fractions of a second), making them excellent at providing &#8220;spinning&#8221; reserves (though of course there is no physical spinning at all). A recent <a href=\"https://www.nerc.com/pa/RAPA/PA/Performance%20Analysis%20DL/NERC_SOR_2025_Overview.pdf\">North American Electrical Reliability Council (NERC) report</a> noted that the use of battery storage systems may improve frequency control and response. And because batteries have <a href=\"https://modoenergy.com/research/ercot-battery-energy-storage-systems-ancillary-service-prices-volumes-offer-prices-saturation\">lower marginal costs</a> than other sources of power generation (no fuel, less maintenance), they can often supply these services for less cost than traditional sources of generation.</p><div

In California, battery storage adoption has been driven by commitments to remove carbon-emitting sources of electricity generation. SB 100, passed in 2018, requires California to achieve <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article218128485.html\">100% carbon-free electricity by 2045</a>. An SB 100 report estimated that this will require on the order of <a href=\"https://www.caiso.com/about/news/energy-matters-blog/enhancing-resource-adequacy\">50 GW of battery storage</a>. In Texas, by contrast, battery storage adoption has been accelerated by ERCOT&#8217;s electricity market. While many grid operators have what&#8217;s known as &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ferc.gov/understanding-wholesale-capacity-markets\">capacity markets</a>&#8221; (in essence, paying providers to provide power that might be needed), ERCOT operates an <a href=\"https://www.gotrhythm.com/blog/ercot-wholesale-pricing-dynamics-2023\">&#8220;energy only&#8221; market</a>: generators are only paid for the power they provide. In the absence of capacity markets, the price for electricity in such a market can fluctuate much more, creating significant opportunities for battery storage operators to buy power when it's cheap and resell it when it's expensive.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cjw1X/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72b7f451-09b8-4a94-90bc-3942bff079c1_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:440,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Battery Storage Power Capacity By Grid Operator&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Cumulative installed capacity, in megawatts.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cjw1X/1/\" width=\"730\" height=\"440\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p>For both California and Texas, the result has been an enormous increase in battery storage capacity. As of 2023 CAISO operates around 50% of the US&#8217;s 16 gigawatts of battery storage, and ERCOT operates just under 25%, compared to PJM&#8217;s 2.3%. As with PJM, early on much of this battery storage capacity was used to provide ancillary services. In 2020, over 80% of CAISO&#8217;s and 90% of ERCOT&#8217;s battery capacity was being used for regup, regdown, and spinning reserves. By 2023, roughly 2/3rds of regup and responsive reserve services in Texas were being <a href=\"https://blog.gridstatus.io/batteries-ercot-ancillary-services-2024/\">provided by battery storage</a>, and in 2023 <a href=\"https://www.caiso.com/documents/department-of-market-monitoring-update-jul-2024.pdf\">batteries provided</a> 63% of CAISO&#8217;s regdown and 80% of its regup.</p><h4>Batteries and peak shaving</h4><p>Ancillary services are key for keeping the grid reliable, but many of them require a relatively small amount of power. Battery capacity has grown to such an extent in CAISO and ERCOT that it now greatly exceeds what&#8217;s needed to provide ancillary services. The 63% and 80% of regdown and regup services provided by batteries in California in 2023, for instance, were provided by just 16% and 8% of California&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/california-energy-storage-system-survey\">8 GW of battery storage capacity.</a><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>Rather than provide these sorts of services, batteries in California and Texas are increasingly being used for energy arbitrage: buying power when it&#8217;s cheap (such as the middle of a sunny day when output from solar panels is high), and selling it when it&#8217;s expensive (such as the evening when demand rises and output from solar panels falls). In ERCOT for instance, in 2023 only 15% of battery revenues came from energy arbitrage; by 2024 that had <a href=\"https://www.ess-news.com/2025/05/15/is-texas-battery-landscape-really-saturated/\">risen to 60%</a>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png\" width=\"926\" height=\"452\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:452,&quot;width&quot;:926,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:93242,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.construction-physics.com/i/166268138?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!nZr9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32c44ee9-de75-4772-8856-45e7f4b4ff8d_926x452.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This energy arbitrage allows grids to make use of excess solar or wind energy that would otherwise simply be wasted (known as &#8220;curtailment&#8221;). But it also makes energy grids more reliable. By storing excess power, batteries can help supply power during periods of peak demand, reducing the overall burden on other sources of generation (as well as <a href=\"https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/charging-up-the-state-of-utility-scale-electricity-storage-in-the-united-states/\">transmission lines</a>, if batteries are built near sources of load) and reducing the risk that demand may exceed supply.</p><p>In Texas, the increase in battery storage has been credited with helping reduce the risk for summer power outages. In 2023, Texas&#8217; ERCOT issued 11 conservation calls (requests for consumers to reduce their use of electricity), including <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2024/12/ACP_Storage-in-ERCOT_2024_Analysis.pdf\">7 during late August,</a> to avoid reliability problems amidst high summer temperatures. But in 2024 it issued no conservation calls during the summer. In part <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2024/12/ACP_Storage-in-ERCOT_2024_Analysis.pdf\">this was due</a> to the rapid increase in battery storage, which rose by 4 gigawatts (roughly 50%) between January and June 2024. Not only did batteries help prevent capacity issues, but they also helped <a href=\"https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2024/12/ACP_Storage-in-ERCOT_2024_Analysis.pdf\">reduce electricity prices</a> during peak hours, and are credited with contributing towards more than $750 million in electricity cost savings for Texas consumers over this period. This coming August, ERCOT is forecasting a <a href=\"https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2025/06/05/MORA_August2025.pdf\">0.5% risk</a> of having to declare an emergency energy alert (EEA), down from a <a href=\"https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2024/06/07/MORA_August2024.pdf\">16% risk in 2024</a>. In part this is because demand is forecasted to be lower this August than last August, but it&#8217;s also because of an <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/texas-ercot-rolling-blackouts-summer-risk-20368146.php\">increase in battery storage capacity</a> (whose expected contribution in the highest-risk hours rose by a factor of 5 between 2024 and 2025). Battery storage has also been credited with helping to avoid any conservation calls during a recent <a href=\"https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/texas-ercot-power-grid-renewables-heat-wave-laws-20330854.php\">May heatwave in Texas</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;A few short years ago, a heat wave&#8230; could have led to conservation requests and risked rolling blackouts or power outages across Texas,&#8221; said Daniel Giese, Texas director of the Solar Energy Industries Association. &#8220;But times have changed for the better.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>The grid of 2025 has tools the system of 2022 did not: An influx of solar generation and battery storage that ERCOT could use to keep up with demand even though a number of natural gas- and coal-fired power plants were on maintenance and repair breaks typical for May.</em></p></blockquote><p>At its peak, battery storage provided <a href=\"https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2025-05-15\">4.17 GW</a> (over 6% of ERCOT&#8217;s total demand) to Texans during the May heatwave, nearly as much as was provided by <a href=\"https://bkvenergy.com/learning-center/nuclear-power-plants-in-texas/\">nuclear power</a>. This is up from <a href=\"https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2025-05-01\">2.5 GW (4.2%)</a> two weeks prior to the heatwave, and <a href=\"https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2024-05-15\">1 GW (1.6%)</a> at the same time the previous year.</p><p>In California, large-scale deployment of battery storage has <a href=\"https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/jul/16/californias-grid-passed-the-reliability-test-this-/\">similarly been credited</a> for helping the state meet demand during heatwaves.

Historically, these inverters have been what&#8217;s known as &#8220;grid following&#8221;: they require some other source of power, generally a large spinning generator, to establish an alternating current frequency, and then match that frequency. If frequency on the grid unexpectedly declines sharply (due to things like a transmission line or power plant suddenly getting disconnected), spinning generators will resist this change due to <a href=\"https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/73856.pdf\">inertia effects</a>: the heavy spinning generators will automatically and mechanically slow down, dumping a portion of their rotational energy into the grid. This counteracts the sudden drop in frequency and makes the grid more robust to sudden unexpected frequency disruptions.</p><p>Critically, grid-following inverter-based resources don&#8217;t have the capability of automatically stabilizing the grid via inertia effects. This has created concerns that large-scale deployment of inverter-based resources, and removing sources of inertia from the grid, will result in grid instabilities and power system failures. The recent Iberian Peninsula blackout has been blamed on having too many inverter-based resources (over 70% at the time of the blackout) and insufficient generation with inertia to counteract grid instabilities.</p><p>However, inverters, particularly battery inverters, can also be designed to be &#8220;grid forming,&#8221; capable of establishing a reference frequency.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a> Grid-forming inverters can counteract grid instabilities via what&#8217;s known as &#8220;synthetic inertia&#8221;: detecting sudden drops in frequency, and rapidly ramping up their power to counteract them. In fact, because of how batteries function, they can supply much more of this equivalent inertia than spinning generators. The inertia response of a spinning generator is a small fraction of its total capacity, and declines quickly. Batteries can supply 100% of their capacity as inertia response, and do so until they run out of charge. The inertia response provided by 1000 megawatts of spinning generation could be provided by just <a

      "script_text": "To operate reliably, the US electrical grid needs to balance supply and demand: to make sure, at any given moment, that the amount of electricity demanded by homes, businesses, and factories is equal to the amount being supplied by nuclear reactors, gas turbines, and other types of power plants. Historically, this was done by connecting and disconnecting power plants, or ramping their output up and down as demand rises and falls. Some power plants might operate at full output nearly continuously (“baseload” generation, like nuclear), while others might only be ramped up when demand spikes (“peaker” plants, like gas turbines) and ramped down when no longer needed.\nToday, electrical grids have a new tool for balancing supply and demand and ensuring grid reliability: batteries. Because of their ability to charge and discharge, and because they can be ramped up to full power quickly, batteries excel at the grid-balancing tasks required to ensure electricity supply always equals demand, as well as letting us match supply and demand with intermittent sources of generation like wind and solar. With batteries, reliably meeting electricity demand can be done without relying solely on traditional, turbine-based power plants.\nBattery storage is growing rapidly in the US. Between 2013 and 2023, battery storage power capacity increased by a factor of 100, and energy (power x time) capacity increased by a factor of 275. By the end of 2023 there were about 16 gigawatts of battery power capacity on the grid, equivalent to about 16 large nuclear reactors. 1 In some states, like California and Texas, the rapid growth of battery storage has made batteries an increasingly important tool for maintaining a reliable grid.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nA reliable grid means balancing supply and demand\nOperating the power grid requires balancing supply and demand: ensuring that at any given moment, the load on the grid is matched by supply from various sources of electricity generation. If supply and demand don’t match, the result can be blackouts, brownouts, or damage to electrical equipment connected to the grid. At a high level, this means making sure electricity generation connects to the grid when demand goes up, and disconnects when demand drops. To help maintain this balance, and ensure the grid is stable and reliable, grid operators pay power providers for what are known as \" ancillary services.”\nSome of these services are designed to maintain the frequency of the grid. The electrical grid uses alternating current, which means the electrons \"slosh\" back and forth along power lines at a certain rate (60 cycles per second, or Hz, in the US). If this rate rises too high or falls too low, problems occur and the grid may shut down: the recent large-scale blackout in the Iberian Peninsula was caused when grid frequency suddenly dropped from 50 Hz to 48 Hz.\nMaintaining a given frequency requires power supplied and power demanded to match. If energy supplied to the grid falls (or if power demand rises), the frequency of the grid will fall. The sudden drop in frequency on the Iberian grid followed 2200 megawatts of generation getting disconnected. To maintain grid frequency, grid operators pay power providers to add power to the grid (“regulation up,” or regup) or remove power from the grid (“regulation down,” or regdown) to make constant, small adjustments to grid frequency. 2\nRegup and regdown services are used to provide minor frequency corrections to the grid, and require relatively small amounts of power. But grid operators also must have larger backup reserves in case of emergencies (such as a large power plant or transmission line suddenly getting disconnected from the grid). For this, grid operators require what’s known as “spinning” or “synchronized” reserves, sources of electricity generation that can be brought online very quickly, typically in less than 10 minutes. (Historically, these were called spinning reserves because they often consisted of a power plant that was already on — the turbine and generator were already spinning). There are also non-spinning or non-synchronized reserves: emergency sources of generation that take longer to come online. (These might still be conventional power plants with spinning turbines and generators, just ones that aren’t immediately able to provide power.)\nRegulation up/down and spinning/non-spinning reserves are commonly purchased by most grid operators, but some operators also have markets for additional ancillary services. California’s CAISO, for instance, has a market for Flexible Ramping(generation sources that can come online if planned resources are unable to). Texas’ ERCOT has a more granular emergency reserves market, which in addition to spinning/non-spinning includes a market for Contingency Reserves to address potential forecasting errors. 3\nBatteries help balance supply and demand\nBatteries are very good at supplying many of these grid stability services. A battery at a partial state of charge can either supply power to the grid (by discharging) or take power off the grid (by charging), making them extremely well-suited to providing regulation up and regulation down services. Batteries can also ramp up to full power extremely quickly (fractions of a second), making them excellent at providing “spinning” reserves (though of course there is no physical spinning at all). A recent North American Electrical Reliability Council (NERC) report noted that the use of battery storage systems may improve frequency control and response. And because batteries have lower marginal costs than other sources of power generation (no fuel, less maintenance), they can often supply these services for less cost than traditional sources of generation.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBatteries vs conventional generation in addressing grid frequency disruptions, via NERC.\nBecause batteries excel at providing these services, and because providing them was often lucrative, ancillary services markets were an early driver of grid-scale battery adoption. 4 PJM, the largest power grid operator in the US, became an early leader in battery storage installations after it created a market for fast-responding frequency regulation in 2012. By 2016, PJM had more battery power capacity than any other grid operator in the US, most of which was short-duration (45 minute) batteries built for the purpose frequency regulation.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nSince 2016, PJM has been thoroughly eclipsed as the largest operator of battery storage by California’s CAISO and Texas’ ERCOT. In California, battery storage adoption has been driven by commitments to remove carbon-emitting sources of electricity generation. SB 100, passed in 2018, requires California to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045. An SB 100 report estimated that this will require on the order of 50 GW of battery storage. In Texas, by contrast, battery storage adoption has been accelerated by ERCOT’s electricity market. While many grid operators have what’s known as “ capacity markets ” (in essence, paying providers to provide power that might be needed), ERCOT operates an “energy only” market: generators are only paid for the power they provide. In the absence of capacity markets, the price for electricity in such a market can fluctuate much more, creating significant opportunities for battery storage operators to buy power when it's cheap and resell it when it's expensive.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nFor both California and Texas, the result has been an enormous increase in battery storage capacity. As of 2023 CAISO operates around 50% of the US’s 16 gigawatts of battery storage, and ERCOT operates just under 25%, compared to PJM’s 2.3%. As with PJM, early on much of this battery storage capacity was used to provide ancillary services. In 2020, over 80% of CAISO’s and 90% of ERCOT’s battery capacity was being used for regup, regdown, and spinning reserves. By 2023, roughly 2/3rds of regup and responsive reserve services in Texas were being provided by battery storage, and in 2023 batteries provided 63% of CAISO’s regdown and 80% of its regup.\nBatteries and peak shaving\nAncillary services are key for keeping the grid reliable, but many of them require a relatively small amount of power. Battery capacity has grown to such an extent in CAISO and ERCOT that it now greatly exceeds what’s needed to provide ancillary services. The 63% and 80% of regdown and regup services provided by batteries in California in 2023, for instance, were provided by just 16% and 8% of California’s 8 GW of battery storage capacity. 5\nRather than provide these sorts of services, batteries in California and Texas are increasingly being used for energy arbitrage: buying power when it’s cheap (such as the middle of a sunny day when output from solar panels is high), and selling it when it’s expensive (such as the evening when demand rises and output from solar panels falls). In ERCOT for instance, in 2023 only 15% of battery revenues came from energy arbitrage; by 2024 that had risen to 60%.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis energy arbitrage allows grids to make use of excess solar or wind energy that would otherwise simply be wasted (known as “curtailment”). But it also makes energy grids more reliable. By storing excess power, batteries can help supply power during periods of peak demand, reducing the overall burden on other sources of generation (as well as transmission lines, if batteries are built near sources of load) and reducing the risk that demand may exceed supply.\nIn Texas, the increase in battery storage has been credited with helping reduce the risk for summer power outages. In 2023, Texas’ ERCOT issued 11 conservation calls (requests for consumers to reduce their use of electricity), including 7 during late August, to avoid reliability problems amidst high summer temperatures. But in 2024 it issued no conservation calls during the summer. In part this was due to the rapid increase in battery storage, which rose by 4 gigawatts (roughly 50%) between January and June 2024. Not only did batteries help prevent capacity issues, but they also helped reduce electricity prices during peak hours, and are credited with contributing towards more than $750 million in electricity cost savings for Texas consumers over this period. This coming August, ERCOT is forecasting a 0.5% risk of having to declare an emergency energy alert (EEA), down from a 16% risk in 2024. In part this is because demand is forecasted to be lower this August than last August, but it’s also because of an increase in battery storage capacity(whose expected contribution in the highest-risk hours rose by a factor of 5 between 2024 and 2025). Battery storage has also been credited with helping to avoid any conservation calls during a recent May heatwave in Texas:\n\n“A few short years ago, a heat wave… could have led to conservation requests and risked rolling blackouts or power outages across Texas,” said Daniel Giese, Texas director of the Solar Energy Industries Association. “But times have changed for the better.”\nThe grid of 2025 has tools the system of 2022 did not: An influx of solar generation and battery storage that ERCOT could use to keep up with demand even though a number of natural gas- and coal-fired power plants were on maintenance and repair breaks typical for May.\nAt its peak, battery storage provided 4.17 GW(over 6% of ERCOT’s total demand) to Texans during the May heatwave, nearly as much as was provided by nuclear power. This is up from 2.5 GW (4.2%) two weeks prior to the heatwave, and 1 GW (1.6%) at the same time the previous year.\nIn California, large-scale deployment of battery storage has similarly been credited for helping the state meet demand during heatwaves. Between 2022 and 2024 peak power output of battery storage in the evening hours rose by roughly a factor of 4, from just over 1 GW to 5 GW. Batteries are now responsible for serving over 30% of California’s power demand for brief periods during evening hours.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nPrior to California’s large-scale battery storage deployment, generation from natural gas power plants spiked in the early evenings as output from solar PV declined. But thanks to battery storage, power output from natural gas in the evening hours declined by roughly 50% between 2021 and 2024. This has reduced the amount of natural gas capacity that needs to be kept online during the day.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the progression of battery use in California by looking at snapshots of their daily output. On June 1st 2019, battery storage output rapidly shifts back and forth, going from positive to negative as it helps regulate the grid frequency. Maximum discharge is less than 200 megawatts, and net contribution to meeting power demand is essentially zero.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nOn June 1st 2022, batteries are beginning to be used more for meeting load (peaking at around 4.5% of overall demand); the rapid charging and discharging to help regulate frequencies is now superimposed on a trend of negative load during the day (when batteries are charging) and positive load in the evenings. Discharge peak has risen from less than 0.2 GW to nearly 1.5 GW.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nOn June 1st 2025, this pattern is even more pronounced. Discharge peaks are even higher, over 6GW, and the overall shape of the charge/discharge pattern is much smoother. While in 2019 batteries were rapidly alternating between charging and discharging to help maintain frequency, now this variation is a small disturbance on an otherwise smooth pattern of charging during the day and discharging at night.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nBatteries and grid-forming\nBatteries, solar panels, and wind turbines are all “inverter-based resources” (IBRs): while power plants that spin a generator generate alternating current directly, IBRs generate direct current and convert it to alternating current using an inverter. Historically, these inverters have been what’s known as “grid following”: they require some other source of power, generally a large spinning generator, to establish an alternating current frequency, and then match that frequency. If frequency on the grid unexpectedly declines sharply (due to things like a transmission line or power plant suddenly getting disconnected), spinning generators will resist this change due to inertia effects: the heavy spinning generators will automatically and mechanically slow down, dumping a portion of their rotational energy into the grid. This counteracts the sudden drop in frequency and makes the grid more robust to sudden unexpected frequency disruptions.\nCritically, grid-following inverter-based resources don’t have the capability of automatically stabilizing the grid via inertia effects. This has created concerns that large-scale deployment of inverter-based resources, and removing sources of inertia from the grid, will result in grid instabilities and power system failures. The recent Iberian Peninsula blackout has been blamed on having too many inverter-based resources (over 70% at the time of the blackout) and insufficient generation with inertia to counteract grid instabilities.\nHowever, inverters, particularly battery inverters, can also be designed to be “grid forming,” capable of establishing a reference frequency. 6 Grid-forming inverters can counteract grid instabilities via what’s known as “synthetic inertia”: detecting sudden drops in frequency, and rapidly ramping up their power to counteract them. In fact, because of how batteries function, they can supply much more of this equivalent inertia than spinning generators. The inertia response of a spinning generator is a small fraction of its total capacity, and declines quickly. Batteries can supply 100% of their capacity as inertia response, and do so until they run out of charge. The inertia response provided by 1000 megawatts of spinning generation could be provided by just 120 megawatts of batteries.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nConventional inertia vs synthetic or digital inertia, via Everoze.\nBatteries with grid-forming inverters are relatively new, but are becoming more common. In the US, several batteries with grid-forming inverters have been installed in Hawaii, and US grid operators are working to standardize their requirements. They have also been installed in Ireland, Australia, Germany, and the UK. Grid-forming inverters will allow for very large levels of wind and solar penetration while maintaining grid stability: Ireland has achieved up to 75% of renewable generation in part by using grid-forming inverters and synthetic inertia. If properly designed, grid-forming inverters also let batteries provide other critical grid functions, such as black start (starting a grid from a state of zero power).\nConclusion\nThanks to their ability to rapidly charge and discharge, and to store electricity for when it’s most needed, batteries are becoming an important tool for making electrical grids reliable. While today grid-scale battery storage capacity is still small in absolute terms (energy storage supplied by batteries is about 43 gigawatt hours, less than 1/10th the energy storage capacity of pumped hydro plants in the US, and less than 1/100,000th the energy storage capacity for petroleum), in the absence of any sort of disruption, we can expect the values for battery storage to grow rapidly. Battery projects (either alone or paired with a source of generation) make up nearly half of planned electricity generation projects by capacity. There are 394 gigawatts of battery-only projects in the interconnection queue, or 25 times existing battery capacity on the grid. If it maintains its faster-than-Moore’s-Law current rate of growth (doubling about every 15 months), battery storage energy capacity will surpass pumped hydro as the largest source of grid-scale electrical storage around 2029. This will allow greater use of wind and solar resources, and help ensure grid reliability across the entire US. As batteries continue to be installed in greater numbers and the technology advances, we should expect them to take a larger and larger role in making our grid more reliable.\n1\n\nThough limited energy capacity means that batteries could only supply that power for a few hours\n2\n\nSometimes these are just called “regulation services.”\n3\n\nThough ERCOT calls it Rapid Reserve Service, not spinning reserves.\n4\n\nAn example of how lucrative ancillary services can be: in 2023 regup and regdown made up roughly 2/3rds of battery storage revenues in CAISO, despite only a small percentage of battery storage being used for these services\n5\n\nBattery storage power capacity at the end of 2023\n6\n\nIBRs can also provide inertia by adding synchronous condensers( large rotating motors with no load), but batteries will likely be much less expensive to deploy.",

This week we look at Figure&#8217;s new humanoid robot demo, what it would take to create the data for a robot foundation model, &#8220;right to repair&#8221; on naval vessels, electricity costs and power laws, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><p>No essay this week, but I&#8217;m working on a more involved one about housing costs in the western US that will be out next week.</p><h5>Supersonic flight executive order</h5><p>Supersonic flight over land has been banned in the US since <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasas-quesst-reassessing-a-50-year-supersonic-speed-limit/\">1973</a>, due to <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-did-supersonic-airliners-fail\">widespread opposition to sonic booms</a>. However, the way this was implemented was needlessly burdensome: rather than setting noise limits for supersonic aircraft, the ban prevented non-military aircraft from travelling faster than the speed of sound at all, even if they could do so without generating a sonic boom. The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/leading-the-world-in-supersonic-flight/\">new executive order</a> requires the FAA to repeal this regulation, and replace it with a noise-based standard:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law.</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m aware of various efforts for quieter supersonic travel, including NASA&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-59_Quesst\">X-59</a> and Boom Supersonic&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://spaceinsider.tech/2025/02/11/how-boom-supersonics-boomless-cruise-mode-works/\">boomless cruise</a>&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not an aerospace expert and I&#8217;m not sure how practical they&#8217;ll end up being. But regardless, replacing a burdensome prescriptive standard (&#8220;to minimize noise, you shall not travel faster than this&#8221;) with a performance-based one (&#8220;you shall make less noise than this&#8221;) seems very positive to me.</p><h5>Figure AI&#8217;s 1-hour humanoid demo</h5><p>Humanoid robot developer Figure AI released an hour-long video of one of their robots autonomously (no teleoperation) <a href=\"https://x.com/TheHumanoidHub/status/1931394946768249324\">scanning packages and placing them on a conveyor belt</a>:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png\" width=\"916\" height=\"512\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:512,&quot;width&quot;:916,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7c4747-5ab7-41f2-ae45-8bdcc17cfa0c_916x512.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This was apparently made possible due to improvements in Helix, the &#8220;Vision-Language-Action model&#8221; that powers Figure&#8217;s robots. From <a href=\"https://www.figure.ai/news/scaling-helix-logistics\">Figure</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Helix&#8217;s logistics policy has broadened to handle a much wider diversity of packages. In addition to standard rigid boxes, the system now manages polyethylene bags (poly bags), padded envelopes, and other deformable or thin parcels that pose unique challenges. These items can fold, crumple, or flex, making it harder to grasp and locate labels. Helix addresses this by adjusting its grasp strategy on the fly &#8211; for example, flicking away a soft bag to flip it dynamically, or using pinch grips for flat mailers. Despite the greater variety in shape and texture, Helix increased its throughput, processing items in about 4.05 seconds each on average without bottlenecks&#8230;</em></p><p><em>Helix&#8217;s policy now maintains a short-term visual memory of its environment, rather than acting only on instantaneous camera frames. Concretely, the model is equipped with a module that composes features from a sequence of recent video frames, giving it a temporally extended view of the scene&#8230;</em></p><p><em>We also augmented Helix&#8217;s proprioceptive input with a history of recent states, which has enabled faster, more reactive control. Originally, the policy operated in fixed-duration action chunks: it would observe the current state and output a short trajectory of motions, then observe anew, and so on. By incorporating a window of past robot states (hand, torso and head positions) into the policy&#8217;s input, the system maintains continuity between these action chunks&#8230;</em></p><p><em>To grant Helix a basic sense of touch, we integrated force feedback into the policy&#8217;s input observations. The forces that Figure 02 applies on its environment and the objects it manipulates are now part of the state fed into the neural network&#8230;</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not a robotics or AI expert, but this is probably the most impressive humanoid demonstration that I&#8217;ve seen from a <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/robot-dexterity-still-seems-hard\">dexterity standpoint</a>. It handles a variety of different object types of different rigidities (boxes, soft packages, thin envelopes) quickly and smoothly, for a very long period of time. (At one point it successfully picks up what looks like a thin piece of cardstock with the aid of a ramp.) The tasks aren&#8217;t incredibly dexterously demanding, but it&#8217;s still much more than I&#8217;ve seen other humanoid robots accomplish.</p><p>In other humanoid news, 1X Robotics released a <a href=\"https://x.com/TheHumanoidHub/status/1932864588648964459\">new demo</a> showing their Neo robot doing things like walking outside and climbing stairs.</p><h5>Robot foundation model training</h5><p>AI software, like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT and Anthropic&#8217;s Claude, are powered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model\">foundation models</a>: large neural network models trained on enormous amounts of data. These foundation models can then be used as a base for more specialized AI models trained to perform specific tasks (hence the name &#8220;foundation model&#8221;).</p><p>Efforts are underway to create similar foundation models for robotics, but a common bottleneck is the lack of availability of data. The models behind things like ChatGPT had the benefit of having the entire internet as their training data. GPT-3, for instance, was trained on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165\">300 billion tokens</a> (where a token is a chunk of data roughly equivalent to 3/4ths of a word), and it&#8217;s estimated that the training set for GPT-4 is in the trillions of tokens. No such easily accessible dataset currently exists for training robot foundation models.</p><p>On substack, Chris Paxton <a href=\"https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/how-can-we-get-enough-data-to-train\">estimates how much effort it would require</a> to create a large dataset that could be used to train a robot foundation model.</p><blockquote><p><em>Assume we have a robot that can collect 1 (valuable) token per frame at 10 frames per second. We make this assumption because, largely, robot tokens are not as valuable as LLM tokens - the information Qwen or Llama is trained on is very semantically rich, whereas robot frames often have a lot of redundant information. To put it another way: machine learning works best the closer you are to an independent and identically distributed (iid) dataset; neither web data nor robot data is iid, but robot data is far less iid than web data.</em></p><p><em>Okay, now let&#8217;s assume the robot collects its data all day, every day, forever. A year has 365.25 days &#215; 24 hours &#215; 3600 seconds = 31,557,600 seconds total; at 10 fps, to get to 2 trillion tokens, we need 6,377 years worth of data (rounding up).</em></p><p><em>Now, that&#8217;s assuming it runs 24/7, and is getting useful data every second of every day, which seems wildly implausible. Let&#8217;s say we 10x it, and then round up a bit more - call it 70,000 robot-years to get to our 2 trillion (useful) token llama2 dataset&#8230;</em></p></blockquote><p>Paxton estimates that getting the 2-trillion tokens needed for a robot GPT would require ~70,000 robot-years of training(!), but by using the data from 1000 robots, and augmenting real-world training data with simulated training data and videos of humans performing tasks, this could be achieved in less than a year. A multi-billion dollar project, to be sure, but one that&#8217;s achievable.</p><h5>Reconductoring</h5><p>Rising power demand requires lots of new electrical generation capacity, but it also requires more transmission lines to bring that power where it&#8217;s needed. Unfortunately, building transmission lines in the US has become <a href=\"https://ifp.org/how-cost-allocation-works-for-transmission-lines/\">more and more difficult</a>.</p><p>One possible way to cut this knot is to rewire existing transmission lines to have more capacity; this is known as &#8220;reconductoring&#8221;, and can involve using transmission lines with stronger composite cores, or with trapezoidal-shaped wires that can be more densely packed. An <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/06/11/reconductoring-building-tomorrows-grid-today/\">article on Hackaday explains how it works</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The point of composite cores is to provide the conductor with the necessary tensile strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient, so that heating due to loading and environmental conditions causes the cable to sag less. Controlling sag is critical to cable capacity; the less likely a cable is to sag when heated, the more load it can carry. Additionally, composite cores can have a smaller cross-sectional area than a steel core with the same tensile strength, leaving room for more aluminum in the outer layers while maintaining the same overall conductor diameter. And of course, more aluminum means these advanced conductors can carry more current.</em></p><p><em>Another way to increase the capacity in advanced conductors is by switching to trapezoidal wires. Traditional ACSR with round wires in the core and conductor layers has a significant amount of dielectric space trapped within the conductor, which contributes nothing to the cable&#8217;s current-carrying capacity. Filling those internal voids with aluminum is accomplished by wrapping round composite cores with aluminum wires that have a trapezoidal cross-section to pack tightly against each other. This greatly reduces the dielectric space trapped within a conductor, increasing its ampacity within the same overall diameter.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png\" width=\"577\" height=\"349.085\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:577,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Typical aluminum-conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) transmission line on the left, and a more densely packed aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC) on the right, via <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ACSR_and_ACCC.JPG\">Wikipedia</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-for-061425\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nPatient receiving radiation treatment at University of California Medical Center in the 1950s, via@sci_fi_infra.\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure and industrial technology. This week we look at Figure’s new humanoid robot demo, what it would take to create the data for a robot foundation model, “right to repair” on naval vessels, electricity costs and power laws, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nNo essay this week, but I’m working on a more involved one about housing costs in the western US that will be out next week.\nSupersonic flight executive order\nSupersonic flight over land has been banned in the US since 1973, due to widespread opposition to sonic booms. However, the way this was implemented was needlessly burdensome: rather than setting noise limits for supersonic aircraft, the ban prevented non-military aircraft from travelling faster than the speed of sound at all, even if they could do so without generating a sonic boom. The new executive order requires the FAA to repeal this regulation, and replace it with a noise-based standard:\n\nThe Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law.\nI’m aware of various efforts for quieter supersonic travel, including NASA’s X-59 and Boom Supersonic’s “ boomless cruise ”, but I’m not an aerospace expert and I’m not sure how practical they’ll end up being. But regardless, replacing a burdensome prescriptive standard (“to minimize noise, you shall not travel faster than this”) with a performance-based one (“you shall make less noise than this”) seems very positive to me.\nFigure AI’s 1-hour humanoid demo\nHumanoid robot developer Figure AI released an hour-long video of one of their robots autonomously (no teleoperation) scanning packages and placing them on a conveyor belt:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis was apparently made possible due to improvements in Helix, the “Vision-Language-Action model” that powers Figure’s robots. From Figure:\n\nHelix’s logistics policy has broadened to handle a much wider diversity of packages. In addition to standard rigid boxes, the system now manages polyethylene bags (poly bags), padded envelopes, and other deformable or thin parcels that pose unique challenges. These items can fold, crumple, or flex, making it harder to grasp and locate labels. Helix addresses this by adjusting its grasp strategy on the fly – for example, flicking away a soft bag to flip it dynamically, or using pinch grips for flat mailers. Despite the greater variety in shape and texture, Helix increased its throughput, processing items in about 4.05 seconds each on average without bottlenecks…\nHelix’s policy now maintains a short-term visual memory of its environment, rather than acting only on instantaneous camera frames. Concretely, the model is equipped with a module that composes features from a sequence of recent video frames, giving it a temporally extended view of the scene…\nWe also augmented Helix’s proprioceptive input with a history of recent states, which has enabled faster, more reactive control. Originally, the policy operated in fixed-duration action chunks: it would observe the current state and output a short trajectory of motions, then observe anew, and so on. By incorporating a window of past robot states (hand, torso and head positions) into the policy’s input, the system maintains continuity between these action chunks…\nTo grant Helix a basic sense of touch, we integrated force feedback into the policy’s input observations. The forces that Figure 02 applies on its environment and the objects it manipulates are now part of the state fed into the neural network…\nI’m not a robotics or AI expert, but this is probably the most impressive humanoid demonstration that I’ve seen from a dexterity standpoint. It handles a variety of different object types of different rigidities (boxes, soft packages, thin envelopes) quickly and smoothly, for a very long period of time. (At one point it successfully picks up what looks like a thin piece of cardstock with the aid of a ramp.) The tasks aren’t incredibly dexterously demanding, but it’s still much more than I’ve seen other humanoid robots accomplish.\nIn other humanoid news, 1X Robotics released a new demo showing their Neo robot doing things like walking outside and climbing stairs.\nRobot foundation model training\nAI software, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude, are powered by foundation models: large neural network models trained on enormous amounts of data. These foundation models can then be used as a base for more specialized AI models trained to perform specific tasks (hence the name “foundation model”).\nEfforts are underway to create similar foundation models for robotics, but a common bottleneck is the lack of availability of data. The models behind things like ChatGPT had the benefit of having the entire internet as their training data. GPT-3, for instance, was trained on 300 billion tokens(where a token is a chunk of data roughly equivalent to 3/4ths of a word), and it’s estimated that the training set for GPT-4 is in the trillions of tokens. No such easily accessible dataset currently exists for training robot foundation models.\nOn substack, Chris Paxton estimates how much effort it would require to create a large dataset that could be used to train a robot foundation model.\n\nAssume we have a robot that can collect 1 (valuable) token per frame at 10 frames per second. We make this assumption because, largely, robot tokens are not as valuable as LLM tokens - the information Qwen or Llama is trained on is very semantically rich, whereas robot frames often have a lot of redundant information. To put it another way: machine learning works best the closer you are to an independent and identically distributed (iid) dataset; neither web data nor robot data is iid, but robot data is far less iid than web data.\nOkay, now let’s assume the robot collects its data all day, every day, forever. A year has 365.25 days × 24 hours × 3600 seconds = 31,557,600 seconds total; at 10 fps, to get to 2 trillion tokens, we need 6,377 years worth of data (rounding up).\nNow, that’s assuming it runs 24/7, and is getting useful data every second of every day, which seems wildly implausible. Let’s say we 10x it, and then round up a bit more - call it 70,000 robot-years to get to our 2 trillion (useful) token llama2 dataset…\nPaxton estimates that getting the 2-trillion tokens needed for a robot GPT would require ~70,000 robot-years of training(!), but by using the data from 1000 robots, and augmenting real-world training data with simulated training data and videos of humans performing tasks, this could be achieved in less than a year. A multi-billion dollar project, to be sure, but one that’s achievable.\nReconductoring\nRising power demand requires lots of new electrical generation capacity, but it also requires more transmission lines to bring that power where it’s needed. Unfortunately, building transmission lines in the US has become more and more difficult.\nOne possible way to cut this knot is to rewire existing transmission lines to have more capacity; this is known as “reconductoring”, and can involve using transmission lines with stronger composite cores, or with trapezoidal-shaped wires that can be more densely packed. An article on Hackaday explains how it works:\n\nThe point of composite cores is to provide the conductor with the necessary tensile strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient, so that heating due to loading and environmental conditions causes the cable to sag less. Controlling sag is critical to cable capacity; the less likely a cable is to sag when heated, the more load it can carry. Additionally, composite cores can have a smaller cross-sectional area than a steel core with the same tensile strength, leaving room for more aluminum in the outer layers while maintaining the same overall conductor diameter. And of course, more aluminum means these advanced conductors can carry more current.\nAnother way to increase the capacity in advanced conductors is by switching to trapezoidal wires. Traditional ACSR with round wires in the core and conductor layers has a significant amount of dielectric space trapped within the conductor, which contributes nothing to the cable’s current-carrying capacity. Filling those internal voids with aluminum is accomplished by wrapping round composite cores with aluminum wires that have a trapezoidal cross-section to pack tightly against each other. This greatly reduces the dielectric space trapped within a conductor, increasing its ampacity within the same overall diameter.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nTypical aluminum-conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) transmission line on the left, and a more densely packed aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC) on the right, via Wikipedia.\nRead more",

Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><h5>Battery storage risks</h5><p>Looking at the trends in <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/\">battery storage growth</a>, and the number of battery projects in the <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/inside-the-interconnection-queue\">interconnection queue</a>, the future of the battery storage industry in the US seems like it would be bright. But apparently things are shakier than I realized. Battery storage integrator (sort of like a general contractor for battery storage) <a href=\"https://powin.com/\">Powin</a>, one of the largest storage integrators in the world, announced that its laying off 250 employees and suspending operators, apparently due to a combination of tariffs, potential tax credit repeal, and other issues. Via <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/powin-warns-of-shutdown/\">Latitude Media</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Powin designs, commissions and services utility-scale battery projects, positioning itself as what CEO Jeff Waters calls &#8220;that one throat to choke&#8221; for utilities and power producers deploying storage assets.</em></p><p><em>According to rankings from S&amp;P, Powin had the third most gigawatt-hours of batteries installed in the U.S., in 2024, and the fourth most globally.</em></p><p><em>In January, Clean Energy Associates issued an analysis showing how the battery storage industry faced &#8220;multiple layers of policy risk,&#8221; ranging from tariffs, tax credit repeal, and Chinese content exclusions. Some large battery projects have been delayed as a result.</em></p><p><em>Developers are waiting to see the outcome of budget reconciliation later this year before moving forward with projects. Meanwhile, procurement has become increasingly complex as companies try to navigate overlapping tariff regimes and domestic content requirements.</em></p></blockquote><p>Related, Wood Mackenzie has a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/tariffs-to-increase-costs-and-slow-down-development-for-us-power-industry/\">new report out</a> suggesting that tariffs could drive the costs of

an eye on this.</p><h5>Batteries in Pakistan</h5><p>In other battery news, we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-04122025\">previously noted</a> that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of solar PV installation in the entire world, in part due to an <a href=\"https://theelectricityhub.com/pakistans-solar-boom-market-power-vs-grid-strain/#:~:text=Pakistan's%20energy%20sector%20faces%20several,increase%20the%20demand%20for%20cooling.\">exceptionally unreliable power grid</a>. Now it&#8217;s apparently starting to pair these with battery storage systems. From the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b4c598e-a4b3-4c6e-9c38-97e46357f819\">Financial Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Companies can now recover their investment in transitioning to predominantly renewable energy &#8212; using solar, wind and batteries &#8212; in less than two years.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>The battery storage systems are still too expensive to be adopted as widely as solar has been in Pakistan in the near future. But distributors say prices are falling rapidly and demand continues to grow.</em></p><p><em>Faaz Diwan, director at Karachi-based Diwan International, one of Pakistan&#8217;s largest solar and battery distributors, said the cost of the BYD batteries he sold had fallen by more than a third since last year to about Rs275,000 for a 5kWh unit that is enough to power a small house.</em></p><p><em>His company has been importing more than 500 batteries a month since March, three times more than last year, as wealthier households, gyms, mosques and businesses gobble up storage systems to save money on air-conditioning ahead of summer.</em></p></blockquote><h5>&#8220;Affordable&#8221; housing</h5><p>&#8220;Affordable&#8221; housing in the US generally doesn&#8217;t mean housing that&#8217;s inexpensive to build and thus cheap: it means housing where the developer takes advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html\">Low-Income Housing Tax Credit</a> (a HUD program), or other similar credits, by allocating a certain number of housing units to people with low incomes. Ironically, the overhead of this program means that in practice, &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing can be incredibly expensive to build. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/06/these-publicly-funded-homes-poor-cost-12-million-each-develop/\">This article</a> from the Washington Post describes an &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing project has development costs of $1.2 million per unit, compared to just $350,000 per unit in a building built next door by the same developer, and digs into the reasons why:</p><blockquote><p><em>To make use of the credits, which lower a company&#8217;s tax liability dollar-for-dollar, developers typically partner with big companies, such as banks, that have tax liabilities big enough to benefit from them. While the credits are awarded in significant amounts &#8212; often tens of millions of dollars &#8212; developers typically have to augment them with various other funding sources. The resulting financing structures require small armies of lawyers and accountants to manage, driving up development costs.</em></p><p><em>While affordable housing developers and advocates privately acknowledge the program&#8217;s inefficiencies, they are reluctant to offer public criticism because, without it, tens of thousands of new affordable housing units per year would not be built.</em></p><p><em>Other cost drivers include wage requirements for construction workers that come with federal funding. There are also city requirements to hire local workers and bring on local small businesses. And the competition for public funds tends to produce smaller developments, so that the money can be spread around to numerous projects, which prevents developers from benefiting from economies of scale.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

effect superimposed on top of it. In counties with low population but a lot of scenic beauty, median income is probably low but median housing costs are probably high due to the presence of expensive vacation homes. This probably explains the big red blob on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina (home to the Blue Ridge Mountains), and the expensive coastal counties in Florida.</p><p>The other very obvious pattern here is how nearly every county west of the Rockies is extremely unafordable. I&#8217;m not sure how much of this is due to the above &#8220;scenic beauty vs low population&#8221; effect, and how much of it is high home prices broadly due to insufficient homebuilding.

Battery storage integrator (sort of like a general contractor for battery storage) Powin, one of the largest storage integrators in the world, announced that its laying off 250 employees and suspending operators, apparently due to a combination of tariffs, potential tax credit repeal, and other issues. Via Latitude Media:\n\nPowin designs, commissions and services utility-scale battery projects, positioning itself as what CEO Jeff Waters calls “that one throat to choke” for utilities and power producers deploying storage assets.\nAccording to rankings from S&P, Powin had the third most gigawatt-hours of batteries installed in the U.S., in 2024, and the fourth most globally.\nIn January, Clean Energy Associates issued an analysis showing how the battery storage industry faced “multiple layers of policy risk,” ranging from tariffs, tax credit repeal, and Chinese content exclusions. Some large battery projects have been delayed as a result.\nDevelopers are waiting to see the outcome of budget reconciliation later this year before moving forward with projects. Meanwhile, procurement has become increasingly complex as companies try to navigate overlapping tariff regimes and domestic content requirements.\nRelated, Wood Mackenzie has a new report out suggesting that tariffs could drive the costs of battery storage up by 45%.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear to me how representative the issues with Powin are of the industry more generally, but I’ll be keeping an eye on this.\nBatteries in Pakistan\nIn other battery news, we’ve previously noted that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of solar PV installation in the entire world, in part due to an exceptionally unreliable power grid. Now it’s apparently starting to pair these with battery storage systems. From the Financial Times:\n\n“Companies can now recover their investment in transitioning to predominantly renewable energy — using solar, wind and batteries — in less than two years.”\nThe battery storage systems are still too expensive to be adopted as widely as solar has been in Pakistan in the near future. But distributors say prices are falling rapidly and demand continues to grow.\nFaaz Diwan, director at Karachi-based Diwan International, one of Pakistan’s largest solar and battery distributors, said the cost of the BYD batteries he sold had fallen by more than a third since last year to about Rs275,000 for a 5kWh unit that is enough to power a small house.\nHis company has been importing more than 500 batteries a month since March, three times more than last year, as wealthier households, gyms, mosques and businesses gobble up storage systems to save money on air-conditioning ahead of summer.\n“Affordable” housing\n“Affordable” housing in the US generally doesn’t mean housing that’s inexpensive to build and thus cheap: it means housing where the developer takes advantage of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit(a HUD program), or other similar credits, by allocating a certain number of housing units to people with low incomes. Ironically, the overhead of this program means that in practice, “affordable” housing can be incredibly expensive to build. This article from the Washington Post describes an “affordable” housing project has development costs of $1.2 million per unit, compared to just $350,000 per unit in a building built next door by the same developer, and digs into the reasons why:\n\nTo make use of the credits, which lower a company’s tax liability dollar-for-dollar, developers typically partner with big companies, such as banks, that have tax liabilities big enough to benefit from them. While the credits are awarded in significant amounts — often tens of millions of dollars — developers typically have to augment them with various other funding sources. The resulting financing structures require small armies of lawyers and accountants to manage, driving up development costs.\nWhile affordable housing developers and advocates privately acknowledge the program’s inefficiencies, they are reluctant to offer public criticism because, without it, tens of thousands of new affordable housing units per year would not be built.\nOther cost drivers include wage requirements for construction workers that come with federal funding. There are also city requirements to hire local workers and bring on local small businesses. And the competition for public funds tends to produce smaller developments, so that the money can be spread around to numerous projects, which prevents developers from benefiting from economies of scale.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nUS housing affordability by county\nAlso on the subject of housing affordability, several years ago a redditor made this interesting map of US housing affordability by county, showing which counties have higher and lower ratios between median home price and median household income.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMaps like this often end up being just population maps in disguise, but this map has another effect superimposed on top of it. In counties with low population but a lot of scenic beauty, median income is probably low but median housing costs are probably high due to the presence of expensive vacation homes. This probably explains the big red blob on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina (home to the Blue Ridge Mountains), and the expensive coastal counties in Florida.\nThe other very obvious pattern here is how nearly every county west of the Rockies is extremely unafordable. I’m not sure how much of this is due to the above “scenic beauty vs low population” effect, and how much of it is high home prices broadly due to insufficient homebuilding. I can buy home shortages driving up prices in California, but is this really the case in Idaho, Utah, and Arizona?\nRead more",

The resulting legal dispute between Bell Telephone and Western Union (which owned the rights to Gray&#8217;s invention) would consume millions of dollars before being resolved in Bell&#8217;s favor in 1879.</p><p>Such cases of multiple invention are common, and some of the most famous and important modern inventions were invented in parallel. Both Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan patented incandescent lightbulbs in 1880. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce patented integrated circuits in 1959. Hans von Ohain and Frank Whittle independently invented the jet engine in the 1930s. In a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2142320.pdf\">1922 paper</a>, William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas documented 150 cases of multiple discovery in science and technology. Robert Merton <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/985546\">found 261 examples in 1961</a>, and observed that the phenomenon of multiple discovery was itself a multiple discovery, having been described over and over again since at least the early 19th century.</p><p>But exactly how common is multiple invention? The frequency of examples suggests that it can&#8217;t be particularly rare, but that doesn&#8217;t tell us the rate at which it occurs. In &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/hwscc9mi/release/3\">How Common is Independent Discovery?</a>,&#8221; Matt Clancy catalogues several attempts to estimate the frequency of multiple discovery, and tentatively comes up with a frequency of around 2-3% for simultaneous scientific discoveries, and perhaps an 8% chance that a given invention will be reinvented in the next decade. But the evidence for inventions is somewhat inconsistent, and varies greatly between studies. Clancy estimates a reinvention rate of around 8% per decade, but <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20180017\">another study</a> he found that looked at patent interference lawsuits between 1998 and 2014 suggests an independent invention rate of only around 0.02% per year.</p><p>The frequency of multiple invention is a useful thing to know, because it can give us clues about the nature of technological progress. A very low rate of multiple invention suggests that progress might be driven by a small number of &#8220;genius&#8221; inventors (what we might call the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory\">Great Man Theory</a> of technological progress), and that it might be highly historically contingent (if you re-rolled the dice of history, maybe you get a totally new set of inventions and a different technological palette). A high rate of multiple invention suggests that progress is more a function of broad historical forces (that inventions appear when the conditions are right), and that progress is less contingent (if you re-rolled the dice of history, you&#8217;d get a similar progression of inventions). And if the rate of multiple invention is changing over time, perhaps the nature of technological progress is changing as well.</p><p>I wanted to create my own estimate of the rate of multiple invention, so I started with Wikipedia&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_historic_inventions\">Timeline of historic inventions</a>, which lists \"nonincremental inventions that are widely recognized by reliable sources as having had a direct impact on the course of history that was profound, global, and enduring.&#8221; I narrowed this list down to inventions between 1800 and 1970, both to trim the list to a manageable number, and to restrict it to inventions where I could expect a decent amount of available documentation (earlier efforts may have more gaps in the history, and more recent efforts may not have had time to get the historian&#8217;s treatment). This yielded a list of around 190 inventions. For each one, I looked to see whether the invention had multiple inventors.</p><p>This required specifying what exactly we mean by &#8220;multiple.&#8221; I ended up using three different categories of multiple invention.</p><p>First, there may be multiple <em>descriptions </em>of the same basic idea. When Bell Labs went to file a patent for the transistor in 1948, it was discovered that physicist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Edgar_Lilienfeld\">Julius Lillienfeld</a> had filed a patent for a similar idea in 1926. Lillienfeld likely never actually built his transistor (it would have almost certainly been impossible to build a working one due to material limitations), but he nevertheless described the concept. Similarly, concepts for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#History\">airships</a> were described many years before a working one was built. I counted these descriptions as multiple inventions only if the description included a basic functional mechanism that could have plausibly worked: So Lillienfeld&#8217;s patent counts as a multiple invention, but someone idly stating that &#8220;it would be great if there was a solid state amplifier&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t. (In general, I don&#8217;t consider a previous description as meaningful in a &#8220;who invented X?&#8221; sense &#8212; I don&#8217;t think Lillienfeld should be credited alongside Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain as a co-inventor of the transistor &#8212; but I think it&#8217;s relevant if you&#8217;re trying to understand whether someone else would have invented something if the original inventor didn&#8217;t, so I&#8217;ve included descriptions in this exercise.)</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png\" width=\"352\" height=\"528\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:512,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:352,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fzw9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd49c8dd-af5f-4abd-bc52-50a06a56726b_512x768.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Airship concept sketched by Francesco Lana de Terzi in 1670, via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airship#History\">Wikipedia</a>.

With the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia, multiple development efforts attempted to create an ammonia synthesis process using high-pressure and metal catalysts, though only Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch were actually successful. Similarly, there were numerous attempts to build an incandescent light bulb prior to Edison, which often worked but were impractical. As with multiple descriptions, I counted these as multiple inventions only if the efforts were based on some concept that could have plausibly worked. So <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Ostwald\">Ostwald&#8217;s</a> ammonia synthesis efforts based on using high pressure and metal catalysts count as a multiple because the concept was in the correct ballpark, even though he ultimately failed. Someone trying to transmute lead into ammonia using alchemy wouldn&#8217;t have counted.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png\" width=\"451\" height=\"573.0435458786936\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:817,&quot;width&quot;:643,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:451,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mnI7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdd510d01-b60e-447b-8b35-fa60d8b2a3cc_643x817.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Attempts to create a practical incandescent lightbulb, via <a href=\"https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/9819/edisons-electric-light\">Friedel</a>.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The third category of multiple invention is if there were <em>multiple successes or near-successes</em>: inventions that actually work, or come close. These are things like Whittle and von Ohain&#8217;s jet engines (which first ran in <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/whittle-w1x-turbojet-engine/nasm_A19500082000\">1939</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinkel_HeS_3\">1938</a>, respectively), Edison and Swan&#8217;s lightbulbs, and Kilby and Noyce&#8217;s integrated circuits.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t always straightforward to categorize multiple development efforts. Elisha Gray&#8217;s <a href=\"https://commons.princeton.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/70/2019/08/scientificamerican0181-156-hounshell.pdf\">telephone efforts</a>, for instance seem like they could be plausibly described as either a &#8220;serious development effort&#8221; or a &#8220;previous description&#8221;. And in some cases, it wasn&#8217;t obvious whether something should count as any sort of multiple. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Vladimirovich_Petrov\">Vasily Petrov</a> discovered the electric arc prior to Humphry Davy, but didn&#8217;t appear to try to make an actual lamp out of it. These and other cases were ultimately judgment calls.</p><p>Besides the <em>type</em> of multiple invention, another important consideration was determining whether efforts are &#8220;independent&#8221; or not. If multiple efforts are really just many people copying one person&#8217;s work, then conceivably an invention might not have happened if that first person didn&#8217;t put in the work, even though many people ultimately worked on it. Both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goodyear\">Charles Goodyear</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hancock_(inventor)\">Thomas Hancock</a> developed processes for vulcanizing rubber, but Hancock apparently only began working on his process after getting and reverse-engineering a sample of Goodyear&#8217;s rubber. Similarly, both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Appert\">Nicolas Appert</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Durand\">Peter Durand</a> developed food-preservation methods, but Durand apparently just <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1179/tns.1965.011\">patented Appert&#8217;s process in England</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not straightforward to determine whether multiple invention efforts were independent. In some cases, we can be fairly confident that efforts were independent, such as the transistor, where the earlier effort was only uncovered much later. But in many cases it&#8217;s hard to be sure. For instance, Edison has been accused of stealing the work of Louis Le Prince for his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetoscope\">early motion picture camera</a>, and then <a href=\"https://lithub.com/did-thomas-edison-disappear-his-most-significant-rival-in-inventing-the-kinetograph/\">having him killed</a> (!) to cover it up, but it&#8217;s not clear if this actually happened or if it's just a wild conspiracy theory. Similarly, it&#8217;s been suggested that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_von_Siemens\">Werner von Siemens</a> got the concept for an electric tram from Russian inventor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Pirotsky\">Fyodor Pirotsky</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.research.unipd.it/bitstream/11577/3340486/1/TramElettrici.pdf\">apparently all we really know</a> is that Siemens&#8217; had access to a publication that featured Pirotsky&#8217;s work. I also didn&#8217;t want to be too strict, and exclude a multiple invention merely because the inventor <em>may</em> have been aware of other efforts.</p><p>I&#8217;ve made my best effort to suss out the relationships at work with multiple inventions, and to exclude what seemed like purely derivative efforts, but I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t gotten this 100% correct. If the literature asserts that multiple efforts were independent, I&#8217;ve generally trusted that without investigating too deeply.</p><p>(The full list of inventions and how I classified them is <a href=\"https://github.com/briancpotter/multipleinvention\">available on Github here</a>.)</p><h4>How frequent is multiple invention?</h4><p>Overall, I found that within this sample of historic inventions, multiple invention was extremely common. Out of the 190 inventions I looked at, 105 of them had some type of multiple effort. In 72 cases, these were multiple successes or near successes.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lI4gv/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5d504ea7-b160-4f7a-92b0-64bb9bc8b4d3_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How Often Do Inventions Have Multiple Inventors?&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Fraction of historic inventions between 1800 and 1970 that had multiple inventors.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lI4gv/1/\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p>A few lesser-known examples of multiple invention:</p><ul><li><p>There were many attempts to <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8673849\">build an electric telegraph</a>: &#8220;An early electrical telegraph based on Volta&#8217;s cell was proposed by Catalan physician and experimenter Francisco Salv&#225; Campillo in 1804&#8230; Similar results were obtained five years later by the electrochemical telegraph developed by the German scientist Samuel Thomas von S&#246;mmerring and the English scientist Francis Ronalds in 1816.&#8221; Samuel Morse&#8217;s efforts, <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/collections/samuel-morse-papers/articles-and-essays/invention-of-the-telegraph/\">which began in 1832</a>, seem to have been undertaken without knowledge of these previous efforts.</p></li><li><p>Cyrus McCormick&#8217;s mechanical reaper was preceded in the US by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obed_Hussey\">Obed Hussey&#8217;s</a>, and in England by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Bell\">Patrick Bell&#8217;s</a>.

The rate of multiple successes or near-successes may have declined in the 20th century compared to the 19th, but there&#8217;s enough decade to decade variation that it's hard to be sure.</p><p>We can also look at whether the frequency of multiple invention varies by the type of invention. I classified inventions into six different categories, based on the type of problem that had to be solved to create the invention.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Electrical inventions</strong> - Like the telephone, the lightbulb, and electric motors or generators.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chemical inventions</strong> - New chemicals (such as mauve dye), materials (stainless steel), and new processes for producing existing chemicals or materials (the Bessemer process, the Haber-Bosch process).</p></li><li><p><strong>Mechanical inventions</strong> - New types of machines such as the steam hammer, the rock drill, and various types of aircraft.</p></li><li><p><strong>Electronic inventions</strong> - Things like vacuum tubes, cathode-ray tube-based television, and digital computers. I also put software inventions (like packet-switched networks) into this category.</p></li><li><p><strong>Medical inventions</strong> - New medicines (morphine), medical procedures (using hypodermic needles), or inventions to solve health-related problems (Pasteurization).</p></li><li><p><strong>Other</strong> - Inventions that didn&#8217;t fit into other categories. Often these were discoveries of new important physical phenomena (the photovoltaic effect, electrical induction, X-rays) that Wikipedia included on the list of historic inventions.</p></li></ul><p>In a few cases, I put an invention into multiple categories if it seemed like it fit in both. If an engine seemed like it required solving both mechanical problems (building the engine) and chemical problems (experimenting with fuels), I classified it as both mechanical and chemical. Vapor compression-based ice machines were similarly categorized as both mechanical and chemical.</p><p>The graph below shows the frequency of multiple invention by category.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t1eU9/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63805e11-91f5-44dd-9640-5c5cb06ede7c_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rate of Multiple Invention by Type of Invention&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;For historic inventions between 1800 and 1970.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t1eU9/1/\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p>Frequency of multiples seems relatively constant across categories. There&#8217;s variation between categories, but not necessarily more than I&#8217;d expect from random chance given the relatively small sample sizes. Successes or near successes show especially little variation.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>It was always clear that multiple invention wasn&#8217;t that uncommon, given the number of well-known multiples. But I was still surprised that over 50% of inventions in the time period looked at had some type of multiple effort to create, and that nearly 40% weren&#8217;t simply someone having the idea or working on the problem, but successes or near-successes. I was also surprised that this ratio didn&#8217;t vary much across time and across categories of invention.</p><p>My main takeaway is that the ideas behind inventions are often in some sense &#8220;obvious,&#8221; or at least not so surprising or unexpected that many people won&#8217;t think of them. In some cases, this is probably because once some new possibility comes along, lots of people think of similar things that could be done with it. Once the properties of electricity began to be understood, many people came up with the idea of using it to send signals (telephone, telegraph), or to create motion (engines and generators), or to generate light (arc lamps, incandescent lights). Once the steam engine came along, lots of people had the idea to use it to power various types of vehicles.</p><p>In other cases, multiple invention probably occurs because important problems will attract many people trying to solve them. Steel corrosion was a large problem inspiring many folks to look for ways to create a steel that didn&#8217;t rust, or notice the potential value if they stumbled across such a material. Lamps causing mine fires were a major problem, inspiring many people to come up with ideas for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_lamp\">safety lamps</a>. The smoke produced by gunpowder was a major problem, inspiring many efforts to develop <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder\">smokeless powders</a>. And because would-be inventors will all draw from the same pool of available technologies, materials, and capabilities when coming up with a solution, there will be a large degree of convergence in the solutions they come up with.</p><p>It&#8217;s also notable that this rate of multiple invention is much higher than any of the rates in Matt Clancy&#8217;s &#8220;How common is independent discovery?&#8221; piece. I suspect part of the answer here is that we narrowed our focus to only the most important inventions, which are presumably solving important problems that are much more likely to attract inventors. Clancy notes that previous studies on multiple discovery have found that problems recognized to be important tend to have greater rates of multiple discovery (though it&#8217;s hard to say by how much). It would be interesting to examine a sample of less-prominent inventions to see the rate of independent invention, but I think this would be hard: the inventions where there&#8217;s enough documentation on the various attempts at them are likely the most important ones. The inventions of lesser importance mostly don&#8217;t get written about at all.</p><p>One final thing to note: Clancy notes that a potential point of fragility in scientific or technological progress is in ideas or inventions that are only recognized as important after the fact. These will have fewer people working on them, and thus (presumably) a lower rate of multiple inventions and a greater chance that they get &#8220;missed&#8221;. The above analysis suggests that this <em>may</em> not be much of a risk; because it uses a list of &#8220;historically significant&#8221; inventions, it includes both inventions that were recognized as important at the time (the safety lamp) and ones that were only recognized as important later (electrical induction). Even including both types of invention, the rate of multiples remains very high. (To be more than weak evidence though, we would have to divide the list into inventions that were recognized as important prior to them being invented and ones that weren&#8217;t, and look at the rates of multiple inventions for each. But this seems like a very difficult categorization task.)</p><p><em>Thanks to Matt Clancy for reading a draft of this. All errors are my own.</em></p>",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nPatent sketches of Gray’s (top) and Bell’s (bottom) telephones, via Hounshell.\nWhen Alexander Graham Bell filed a patent for the telephone on February 14th, 1876, he beat competing telephone developer Elisha Gray to the patent office by just a few hours. The resulting legal dispute between Bell Telephone and Western Union (which owned the rights to Gray’s invention) would consume millions of dollars before being resolved in Bell’s favor in 1879.\nSuch cases of multiple invention are common, and some of the most famous and important modern inventions were invented in parallel. Both Thomas Edison and Joseph Swan patented incandescent lightbulbs in 1880. Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce patented integrated circuits in 1959. Hans von Ohain and Frank Whittle independently invented the jet engine in the 1930s. In a 1922 paper, William Ogburn and Dorothy Thomas documented 150 cases of multiple discovery in science and technology. Robert Merton found 261 examples in 1961, and observed that the phenomenon of multiple discovery was itself a multiple discovery, having been described over and over again since at least the early 19th century.\nBut exactly how common is multiple invention? The frequency of examples suggests that it can’t be particularly rare, but that doesn’t tell us the rate at which it occurs. In “ How Common is Independent Discovery?,” Matt Clancy catalogues several attempts to estimate the frequency of multiple discovery, and tentatively comes up with a frequency of around 2-3% for simultaneous scientific discoveries, and perhaps an 8% chance that a given invention will be reinvented in the next decade. But the evidence for inventions is somewhat inconsistent, and varies greatly between studies. Clancy estimates a reinvention rate of around 8% per decade, but another study he found that looked at patent interference lawsuits between 1998 and 2014 suggests an independent invention rate of only around 0.02% per year.\nThe frequency of multiple invention is a useful thing to know, because it can give us clues about the nature of technological progress. A very low rate of multiple invention suggests that progress might be driven by a small number of “genius” inventors (what we might call the Great Man Theory of technological progress), and that it might be highly historically contingent (if you re-rolled the dice of history, maybe you get a totally new set of inventions and a different technological palette). A high rate of multiple invention suggests that progress is more a function of broad historical forces (that inventions appear when the conditions are right), and that progress is less contingent (if you re-rolled the dice of history, you’d get a similar progression of inventions). And if the rate of multiple invention is changing over time, perhaps the nature of technological progress is changing as well.\nI wanted to create my own estimate of the rate of multiple invention, so I started with Wikipedia’s Timeline of historic inventions, which lists \"nonincremental inventions that are widely recognized by reliable sources as having had a direct impact on the course of history that was profound, global, and enduring.” I narrowed this list down to inventions between 1800 and 1970, both to trim the list to a manageable number, and to restrict it to inventions where I could expect a decent amount of available documentation (earlier efforts may have more gaps in the history, and more recent efforts may not have had time to get the historian’s treatment). This yielded a list of around 190 inventions. For each one, I looked to see whether the invention had multiple inventors.\nThis required specifying what exactly we mean by “multiple.” I ended up using three different categories of multiple invention.\nFirst, there may be multiple descriptions of the same basic idea. When Bell Labs went to file a patent for the transistor in 1948, it was discovered that physicist Julius Lillienfeld had filed a patent for a similar idea in 1926. Lillienfeld likely never actually built his transistor (it would have almost certainly been impossible to build a working one due to material limitations), but he nevertheless described the concept. Similarly, concepts for airships were described many years before a working one was built. I counted these descriptions as multiple inventions only if the description included a basic functional mechanism that could have plausibly worked: So Lillienfeld’s patent counts as a multiple invention, but someone idly stating that “it would be great if there was a solid state amplifier” wouldn’t. (In general, I don’t consider a previous description as meaningful in a “who invented X?” sense — I don’t think Lillienfeld should be credited alongside Shockley, Bardeen and Brattain as a co-inventor of the transistor — but I think it’s relevant if you’re trying to understand whether someone else would have invented something if the original inventor didn’t, so I’ve included descriptions in this exercise.)\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nAirship concept sketched by Francesco Lana de Terzi in 1670, via Wikipedia. Lift is provided by 4 hollow spheres that have had the air removed to create a vacuum.\nThe second category of multiple invention I used was cases where there were multiple serious efforts to actually create a given invention. With the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia, multiple development efforts attempted to create an ammonia synthesis process using high-pressure and metal catalysts, though only Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch were actually successful. Similarly, there were numerous attempts to build an incandescent light bulb prior to Edison, which often worked but were impractical. As with multiple descriptions, I counted these as multiple inventions only if the efforts were based on some concept that could have plausibly worked. So Ostwald’s ammonia synthesis efforts based on using high pressure and metal catalysts count as a multiple because the concept was in the correct ballpark, even though he ultimately failed. Someone trying to transmute lead into ammonia using alchemy wouldn’t have counted.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nAttempts to create a practical incandescent lightbulb, via Friedel.\nThe third category of multiple invention is if there were multiple successes or near-successes: inventions that actually work, or come close. These are things like Whittle and von Ohain’s jet engines (which first ran in 1939 and 1938, respectively), Edison and Swan’s lightbulbs, and Kilby and Noyce’s integrated circuits.\nIt wasn’t always straightforward to categorize multiple development efforts. Elisha Gray’s telephone efforts, for instance seem like they could be plausibly described as either a “serious development effort” or a “previous description”. And in some cases, it wasn’t obvious whether something should count as any sort of multiple. Vasily Petrov discovered the electric arc prior to Humphry Davy, but didn’t appear to try to make an actual lamp out of it. These and other cases were ultimately judgment calls.\nBesides the type of multiple invention, another important consideration was determining whether efforts are “independent” or not. If multiple efforts are really just many people copying one person’s work, then conceivably an invention might not have happened if that first person didn’t put in the work, even though many people ultimately worked on it. Both Charles Goodyear and Thomas Hancock developed processes for vulcanizing rubber, but Hancock apparently only began working on his process after getting and reverse-engineering a sample of Goodyear’s rubber. Similarly, both Nicolas Appert and Peter Durand developed food-preservation methods, but Durand apparently just patented Appert’s process in England.\nUnfortunately, it’s not straightforward to determine whether multiple invention efforts were independent. In some cases, we can be fairly confident that efforts were independent, such as the transistor, where the earlier effort was only uncovered much later. But in many cases it’s hard to be sure. For instance, Edison has been accused of stealing the work of Louis Le Prince for his early motion picture camera, and then having him killed(!) to cover it up, but it’s not clear if this actually happened or if it's just a wild conspiracy theory. Similarly, it’s been suggested that Werner von Siemens got the concept for an electric tram from Russian inventor Fyodor Pirotsky, but apparently all we really know is that Siemens’ had access to a publication that featured Pirotsky’s work. I also didn’t want to be too strict, and exclude a multiple invention merely because the inventor may have been aware of other efforts.\nI’ve made my best effort to suss out the relationships at work with multiple inventions, and to exclude what seemed like purely derivative efforts, but I’m sure I haven’t gotten this 100% correct. If the literature asserts that multiple efforts were independent, I’ve generally trusted that without investigating too deeply.\n(The full list of inventions and how I classified them is available on Github here.)\nHow frequent is multiple invention?\nOverall, I found that within this sample of historic inventions, multiple invention was extremely common. Out of the 190 inventions I looked at, 105 of them had some type of multiple effort. In 72 cases, these were multiple successes or near successes.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nA few lesser-known examples of multiple invention:\n\nThere were many attempts to build an electric telegraph: “An early electrical telegraph based on Volta’s cell was proposed by Catalan physician and experimenter Francisco Salvá Campillo in 1804… Similar results were obtained five years later by the electrochemical telegraph developed by the German scientist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring and the English scientist Francis Ronalds in 1816.” Samuel Morse’s efforts, which began in 1832, seem to have been undertaken without knowledge of these previous efforts.\n\nCyrus McCormick’s mechanical reaper was preceded in the US by Obed Hussey’s, and in England by Patrick Bell’s. Between 1786 and 1831 (when McCormick first operated his reaper), there were more than 30 attempts to build a mechanical reaping machine in England and Scotland.\n\nMethods for taking photographs were developed by both Louis Daguerre(whose work was based on that of Nicéphore Niépce) and Henry Talbot.\n\nStainless steel was discovered by “seven men, unknown to each other and living in four different countries.”\n\nCharles Parsons is often credited with the invention of the steam turbine in 1884, but Carl Gustav Patrick De Laval invented a different type of steam turbine in 1882, and the concept of a steam turbine had been described for hundreds of years prior.\n\nThe electron microscope was independently invented by a team at TU Berlin in 1931 and Reinhold Rüdenberg in 1932.\nWe can also look at whether the rate of multiple invention has changed over time. The graph below shows the fraction of historic inventions each decade that had multiple, plausibly independent efforts.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nWhile the graph is noisy, it doesn’t appear that the rate of multiple invention changed much between 1800 and 1970. The rate of multiple successes or near-successes may have declined in the 20th century compared to the 19th, but there’s enough decade to decade variation that it's hard to be sure.\nWe can also look at whether the frequency of multiple invention varies by the type of invention. I classified inventions into six different categories, based on the type of problem that had to be solved to create the invention.\n\nElectrical inventions- Like the telephone, the lightbulb, and electric motors or generators.\n\nChemical inventions- New chemicals (such as mauve dye), materials (stainless steel), and new processes for producing existing chemicals or materials (the Bessemer process, the Haber-Bosch process).\n\nMechanical inventions- New types of machines such as the steam hammer, the rock drill, and various types of aircraft.\n\nElectronic inventions- Things like vacuum tubes, cathode-ray tube-based television, and digital computers. I also put software inventions (like packet-switched networks) into this category.\n\nMedical inventions- New medicines (morphine), medical procedures (using hypodermic needles), or inventions to solve health-related problems (Pasteurization).\n\nOther- Inventions that didn’t fit into other categories. Often these were discoveries of new important physical phenomena (the photovoltaic effect, electrical induction, X-rays) that Wikipedia included on the list of historic inventions.\nIn a few cases, I put an invention into multiple categories if it seemed like it fit in both. If an engine seemed like it required solving both mechanical problems (building the engine) and chemical problems (experimenting with fuels), I classified it as both mechanical and chemical. Vapor compression-based ice machines were similarly categorized as both mechanical and chemical.\nThe graph below shows the frequency of multiple invention by category.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nFrequency of multiples seems relatively constant across categories. There’s variation between categories, but not necessarily more than I’d expect from random chance given the relatively small sample sizes. Successes or near successes show especially little variation.\nConclusion\nIt was always clear that multiple invention wasn’t that uncommon, given the number of well-known multiples. But I was still surprised that over 50% of inventions in the time period looked at had some type of multiple effort to create, and that nearly 40% weren’t simply someone having the idea or working on the problem, but successes or near-successes. I was also surprised that this ratio didn’t vary much across time and across categories of invention.\nMy main takeaway is that the ideas behind inventions are often in some sense “obvious,” or at least not so surprising or unexpected that many people won’t think of them. In some cases, this is probably because once some new possibility comes along, lots of people think of similar things that could be done with it. Once the properties of electricity began to be understood, many people came up with the idea of using it to send signals (telephone, telegraph), or to create motion (engines and generators), or to generate light (arc lamps, incandescent lights). Once the steam engine came along, lots of people had the idea to use it to power various types of vehicles.\nIn other cases, multiple invention probably occurs because important problems will attract many people trying to solve them. Steel corrosion was a large problem inspiring many folks to look for ways to create a steel that didn’t rust, or notice the potential value if they stumbled across such a material. Lamps causing mine fires were a major problem, inspiring many people to come up with ideas for safety lamps. The smoke produced by gunpowder was a major problem, inspiring many efforts to develop smokeless powders. And because would-be inventors will all draw from the same pool of available technologies, materials, and capabilities when coming up with a solution, there will be a large degree of convergence in the solutions they come up with.\nIt’s also notable that this rate of multiple invention is much higher than any of the rates in Matt Clancy’s “How common is independent discovery?” piece. I suspect part of the answer here is that we narrowed our focus to only the most important inventions, which are presumably solving important problems that are much more likely to attract inventors. Clancy notes that previous studies on multiple discovery have found that problems recognized to be important tend to have greater rates of multiple discovery (though it’s hard to say by how much). It would be interesting to examine a sample of less-prominent inventions to see the rate of independent invention, but I think this would be hard: the inventions where there’s enough documentation on the various attempts at them are likely the most important ones. The inventions of lesser importance mostly don’t get written about at all.\nOne final thing to note: Clancy notes that a potential point of fragility in scientific or technological progress is in ideas or inventions that are only recognized as important after the fact. These will have fewer people working on them, and thus (presumably) a lower rate of multiple inventions and a greater chance that they get “missed”. The above analysis suggests that this may not be much of a risk; because it uses a list of “historically significant” inventions, it includes both inventions that were recognized as important at the time (the safety lamp) and ones that were only recognized as important later (electrical induction). Even including both types of invention, the rate of multiples remains very high. (To be more than weak evidence though, we would have to divide the list into inventions that were recognized as important prior to them being invented and ones that weren’t, and look at the rates of multiple inventions for each. But this seems like a very difficult categorization task.)\nThanks to Matt Clancy for reading a draft of this. All errors are my own.",

This week we look at wind wars, radiation limits, US power plant water use, grassroots opposition to data centers, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><p>A few housekeeping items this week:</p><ul><li><p>Last week I tried out a new reading list format of more items with shorter descriptions of each. People largely seemed to prefer the old format, so I&#8217;ll continue to stick with that.</p></li><li><p>Some folks pointed out that the simplified energy analysis used in <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/can-we-afford-large-scale-solar-pv\">Can We Afford Large-scale Solar PV?</a> misses some important factors that can affect the cost of large-scale solar PV deployment. For instance, my analysis used fairly simple energy accounting (how much capacity do we need to meet demand at any given time), but utilities have stricter requirements, based on concepts like <a href=\"https://stanwichenergy.com/insights/understanding-effective-load-carrying-capability-elcc-how-renewable-reliability-impacts-costs-for-energy-users\">Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC)</a>, which calculate how much additional capacity a resource can serve while maintaining a given level of reliability, and which may drive up the requirements for firm sources like gas turbines. I&#8217;m working on a more complex analysis that takes this and other factors into account.</p></li></ul><h5>Wind wars</h5><p>Wind turbines generate power by extracting energy from moving air, and transforming it into electricity. This extraction means that wind slows down after it passes through a turbine (by around <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602253113\">40-50%</a>), and that a turbine can cast a wind shadow on turbines downwind of it, reducing how much power they generate. In some places, such as the North Sea, these <a href=\"https://businessnorway.com/articles/wake-effects-and-how-they-impact-wind-turbine-performance\">wake effects</a> have resulted in wind farm owners accusing each other of &#8220;wind theft&#8221;. Via the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250506-renewable-energys-trouble-with-wind-theft\">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>From an investment perspective, even relatively small wake effects can cause problems for offshore developers, Finser&#229;s says. \"There are huge costs to building an offshore wind farm,\" he explains, due to the sheer scale of these farms as well as all the complex related work, including deploying special-purpose vessels. To justify their investment and make a profit, \"it's very important for a developer to be able to project that the wind farm will produce a given amount of electricity for 25 or 30 years\", the typical lifespan of a wind farm, he says. Even a relatively small, unexpected reduction in that energy output can upset this investment calculation and make the wind farm not financially viable, Finser&#229;s says.</em></p><p><em>If operators or countries try to avoid these wake effects by securing the best spots for themselves, it can create another risk, he warns: wake effects may cause what's known as \"the 'race to the water' phenomenon, whereby states rush development in order to reap benefits from the best-yet available wind resources\". Rushing development could then increase the risk of ignoring other important aspects of wind farm planning, such as protecting the marine environment, he says.</em></p></blockquote><h5>ALARA reconsidered?</h5><p>Nuclear power enthusiasts often note that nuclear power is unreasonably harmed by a policy of <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/alara.html\">ALARA</a>: that radiation exposure should be &#8220;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&#8221;. In practice, this means that safety requirements constantly ratchet upward, driving up the costs of nuclear safety systems and making nuclear power uneconomic. ALARA, in turn, is based on a &#8220;Linear No Threshold&#8221; model of radiation damage (roughly, that risk from radiation increases linearly with dose, and there&#8217;s no dose that&#8217;s &#8220;safe&#8221; other than zero) which many experts feel is inaccurate.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\">Trump executive order</a> aimed at boosting nuclear power requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reconsider its use of the Linear No Threshold model. <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-bad-science-behind-expensive-nuclear/\">A recent piece on Works in Progress</a> looks at the executive order, and the history of Linear No Threshold:</p><blockquote><p><em>In 2013, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between General Electric and Hitachi, applied to build three advanced boiling water reactors in Wales. Fission reactions would boil water into steam, turning a turbine, powering a generator, and producing electricity. This specific design had been employed in four Japanese reactors, which had survived earthquakes of a greater magnitude than have ever hit the UK without posing any threat to workers or the public.</em></p><p><em>Even though the reactor had a flawless safety record, the UK&#8217;s Office for Nuclear Regulation was not satisfied. Over the course of a four and a half year process, it demanded a series of design changes. These included the installation of expensive, bulky filters on every heating, ventilation, and air conditioning duct in the reactor and turbine building, a new floorplan for the room in the plant&#8217;s facility that housed the filtration systems, and an entirely new layout for the facility&#8217;s ventilation ducts. This was justified on two grounds. First, it would optimise the ventilation system for accidents, despite the fact that the reactor design already had an entirely separate safety system, with redundancy built in, for this exact purpose. Second, it would cut radiation exposure during routine operation. As GE-Hitachi pointed out, this reduction amounted to 0.0001 millisieverts per year &#8211; the amount a human ingests when they consume a banana.</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m optimistic about the potential for making nuclear cheaper by revisiting some of the safety assumptions that drive its expense, but as we <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-051725\">noted a couple weeks ago</a>, congress&#8217; dismantling of the Loan Programs Office is very likely to hamstring any potential future US nuclear deployment.</p><h5>BYD price reduction</h5><p>Chinese cars are already gaining <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/29/business/china-cars-sales-exports.html\">marketshare around the world</a> thanks to their low cost and (apparently) surprisingly high quality. Now carmaker BYD is upping the ante by cutting prices even more, which it can do thanks to its vertical integration and resulting high margins. Its bestselling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Seagull\">Seagull EV</a> now costs less than $8000, down from <a href=\"https://licarco.com/byd-seagull#:~:text=It%20officially%20launched%20in%20April,costs%2073%2C800%20CNY%20(%2410%2C700).\">$10,700 in 2023</a>, and some models have been reduced in price by more than 30%. Via the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03411eb1-ace8-44fa-b062-c6dced602ea5?\">Financial Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>These price cuts come as the EV industry enters a new phase. While total sales remain high, growth is slowing. In China, dealerships held 3.5mn unsold EVs as of April, the highest level since December 2023.</em></p><p><em>Most carmakers would respond cautiously to a slowdown, cutting production and incentives. The reason BYD can afford to take the offensive is its unique cost structure rooted in vertical integration. It makes its own batteries, designs its chips and tightly controls operations.</em></p><p><em>That cost advantage means that when rivals cut prices, it is at the expense of fragile margins.

Via@sci_fi_infra.\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology. This week we look at wind wars, radiation limits, US power plant water use, grassroots opposition to data centers, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nA few housekeeping items this week:\n\nLast week I tried out a new reading list format of more items with shorter descriptions of each. People largely seemed to prefer the old format, so I’ll continue to stick with that.\n\nSome folks pointed out that the simplified energy analysis used in Can We Afford Large-scale Solar PV? misses some important factors that can affect the cost of large-scale solar PV deployment. For instance, my analysis used fairly simple energy accounting (how much capacity do we need to meet demand at any given time), but utilities have stricter requirements, based on concepts like Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC), which calculate how much additional capacity a resource can serve while maintaining a given level of reliability, and which may drive up the requirements for firm sources like gas turbines. I’m working on a more complex analysis that takes this and other factors into account.\nWind wars\nWind turbines generate power by extracting energy from moving air, and transforming it into electricity. This extraction means that wind slows down after it passes through a turbine (by around 40-50%), and that a turbine can cast a wind shadow on turbines downwind of it, reducing how much power they generate. In some places, such as the North Sea, these wake effects have resulted in wind farm owners accusing each other of “wind theft”. Via the BBC:\n\nFrom an investment perspective, even relatively small wake effects can cause problems for offshore developers, Finserås says. \"There are huge costs to building an offshore wind farm,\" he explains, due to the sheer scale of these farms as well as all the complex related work, including deploying special-purpose vessels. To justify their investment and make a profit, \"it's very important for a developer to be able to project that the wind farm will produce a given amount of electricity for 25 or 30 years\", the typical lifespan of a wind farm, he says. Even a relatively small, unexpected reduction in that energy output can upset this investment calculation and make the wind farm not financially viable, Finserås says.\nIf operators or countries try to avoid these wake effects by securing the best spots for themselves, it can create another risk, he warns: wake effects may cause what's known as \"the 'race to the water' phenomenon, whereby states rush development in order to reap benefits from the best-yet available wind resources\". Rushing development could then increase the risk of ignoring other important aspects of wind farm planning, such as protecting the marine environment, he says.\nALARA reconsidered?\nNuclear power enthusiasts often note that nuclear power is unreasonably harmed by a policy of ALARA: that radiation exposure should be “As Low As Reasonably Achievable”. In practice, this means that safety requirements constantly ratchet upward, driving up the costs of nuclear safety systems and making nuclear power uneconomic. ALARA, in turn, is based on a “Linear No Threshold” model of radiation damage (roughly, that risk from radiation increases linearly with dose, and there’s no dose that’s “safe” other than zero) which many experts feel is inaccurate.\nA recent Trump executive order aimed at boosting nuclear power requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reconsider its use of the Linear No Threshold model. A recent piece on Works in Progress looks at the executive order, and the history of Linear No Threshold:\n\nIn 2013, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between General Electric and Hitachi, applied to build three advanced boiling water reactors in Wales. Fission reactions would boil water into steam, turning a turbine, powering a generator, and producing electricity. This specific design had been employed in four Japanese reactors, which had survived earthquakes of a greater magnitude than have ever hit the UK without posing any threat to workers or the public.\nEven though the reactor had a flawless safety record, the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation was not satisfied. Over the course of a four and a half year process, it demanded a series of design changes. These included the installation of expensive, bulky filters on every heating, ventilation, and air conditioning duct in the reactor and turbine building, a new floorplan for the room in the plant’s facility that housed the filtration systems, and an entirely new layout for the facility’s ventilation ducts. This was justified on two grounds. First, it would optimise the ventilation system for accidents, despite the fact that the reactor design already had an entirely separate safety system, with redundancy built in, for this exact purpose. Second, it would cut radiation exposure during routine operation. As GE-Hitachi pointed out, this reduction amounted to 0.0001 millisieverts per year – the amount a human ingests when they consume a banana.\nI’m optimistic about the potential for making nuclear cheaper by revisiting some of the safety assumptions that drive its expense, but as we noted a couple weeks ago, congress’ dismantling of the Loan Programs Office is very likely to hamstring any potential future US nuclear deployment.\nBYD price reduction\nChinese cars are already gaining marketshare around the world thanks to their low cost and (apparently) surprisingly high quality. Now carmaker BYD is upping the ante by cutting prices even more, which it can do thanks to its vertical integration and resulting high margins. Its bestselling Seagull EV now costs less than $8000, down from$10,700 in 2023, and some models have been reduced in price by more than 30%. Via the Financial Times:\n\nThese price cuts come as the EV industry enters a new phase. While total sales remain high, growth is slowing. In China, dealerships held 3.5mn unsold EVs as of April, the highest level since December 2023.\nMost carmakers would respond cautiously to a slowdown, cutting production and incentives. The reason BYD can afford to take the offensive is its unique cost structure rooted in vertical integration. It makes its own batteries, designs its chips and tightly controls operations.\nThat cost advantage means that when rivals cut prices, it is at the expense of fragile margins. When BYD cuts prices, it buys market share and future pricing power. Despite multiple rounds of price cuts in recent years, some as steep as 30 per cent, gross margins have continued to rise since 2021, reflecting its margin buffer.\nIn other BYD news, BYD is now outselling Tesla in Europe. Via the Wall Street Journal:\n\nTesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% from a year earlier, according to data from JATO Dynamics, a consumer-research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.\nGM builds V8 plant\nIn the US, on the other hand, “slowing” EV sales have caused GM to pivot back towards internal combustion: it’s investing nearly a billion dollars in an ICE engine plant, and is planning a new V8 engine model that won’t start production until 2027. Via the Wall Street Journal:\n\nGeneral Motors has abandoned a plan to pump $300 million into electric-vehicle motor production at its upstate New York plant and will instead invest $888 million to make the latest V-8 engines.\nSince the EV announcement two years ago for its Tonawanda plant, electric-vehicle sales have slowed, prompting GM and other carmakers to walk back investment plans for the technology.\nThe company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant…\nIt’s not clear to me what “slowing EV sales” really means here. GM’s quarterly income presentation, Cox automotive, and data from California car dealerships, all suggest GM EV sales are way up. Sandy Munro must be rolling in his (metaphorical) grave.\nRead more",

Via@sci_fi_infra.\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology. This week we look at wind wars, radiation limits, US power plant water use, grassroots opposition to data centers, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nA few housekeeping items this week:\n\nLast week I tried out a new reading list format of more items with shorter descriptions of each. People largely seemed to prefer the old format, so I’ll continue to stick with that.\n\nSome folks pointed out that the simplified energy analysis used in Can We Afford Large-scale Solar PV? misses some important factors that can affect the cost of large-scale solar PV deployment. For instance, my analysis used fairly simple energy accounting (how much capacity do we need to meet demand at any given time), but utilities have stricter requirements, based on concepts like Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC), which calculate how much additional capacity a resource can serve while maintaining a given level of reliability, and which may drive up the requirements for firm sources like gas turbines. I’m working on a more complex analysis that takes this and other factors into account.\nWind wars\nWind turbines generate power by extracting energy from moving air, and transforming it into electricity. This extraction means that wind slows down after it passes through a turbine (by around 40-50%), and that a turbine can cast a wind shadow on turbines downwind of it, reducing how much power they generate. In some places, such as the North Sea, these wake effects have resulted in wind farm owners accusing each other of “wind theft”. Via the BBC:\n\nFrom an investment perspective, even relatively small wake effects can cause problems for offshore developers, Finserås says. \"There are huge costs to building an offshore wind farm,\" he explains, due to the sheer scale of these farms as well as all the complex related work, including deploying special-purpose vessels. To justify their investment and make a profit, \"it's very important for a developer to be able to project that the wind farm will produce a given amount of electricity for 25 or 30 years\", the typical lifespan of a wind farm, he says. Even a relatively small, unexpected reduction in that energy output can upset this investment calculation and make the wind farm not financially viable, Finserås says.\nIf operators or countries try to avoid these wake effects by securing the best spots for themselves, it can create another risk, he warns: wake effects may cause what's known as \"the 'race to the water' phenomenon, whereby states rush development in order to reap benefits from the best-yet available wind resources\". Rushing development could then increase the risk of ignoring other important aspects of wind farm planning, such as protecting the marine environment, he says.\nALARA reconsidered?\nNuclear power enthusiasts often note that nuclear power is unreasonably harmed by a policy of ALARA: that radiation exposure should be “As Low As Reasonably Achievable”. In practice, this means that safety requirements constantly ratchet upward, driving up the costs of nuclear safety systems and making nuclear power uneconomic. ALARA, in turn, is based on a “Linear No Threshold” model of radiation damage (roughly, that risk from radiation increases linearly with dose, and there’s no dose that’s “safe” other than zero) which many experts feel is inaccurate.\nA recent Trump executive order aimed at boosting nuclear power requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reconsider its use of the Linear No Threshold model. A recent piece on Works in Progress looks at the executive order, and the history of Linear No Threshold:\n\nIn 2013, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between General Electric and Hitachi, applied to build three advanced boiling water reactors in Wales. Fission reactions would boil water into steam, turning a turbine, powering a generator, and producing electricity. This specific design had been employed in four Japanese reactors, which had survived earthquakes of a greater magnitude than have ever hit the UK without posing any threat to workers or the public.\nEven though the reactor had a flawless safety record, the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation was not satisfied. Over the course of a four and a half year process, it demanded a series of design changes. These included the installation of expensive, bulky filters on every heating, ventilation, and air conditioning duct in the reactor and turbine building, a new floorplan for the room in the plant’s facility that housed the filtration systems, and an entirely new layout for the facility’s ventilation ducts. This was justified on two grounds. First, it would optimise the ventilation system for accidents, despite the fact that the reactor design already had an entirely separate safety system, with redundancy built in, for this exact purpose. Second, it would cut radiation exposure during routine operation. As GE-Hitachi pointed out, this reduction amounted to 0.0001 millisieverts per year – the amount a human ingests when they consume a banana.\nI’m optimistic about the potential for making nuclear cheaper by revisiting some of the safety assumptions that drive its expense, but as we noted a couple weeks ago, congress’ dismantling of the Loan Programs Office is very likely to hamstring any potential future US nuclear deployment.\nBYD price reduction\nChinese cars are already gaining marketshare around the world thanks to their low cost and (apparently) surprisingly high quality. Now carmaker BYD is upping the ante by cutting prices even more, which it can do thanks to its vertical integration and resulting high margins. Its bestselling Seagull EV now costs less than $8000, down from$10,700 in 2023, and some models have been reduced in price by more than 30%. Via the Financial Times:\n\nThese price cuts come as the EV industry enters a new phase. While total sales remain high, growth is slowing. In China, dealerships held 3.5mn unsold EVs as of April, the highest level since December 2023.\nMost carmakers would respond cautiously to a slowdown, cutting production and incentives. The reason BYD can afford to take the offensive is its unique cost structure rooted in vertical integration. It makes its own batteries, designs its chips and tightly controls operations.\nThat cost advantage means that when rivals cut prices, it is at the expense of fragile margins. When BYD cuts prices, it buys market share and future pricing power. Despite multiple rounds of price cuts in recent years, some as steep as 30 per cent, gross margins have continued to rise since 2021, reflecting its margin buffer.\nIn other BYD news, BYD is now outselling Tesla in Europe. Via the Wall Street Journal:\n\nTesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% from a year earlier, according to data from JATO Dynamics, a consumer-research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.\nGM builds V8 plant\nIn the US, on the other hand, “slowing” EV sales have caused GM to pivot back towards internal combustion: it’s investing nearly a billion dollars in an ICE engine plant, and is planning a new V8 engine model that won’t start production until 2027. Via the Wall Street Journal:\n\nGeneral Motors has abandoned a plan to pump $300 million into electric-vehicle motor production at its upstate New York plant and will instead invest $888 million to make the latest V-8 engines.\nSince the EV announcement two years ago for its Tonawanda plant, electric-vehicle sales have slowed, prompting GM and other carmakers to walk back investment plans for the technology.\nThe company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant…\nIt’s not clear to me what “slowing EV sales” really means here. GM’s quarterly income presentation, Cox automotive, and data from California car dealerships, all suggest GM EV sales are way up. Sandy Munro must be rolling in his (metaphorical) grave.\nRead more",

This week we look at wind wars, radiation limits, US power plant water use, grassroots opposition to data centers, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><p>A few housekeeping items this week:</p><ul><li><p>Last week I tried out a new reading list format of more items with shorter descriptions of each. People largely seemed to prefer the old format, so I&#8217;ll continue to stick with that.</p></li><li><p>Some folks pointed out that the simplified energy analysis used in <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/can-we-afford-large-scale-solar-pv\">Can We Afford Large-scale Solar PV?</a> misses some important factors that can affect the cost of large-scale solar PV deployment. For instance, my analysis used fairly simple energy accounting (how much capacity do we need to meet demand at any given time), but utilities have stricter requirements, based on concepts like <a href=\"https://stanwichenergy.com/insights/understanding-effective-load-carrying-capability-elcc-how-renewable-reliability-impacts-costs-for-energy-users\">Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC)</a>, which calculate how much additional capacity a resource can serve while maintaining a given level of reliability, and which may drive up the requirements for firm sources like gas turbines. I&#8217;m working on a more complex analysis that takes this and other factors into account.</p></li></ul><h5>Wind wars</h5><p>Wind turbines generate power by extracting energy from moving air, and transforming it into electricity. This extraction means that wind slows down after it passes through a turbine (by around <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602253113\">40-50%</a>), and that a turbine can cast a wind shadow on turbines downwind of it, reducing how much power they generate. In some places, such as the North Sea, these <a href=\"https://businessnorway.com/articles/wake-effects-and-how-they-impact-wind-turbine-performance\">wake effects</a> have resulted in wind farm owners accusing each other of &#8220;wind theft&#8221;. Via the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250506-renewable-energys-trouble-with-wind-theft\">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>From an investment perspective, even relatively small wake effects can cause problems for offshore developers, Finser&#229;s says. \"There are huge costs to building an offshore wind farm,\" he explains, due to the sheer scale of these farms as well as all the complex related work, including deploying special-purpose vessels. To justify their investment and make a profit, \"it's very important for a developer to be able to project that the wind farm will produce a given amount of electricity for 25 or 30 years\", the typical lifespan of a wind farm, he says. Even a relatively small, unexpected reduction in that energy output can upset this investment calculation and make the wind farm not financially viable, Finser&#229;s says.</em></p><p><em>If operators or countries try to avoid these wake effects by securing the best spots for themselves, it can create another risk, he warns: wake effects may cause what's known as \"the 'race to the water' phenomenon, whereby states rush development in order to reap benefits from the best-yet available wind resources\". Rushing development could then increase the risk of ignoring other important aspects of wind farm planning, such as protecting the marine environment, he says.</em></p></blockquote><h5>ALARA reconsidered?</h5><p>Nuclear power enthusiasts often note that nuclear power is unreasonably harmed by a policy of <a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary/alara.html\">ALARA</a>: that radiation exposure should be &#8220;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&#8221;. In practice, this means that safety requirements constantly ratchet upward, driving up the costs of nuclear safety systems and making nuclear power uneconomic. ALARA, in turn, is based on a &#8220;Linear No Threshold&#8221; model of radiation damage (roughly, that risk from radiation increases linearly with dose, and there&#8217;s no dose that&#8217;s &#8220;safe&#8221; other than zero) which many experts feel is inaccurate.</p><p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/ordering-the-reform-of-the-nuclear-regulatory-commission/\">Trump executive order</a> aimed at boosting nuclear power requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reconsider its use of the Linear No Threshold model. <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-bad-science-behind-expensive-nuclear/\">A recent piece on Works in Progress</a> looks at the executive order, and the history of Linear No Threshold:</p><blockquote><p><em>In 2013, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, a joint venture between General Electric and Hitachi, applied to build three advanced boiling water reactors in Wales. Fission reactions would boil water into steam, turning a turbine, powering a generator, and producing electricity. This specific design had been employed in four Japanese reactors, which had survived earthquakes of a greater magnitude than have ever hit the UK without posing any threat to workers or the public.</em></p><p><em>Even though the reactor had a flawless safety record, the UK&#8217;s Office for Nuclear Regulation was not satisfied. Over the course of a four and a half year process, it demanded a series of design changes. These included the installation of expensive, bulky filters on every heating, ventilation, and air conditioning duct in the reactor and turbine building, a new floorplan for the room in the plant&#8217;s facility that housed the filtration systems, and an entirely new layout for the facility&#8217;s ventilation ducts. This was justified on two grounds. First, it would optimise the ventilation system for accidents, despite the fact that the reactor design already had an entirely separate safety system, with redundancy built in, for this exact purpose. Second, it would cut radiation exposure during routine operation. As GE-Hitachi pointed out, this reduction amounted to 0.0001 millisieverts per year &#8211; the amount a human ingests when they consume a banana.</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m optimistic about the potential for making nuclear cheaper by revisiting some of the safety assumptions that drive its expense, but as we <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-051725\">noted a couple weeks ago</a>, congress&#8217; dismantling of the Loan Programs Office is very likely to hamstring any potential future US nuclear deployment.</p><h5>BYD price reduction</h5><p>Chinese cars are already gaining <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/29/business/china-cars-sales-exports.html\">marketshare around the world</a> thanks to their low cost and (apparently) surprisingly high quality. Now carmaker BYD is upping the ante by cutting prices even more, which it can do thanks to its vertical integration and resulting high margins. Its bestselling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Seagull\">Seagull EV</a> now costs less than $8000, down from <a href=\"https://licarco.com/byd-seagull#:~:text=It%20officially%20launched%20in%20April,costs%2073%2C800%20CNY%20(%2410%2C700).\">$10,700 in 2023</a>, and some models have been reduced in price by more than 30%. Via the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03411eb1-ace8-44fa-b062-c6dced602ea5?\">Financial Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>These price cuts come as the EV industry enters a new phase. While total sales remain high, growth is slowing. In China, dealerships held 3.5mn unsold EVs as of April, the highest level since December 2023.</em></p><p><em>Most carmakers would respond cautiously to a slowdown, cutting production and incentives. The reason BYD can afford to take the offensive is its unique cost structure rooted in vertical integration. It makes its own batteries, designs its chips and tightly controls operations.</em></p><p><em>That cost advantage means that when rivals cut prices, it is at the expense of fragile margins. When BYD cuts prices, it buys market share and future pricing power. Despite multiple rounds of price cuts in recent years, some as steep as 30 per cent, gross margins have continued to rise since 2021, reflecting its margin buffer.</em></p></blockquote><p>In other BYD news, BYD is now outselling Tesla in Europe. Via the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/chinas-byd-outsells-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-38a63cc4\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Tesla registered 7,165 battery-electric vehicles in Europe last month, down 49% from a year earlier, according to data from JATO Dynamics, a consumer-research group. In contrast, registrations for BYD more than doubled to 7,231 vehicles.</em></p></blockquote><h5>GM builds V8 plant</h5><p>In the US, on the other hand, &#8220;slowing&#8221; EV sales have caused GM to pivot back towards internal combustion: it&#8217;s investing nearly a billion dollars in an ICE engine plant, and is planning a new V8 engine model that won&#8217;t start production until 2027. Via the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/general-motors-to-invest-888-million-in-propulsion-plant-23ea7636\">Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>General Motors has abandoned a plan to pump $300 million into electric-vehicle motor production at its upstate New York plant and will instead invest $888 million to make the latest V-8 engines.</em></p><p><em>Since the EV announcement two years ago for its Tonawanda plant, electric-vehicle sales have slowed, prompting GM and other carmakers to walk back investment plans for the technology.</em></p><p><em>The company said Tuesday its new plan marks its largest single investment in an engine plant&#8230;</em></p></blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not clear to me what &#8220;slowing EV sales&#8221; really means here. <a href=\"https://investor.gm.com/static-files/644a15dc-b57c-4e91-821d-b81baa99246b\">GM&#8217;s quarterly income presentation</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q1-2025-ev-sales/\">Cox automotive</a>, and <a href=\"https://cleantechnica.com/2025/05/28/despite-everything-tesla-still-dominates-ev-sales-in-california/\">data from California car dealerships</a>, all suggest GM EV sales are way up. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=g63SJwFdGTQ&amp;t=2340s\">Sandy Munro must be rolling in his (metaphorical) grave</a>.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-for-05312025\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

By assembling ships from welded, prefabricated blocks, the US built a huge number of cargo ships incredibly quickly, overwhelming Germany&#8217;s u-boats and helping to win the war. But when the war was over, this shipbuilding machine was dismantled. Industrialists like Henry Kaiser and Stephen Bechtel, who operated some of the US&#8217;s most efficient wartime shipyards, left the shipbuilding business. Prior to the war, the US had been an uncompetitive commercial shipbuilder producing a small fraction of commercial oceangoing ships, and that&#8217;s what it became again. At the height of the war the US was producing nearly 90% of the world&#8217;s ships. By the 1950s, it produced just over 2%.</p><p>But the lessons from the US&#8217;s shipbuilding machine weren&#8217;t forgotten. After the war, practitioners brought them to Japan, where they would continue to evolve, eventually allowing Japan to build ships faster and cheaper than almost anyone else in the world.</p><h4>Origins of Japan&#8217;s post-war shipbuilding industry</h4><p>One of the shipyards that built cargo ships during the war was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welding_Shipyards\">Welding Shipyards</a>, owned by Daniel Ludwig. In 1936 Ludwig had founded shipping company National Bulk Carriers (NBC), which bought surplus WWI cargo ships and converted them into oil tankers. From there, Ludwig expanded into shipbuilding, and built his one-berth shipyard at Norfolk in 1940.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> During the war, Welding Shipyards produced T3 tankers using prefabricated welded construction, which were then operated by National Bulk Carriers. After the war, Ludwig continued to build tankers: between 1948 and 1950 he built 5 <a href=\"https://t2tanker.org/dk-ludwig/ships-built-by-daniel-k-ludwig-and-national-bulk-carriers/bulkpetrol-ships/\">Bulkpetrol-class tankers</a>, then the largest tankers in the world.</p><p>Ludwig wanted to build even larger ships, in part to capitalize on the burgeoning iron ore trade with Venezuela, but was limited by the size of the berth at Welding Shipyards. Unfazed, Ludwig dispatched his lieutenant Elmer Hann to find a shipyard with the capacity to build larger vessels. The search brought Hann to a former naval shipyard in Kure, Japan, near Hiroshima. The Kure facilities were enormous: they had been used to build the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato\">Yamato</a>, the largest battleship in the world, and had a 100-ton gantry crane and a drydock capable of building ships of 150,000 tons deadweight. (By comparison, a Liberty ship is about 10,800 deadweight tons.) In 1951, Ludwig signed a 10-year lease for the Kure shipyard.</p><p>At Kure, National Bulk Carriers built a series of record-breakingly large ships: the 38,000 deadweight ton Petro Kure in 1952, the 45,000 deadweight ton Phoenix in 1954, and the 55,000 deadweight ton Sinclair Petro-Lore in 1955. The <a href=\"https://t2tanker.org/dk-ludwig/ships-built-by-daniel-k-ludwig-and-national-bulk-carriers/universe-apollo/\">Universe Apollo</a>, launched at Kure in 1958, was the first tanker in the world to exceed 100,000 deadweight tons. Altogether Ludwig built 42 ships at Kure, many of them the largest in the world when completed. When his lease at Kure expired, the shipyards were acquired by Japanese shipbuilder IHI, which continued to build enormous tankers for Ludwig.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wxQKQ/2/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6becd176-24e6-496c-b360-120d33a5ec39_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Largest Tankers in the World&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Tankers built by National Bulk Carriers at Kure that were the largest in the world when launched.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wxQKQ/2/\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><h4>Kure and modern shipbuilding methods</h4><p>Modern shipbuilding methods were born at Kure in the 1950s, by combining three different strategies for industrial process improvement.</p><p>The first strategy was the prefabricated, welded shipbuilding methods that the US had used so successfully during WWII. To briefly recap, prior to WWII ships were largely built in-place by riveting together the hull one piece at a time. This was time-consuming (a Liberty-sized ship could take months to produce) and labor-intensive, in part because riveting took a long time, and in part because so much of the work was done in the confines of the partially-built ship. Replacing riveting with welding allowed for faster assembly, and also saved steel (since welded plates didn&#8217;t need to overlap like riveted plates did). And by constructing the ship out of large, prefabricated blocks, work could be moved out of the confines of the ship and into specialized assembly areas where it could be more easily performed and more workers could work on the ship at once, increasing speed and improving efficiency.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png\" width=\"478\" height=\"531.4302884615385\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:925,&quot;width&quot;:832,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:478,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xERS!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb49b304-738a-49c9-ac71-d9a41f5edcfb_832x925.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Prefabricated block being lifted into place at Oregonship during WWII.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Both Elmer Hann and Danield Ludwig were well-versed in welded, prefabricated shipbuilding. Ludwig had used it at Welding Shipyards to build T3 and Bulkpetrol-class tankers, and Elmer Hann had been the superintendent for Henry Kaiser&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Island_Shipyard\">Swan Island shipyard</a>, which used welded, prefabricated construction to produce 147 T2 tankers over the course of the war.</p><p>Japanese shipbuilders weren&#8217;t completely unfamiliar with these methods. Welding had been used to a limited extent on Japanese naval vessels during the war, and Japan had also used both welding and prefabrication to build &#8220;standard&#8221; merchant ships, not unlike the US&#8217;s shipbuilding program. But the Japanese efforts were small compared to what had been achieved in the US, and it was Hann and Ludwig&#8217;s extensive experience (especially Hann&#8217;s) with welding and prefabrication that accelerated their adoption at Kure.</p><p>The second strategy that became part of modern shipbuilding methods came from aircraft manufacturing. Kure&#8217;s chief engineer Hisashi Shinto had briefly worked in aircraft design during the war, and had been struck by the system of drawings the industry used. Aircraft were manufactured by producing large sections (fuselage, wings, etc.) that were then joined together. These sections were built using a detailed set of drawings that described exactly what materials were needed and what operations were performed at each step in the assembly process. Shinto thought that such a system might be profitably applied to shipbuilding, and he was given the chance to implement it when NBC began operations at Kure.</p><p>The third strategy that formed the core of modern shipbuilding methods was statistical process control. The basic idea behind process control is that it&#8217;s impossible to make an industrial process perfectly reliable. There will always be some variation in what it produces: differences in part dimensions, material strength, chemical composition, and so on. But while some variation is inherent to the process (and must be accepted), much of the variation is from specific causes that can be hunted down and eliminated. By analyzing the variation in a process, undesirable sources of variation can be removed. This makes a process work more reliably and predictably, reducing waste and rework from parts that are outside acceptable tolerances.</p><p>Statistical process control originated in AT&amp;T&#8217;s Western Electric subsidiary with the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_A._Shewhart\">Walter Shewhart</a> (another major achievement of Bell Labs), and was brought to Japan after the war by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming\">W. Edwards Deming</a>. Deming gave 35 lectures on statistical control in Japan in 1950, and over the next two decades nearly 15,000 Japanese engineers &#8212; and thousands more factory foremen &#8212; were trained in statistical control methods. Statistical methods were enthusiastically adopted in shipbuilding, and they became the third key component needed for a new method of shipbuilding to emerge.</p><h4>How the system works</h4><p>These three strategies worked together, supporting and reinforcing each other. The basic idea is simple: doing work on or in a ship as it&#8217;s being built is difficult. Conditions are cramped, the orientation of the work is often awkward (requiring scaffolding or overhead working), the lack of space makes it hard to use equipment or automate labor, and so on. The more that work can be done earlier in the process, before the ship is being assembled, the easier and faster it will be to do. Japanese shipbuilder IHI estimated that work that took one labor-hour in the early fabrication process would take 8 hours when done during final ship assembly, and 12 hours when done after the ship had launched.</p><p>Prefabricated block construction makes it possible to do more work earlier in the assembly process. By making subassemblies incorporating various ship systems (parts of the hull, piping, wiring, etc.), and then stitching those subassemblies together, much of the work can be completed long before the ship is being put together. And because this work is done in fabrication shops with the aid of jigs, fixtures, and automated equipment, it can be done much more quickly than if it were done on the ship itself. For instance, cranes can be used to rotate assemblies so welding can be done downhand (below the worker), which is much faster and easier than welding vertically or overhead. Completed subassemblies are stitched together into semi-blocks, semi-blocks into blocks, and (sometimes) blocks into grand blocks, which are then stitched together to form the ship itself.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png\" width=\"609\" height=\"513.1057579318449\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:717,&quot;width&quot;:851,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:609,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ecdk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23b5fd24-dc53-4743-9229-75fd307fe852_851x717.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Block assembly, via NSRP.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Block construction had been widely adopted by US Maritime Commission shipyards during WWII, but Japan pushed the technique much farther. Blocks grew to be larger and heavier. WWII Maritime Commission shipyard cranes generally had 25 to 30 ton capacities, but the gantry crane at Kure could lift 100 tons, and by the 1960s Japanese shipyards were installing huge &#8220;Goliath&#8221; cranes with capacities of 300 tons or more.</p><p>Blocks got heavier not only because they got larger, but because Japanese yards installed as many components and systems as possible in the early assembly stages where the work was easier to do. Things that had traditionally been installed during the final outfitting process were pushed upstream and installed earlier. Cabling, for instance, could be installed on blocks prior to the blocks being stitched together, allowing for more efficient downhand cable installation.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"882\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/de948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:882,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!OA4f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde948417-d7e9-414e-84bd-4816f7f26400_1458x883.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Diagram of block assembly used at Mitsubishi, Via Thorell et al 1987.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Building a ship from blocks with many parts and systems already installed required carefully tracking and managing the flow of components, to ensure that everything was where it needed to be at the exact right time. If a part wasn&#8217;t available, the entire system would grind to a halt until it could be installed, potentially holding up everything downstream of that particular process. Assembling high level-of-completion blocks thus required a production control system similar to the one Shinto had observed in aircraft manufacturing during the war. The system as practiced in shipbuilding became known as &#8220;zone outfitting.&#8221; Drawings showing every system to be installed on a given assembly or block would be produced, listing every part or component needed at each stage in the process. Based on these drawings and part lists, pallets of material would be arranged and delivered to the proper assembly site exactly when they were needed.</p><p>Stitching together high level-of-completion blocks demanded both a carefully orchestrated flow of materials and a high degree of accuracy. Without it, parts wouldn&#8217;t align when assemblies or blocks were being joined, requiring laborious and time-consuming repairs or rework to get things to fit. This lack of accuracy was a weakness of WWII-era prefabrication: variation in parts (in part due to insufficiently precise machine tools) meant that a lot of manual fitting was still required to get parts to fit together properly. To minimize these wasteful efforts, Japanese shipbuilders adopted statistical process control methods to analyze and remove sources of unwanted variation and distortion. These methods, in concert with things like more accurate welding methods and <a href=\"https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA443648\">line heating</a> (which allowed for very accurate shaping of steel plates), greatly increased accuracy and streamlined the assembly process.</p><p>Statistical process control methods require some degree of repetition in the work that&#8217;s being performed: tracking averages and standard deviations only works when you&#8217;re doing similar tasks over and over again. To achieve this, Japanese shipyard fabrication operations were divided into &#8220;process lanes,&#8221; where each lane was dedicated to doing particular types of work. One area of the shipyard might be devoted to fabricating hull sections, which would then be divided into lanes for making curved steel plate assemblies, flat steel plate assemblies, assemblies out of steel shapes, and so on. Process lanes in other parts of the yard might be devoted to making piping assemblies, or for installing certain types of components. This sort of division of shipyard labor had been used in Maritime Commission yards during WWII, but was once again pushed even further by the Japanese by coupling it with statistical control methods.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png\" width=\"1044\" height=\"800\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:800,&quot;width&quot;:1044,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sTEY!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcff7384f-d44d-4e72-a0a1-468baf934de5_1044x800.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Schematic process lane breakdown, via NSRP.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to statistical benefits, dividing shipyards into process lanes made other efficiency improvements possible. Shipyards, even large ones, aren&#8217;t mass production operations. A mass production operation will produce thousands or millions of near-identical products each year. Today the largest shipyard in the world, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/asia/2025/02/20/only-asia-can-help-america-counter-chinas-shipbuilding-prowess\">Hyundai&#8217;s Ulsan shipyard</a>, only produces a few dozen ships per year, many if not most of them unique. But by breaking down a ship into similar sorts of assemblies, and having those assemblies fabricated in dedicated areas of a shipyard, many of the benefits of mass production can be obtained. Material flow between different process steps can be smoother, and setups (the time it takes to prepare to do a certain task) can be greatly reduced. Equipment dedicated to performing certain tasks can be located where it&#8217;s needed, repetitive operations can be automated or streamlined, and problems that repeatedly appear doing certain types of work can more easily be solved.</p><p>(Grouping high-variance work into clusters of similarity, and devoting areas of a factory to producing clusters of similar parts, is an industrial improvement method known as &#8220;Group Technology,&#8221; which became popular in the 1960s. Japanese shipyards don&#8217;t appear to have adopted Group Technology specifically, but they independently converged on many of the same principles, and modern descriptions describe the early Japanese yards as working on &#8220;the logic of Group Technology.&#8221;)</p><p>By combining welded block assembly methods, aircraft-style production control systems, and statistical process control, Japanese shipbuilders at Kure created a whole new method of building ships. While the ideas behind the method are easy enough to explain, actually adopting the system was difficult. It required much more work upfront to create a block-by-block breakdown of an entire ship, complete with a list of exactly what parts were needed when. More monitoring and oversight was needed to hunt down and eliminate sources of variation and keep processes within statistical boundaries, which in turn required highly skilled managers (Japan was notable for having very large numbers of shipyard managers with university degrees compared to the US.) Huge investments in shipyard infrastructure were required: in cranes that could lift the huge blocks, in large drydocks, in new yards arranged to have an efficient flow of material and room to store work in process. And it required a great deal of coordination and schedule discipline to ensure everything, from materials on individual pallets to hundred-ton grand blocks, were ready for installation at the proper time.</p><p>Implementing the system was difficult. But when it worked, it allowed Japan to build ships dramatically faster and cheaper.</p><h4>How the system came together</h4><p>This new method of shipbuilding didn&#8217;t appear fully formed, but gradually evolved over a turbulent few decades for the shipping and shipbuilding industries.</p><p>In the aftermath of WWII, Japan&#8217;s economy was in shambles. Shipping had been hit especially hard: 80% of Japan&#8217;s ships (by tonnage) had been lost during the war, and most of the ships that remained were small, outdated, or damaged. After the Allies (in practice, the US) took control of Japan in 1945, shipyards were ordered to cease production of new ships, and there were tentative plans to remove much of Japan&#8217;s shipbuilding infrastructure and give it to the allies as war reparations. But the US eventually realized that Japan was so dependent on imports that hamstringing its shipping and shipbuilding would make it permanently dependent on US support, and that a strong Japan would be a useful ally against a rising Soviet Union. Allied policy thus turned to encouraging Japan&#8217;s shipping and shipbuilding industry to expand. To kickstart the industry, in 1947 the Japanese government created a &#8220;Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme&#8221;: the government would decide how many and what sort of new ships should be built, and fund their construction by making low-cost loans to Japanese shipowners to purchase them. The Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme <a href=\"https://bizgate.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOLM220FS022042024000000?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">continued into the 1980s</a>, and while it eventually became less important once Japan began building large numbers of ships for export, in the late 1940s and early 1950s it gave crucial support to the shipbuilding industry, and was responsible for the vast majority of new shipping tonnage built. By 1949, 270,000 gross tons of merchant ships (roughly equal to 36 Liberty Ships) were being built under the scheme.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png\" width=\"606\" height=\"384.6941649899396\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:631,&quot;width&quot;:994,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:606,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!trKr!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1553c1f7-94ac-4049-9871-87428cefa6c1_994x631.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Percent of ships built under programmed shipbuilding program, via Motora 1997.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Japanese shipbuilders got another boost following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, which created a huge (though brief) demand for new ships. Thanks to an influx of foreign orders, between 1949 and 1953 the tonnage produce for foreign export at Japanese shipyards rose from 3,700 tons to more than 300,000 tons.</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCWT3/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06719e78-5057-4b89-85f7-dce77c7315f4_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Japanese Ship Exports&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Thousands of displacement tons produced for export&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/gCWT3/1/\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p>At this point, Japanese ships were still much more expensive than British or European ships: foreign orders came not because of low prices or good service but because demand was incredibly high and shipowners were placing orders in any yard that had capacity. Japanese labor costs were much lower than in other shipbuilding countries, but its steel was more expensive, and Japan&#8217;s overall shipbuilding efficiency was low. But Japanese shipbuilders, the government, and other organizations like the Society of Naval Architects of Japan all worked diligently to strengthen the industry. The quality of welding was improved, and difficult-to-weld &#8220;rimmed&#8221; steel was replaced with easier-to-weld &#8220;killed&#8221; steel. By the mid-1950s essentially all Japanese ships were built using welded construction, up from just 20% in 1948. Labor efficiency was improved by introducing automatic machines for <a href=\"https://www.laserfocusworld.com/industrial-laser-solutions/article/14215415/laser-bevel-cutting-in-japans-shipyards\">marking</a>, welding, and cutting plates. The government created a program to supply steel to shipbuilders at low rates, and the Japanese steel industry built large, modern facilities, eventually lowering their production costs.</p><p>It was in this context of an industry that Japan was already hard at work improving that NBC began operations at Kure. As part of NBC&#8217;s lease arrangement with the Japanese government, engineers from other shipyards were allowed to observe the Kure yard and to be trained in the new methods being developed there. Over the 10 years of NBC&#8217;s lease, 4-5,000 engineers were taught the new methods. As other Japanese shipbuilders began to adopt the new methods, they made huge investments in modernizing their shipyards and installing new equipment</p><p>These efforts quickly bore fruit. Between 1949 and 1956, the labor-hours per ton of ship fell by nearly 50% in Japanese shipyards, and the time required to launch a ship fell from 8.5 months to 6 months. The worldwide shipbuilding market declined following the end of the Korean War, but then quickly boomed again. Foreign orders for Japanese ships skyrocketed, and by 1956 Japan surpassed the UK to become the largest commercial shipbuilder in the world.</p><p>And Japan didn&#8217;t stop there. The Suez Canal closed in 1956 due to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis\">Suez Crisis</a>, creating a demand for the exact sort of large tankers that Daniel Ludwig set out to build at Kure and that Japan was becoming an expert in. The shipbuilding market declined following the reopening of the Suez Canal in 1957, but then bounced back even stronger than before, and Japan&#8217;s newfound efficiency allowed it to capture a larger market share even while global orders were declining.</p><p>Japanese shipbuilders continued to improve their ship designs and the methods for building them. They developed new, more efficient hull forms, such as the &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbous_bow\">bulbous bow</a>&#8221; which reduced drag from waves. Steel plates were made thinner, and tankers were redesigned to require fewer internal supports. A variety of new welding technology was introduced, including better electrodes, mechanical &#8220;<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/weldingcutting0000houl/page/64/mode/2up?q=%22gravity+welding%22\">gravity welding</a>&#8221; machines, one-sided welding (eliminating the need to weld on both sides of a steel plate), and high-speed gas welding.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png\" width=\"498\" height=\"373.5\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:498,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PVfk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2e0cfe41-522a-45be-aaf3-1688bc4fd10a_1600x1200.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbous_bow\">Bulbous bow, via Wikipedia.</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The shipbuilding methods introduced at Kure also continued to be developed. Shipyards found ways to move outfitting and final assembly work earlier in the process, where it could be done more easily and efficiently: by the 1980s, IHI was installing 80% of a ship&#8217;s piping before final assembly. Automatic material handling systems were installed. Process flow lanes were further refined, and fabrication accuracy continued to improve. Parts (and even whole ships) were standardized, reducing design and communication overheads and improving manufacturing efficiency. These and other changes were due to deliberate attempts at continuous improvement, and were often generated by small groups of employees working in &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_circle#:~:text=A%20quality%20circle%20or%20quality,and%20solve%20work%2Drelated%20problems.\">quality circles</a>.&#8221;</p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SaJws/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38c33463-92b4-4950-a123-fe51cd573aab_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Japanese vs UK Shipbuilding&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Thousands of gross tons produced per year.&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"DatawrapperToDOM\"><iframe id=\"iframe-datawrapper\" class=\"datawrapper-iframe\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SaJws/1/\" width=\"730\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();</script></div><p>Japanese shipyards also continued to make large infrastructure investments, in some cases building new shipyards far in areas that had large amounts of available land and ready supplies of labor.

Between 1958 and 1964, labor-hours per gross ton of Japanese shipyards fell by 60%, and by 1970 had fallen even more. (This efficiency meant that even as Japanese labor costs rose, the labor fraction of the cost of a new ship stayed relatively constant.) Larger ships and more efficient ship designs meant that the amount of steel required per ton of capacity declined by 36% between 1958 and 1964. In the late 1940s it took 10 months to build and launch a cargo ship in Japanese shipyards. By 1970 it took only around 3 months, even though the 1970 ships were 10 times the size.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p><div id=\"datawrapper-iframe\" class=\"datawrapper-wrap outer\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/W5EEn/1/&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d91bb215-ebb2-487f-8b16-f743079dba15_1260x660.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Japanese Shipbuilding Efficiency&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Steel and labor required per gross ton of ship.

By 1970, that fraction had risen to nearly 50%. And as world demand for ships continued to skyrocket in the &#8216;60s and early &#8216;70s (accelerated by the Suez Canal closing again in 1967, Japan&#8217;s shipbuilding output increased enormously. By 1973, Japan was building over 17 million gross tons of cargo ships a year, nearly as much as the 19 million tons of Liberty Ships the US built over the entire course of WWII.</p><p>An illustration of just how far Japanese shipbuilders had come came in 1970, when the US instituted the &#8220;National Shipbuilding Research Program&#8221; (NSRP) in an attempt to improve US shipbuilding efficiency. The main targets of this program were Japanese shipyards, which by the 1970s were building ships more than twice as fast as the US for less than half the cost. Over the next several decades, US shipbuilders would try to learn the Japan shipbuilding techniques that had originated in the US so many years ago. (Ironically, many of the US organizations involved in this effort were behind the pioneering shipbuilding efforts during WWII. The NSRP was spearheaded by the <a href=\"https://www.maritime.dot.gov/\">Maritime Administration</a>, the descendant of the US Maritime Commission that orchestrated the construction of thousands of Liberty Ships. And one of the participants was Todd Shipyards, the shipbuilder which partnered with Henry Kaiser and the Six Companies to build and operate the first emergency shipyards for the Maritime Commission during the war.)</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>What lessons can we learn from Japan&#8217;s successful effort to develop a shipbuilding industry?</p><p>One is that government support was very important. Early on, the Japanese government pumped a lot of money into the industry through things like the Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme and the deal that gave shipbuilders access to low-cost steel, and provided key support in other ways (like arranging for other shipyard engineers to visit NBC&#8217;s operations at Kure).</p><p>More generally, it helped enormously to have major organizations and centers of power working with the revitalization effort, or at least not opposing it. Japanese unions, for instance, weren't organized by craft (welders, boilermakers, etc.), but were &#8220;house&#8221; unions for each individual shipbuilder (which later organized into one larger umbrella union). This made them more flexible with regards to changing how the work was done. As long as employment wasn&#8217;t reduced, the Japanese unions did not oppose the dramatic work rearrangements that the new shipbuilding methods required. In the UK, on the other hand, shipbuilding unions resisted this reorganization, which hamstrung the country&#8217;s efforts to modernize its industry.</p><p>Another lesson is that luck can be a major factor in the arc of industrial development. Japan ultimately benefited enormously from NBC&#8217;s Kure operations, which were only set up there because Japanese shipyards had survived the war intact. And Japan benefited from several major tailwinds (the Korean war creating demand for even inefficient shipbuilding, and the Suez Crisis stoking demand for the large tankers Japanese yards had become experts at building). I doubt that these were make or break in whether the industry flourished or not (for one, Japan had many similar industrial successes), but they probably helped it become as dominant as it was.</p><p>Another important and perhaps underrated factor in industrial success is simply the will to succeed. As I noted in my essay on <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships\">why the US can&#8217;t build ships</a>, the Japanese had a &#8220;burning zeal&#8221; to make their shipbuilding industry among the best in the world. Shipbuilders in Korea (which succeeded Japan as the world&#8217;s biggest shipbuilder) seemed similarly motivated. The US, on the other hand, has never been able to marshal the will to do what it takes to make its industry internationally competitive, and US shipyards often seem to lack motivation to improve. A Japanese shipyard executive engaged to help US shipyards improve their operations <a href=\"https://onepetro.org/JSPD/article-abstract/4/02/104/173807/IHI-s-Experience-of-Technical-Transfer-and-Some\">noted in the 1980s</a> that the US yards labor hour reduction &#8220;did not reach the level that IHI had expected&#8221; and that &#8220;people who perform production engineering seem rather passive.&#8221; You get a similar sense when reading about post-war UK shipbuilding: that it simply lacked the motivation to improve until it was way too late.</p><p>And finally, Japan&#8217;s shipbuilding efforts show that very high levels of coordination make extremely impressive things possible. The shipbuilding techniques developed in Japan demand a great deal of coordination &#8212; between shipowners and designers, between designers and production, between the shipyard and supplier &#8212; and the organization needs to be structured to allow such coordination. Hisashi Shinto criticized the US system of having ship design done by outside consultants rather than in-house by the shipyard, describing it as &#8220;beyond our comprehension&#8221;, and Todd shipyard executives noted that &#8220;If the key to Japanese productivity were to be summed up in one word, that word would be \"communication.\"&#8221; (One way to get this coordination is vertical integration, but it&#8217;s not the only way: Japanese shipyards outsourced a large fraction of their work, and also made heavy use of temporary workers, but were nevertheless able to closely coordinate with their suppliers to get what they need when they need it.)</p><p>I suspect that coordination failures are behind a lot of industrial dysfunction &#8211; you can see them at work in <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/fixing-naval-ship-acquisition\">naval shipbuilding</a>, for instance, and it&#8217;s also part of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction\">what makes construction innovation so difficult</a> &#8211; and understanding why they occur and how they could be improved might be an underrated avenue for industrial improvement.</p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Sources seem to disagree on this.

By assembling ships from welded, prefabricated blocks, the US built a huge number of cargo ships incredibly quickly, overwhelming Germany’s u-boats and helping to win the war. But when the war was over, this shipbuilding machine was dismantled. Industrialists like Henry Kaiser and Stephen Bechtel, who operated some of the US’s most efficient wartime shipyards, left the shipbuilding business. Prior to the war, the US had been an uncompetitive commercial shipbuilder producing a small fraction of commercial oceangoing ships, and that’s what it became again. At the height of the war the US was producing nearly 90% of the world’s ships. By the 1950s, it produced just over 2%.\nBut the lessons from the US’s shipbuilding machine weren’t forgotten. After the war, practitioners brought them to Japan, where they would continue to evolve, eventually allowing Japan to build ships faster and cheaper than almost anyone else in the world.\nOrigins of Japan’s post-war shipbuilding industry\nOne of the shipyards that built cargo ships during the war was Welding Shipyards, owned by Daniel Ludwig. In 1936 Ludwig had founded shipping company National Bulk Carriers (NBC), which bought surplus WWI cargo ships and converted them into oil tankers. From there, Ludwig expanded into shipbuilding, and built his one-berth shipyard at Norfolk in 1940. 1 During the war, Welding Shipyards produced T3 tankers using prefabricated welded construction, which were then operated by National Bulk Carriers. After the war, Ludwig continued to build tankers: between 1948 and 1950 he built 5 Bulkpetrol-class tankers, then the largest tankers in the world.\nLudwig wanted to build even larger ships, in part to capitalize on the burgeoning iron ore trade with Venezuela, but was limited by the size of the berth at Welding Shipyards. Unfazed, Ludwig dispatched his lieutenant Elmer Hann to find a shipyard with the capacity to build larger vessels. The search brought Hann to a former naval shipyard in Kure, Japan, near Hiroshima. The Kure facilities were enormous: they had been used to build the Yamato, the largest battleship in the world, and had a 100-ton gantry crane and a drydock capable of building ships of 150,000 tons deadweight. (By comparison, a Liberty ship is about 10,800 deadweight tons.) In 1951, Ludwig signed a 10-year lease for the Kure shipyard.\nAt Kure, National Bulk Carriers built a series of record-breakingly large ships: the 38,000 deadweight ton Petro Kure in 1952, the 45,000 deadweight ton Phoenix in 1954, and the 55,000 deadweight ton Sinclair Petro-Lore in 1955. The Universe Apollo, launched at Kure in 1958, was the first tanker in the world to exceed 100,000 deadweight tons. Altogether Ludwig built 42 ships at Kure, many of them the largest in the world when completed. When his lease at Kure expired, the shipyards were acquired by Japanese shipbuilder IHI, which continued to build enormous tankers for Ludwig.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nKure and modern shipbuilding methods\nModern shipbuilding methods were born at Kure in the 1950s, by combining three different strategies for industrial process improvement.\nThe first strategy was the prefabricated, welded shipbuilding methods that the US had used so successfully during WWII. To briefly recap, prior to WWII ships were largely built in-place by riveting together the hull one piece at a time. This was time-consuming (a Liberty-sized ship could take months to produce) and labor-intensive, in part because riveting took a long time, and in part because so much of the work was done in the confines of the partially-built ship. Replacing riveting with welding allowed for faster assembly, and also saved steel (since welded plates didn’t need to overlap like riveted plates did). And by constructing the ship out of large, prefabricated blocks, work could be moved out of the confines of the ship and into specialized assembly areas where it could be more easily performed and more workers could work on the ship at once, increasing speed and improving efficiency.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nPrefabricated block being lifted into place at Oregonship during WWII.\nBoth Elmer Hann and Danield Ludwig were well-versed in welded, prefabricated shipbuilding. Ludwig had used it at Welding Shipyards to build T3 and Bulkpetrol-class tankers, and Elmer Hann had been the superintendent for Henry Kaiser’s Swan Island shipyard, which used welded, prefabricated construction to produce 147 T2 tankers over the course of the war.\nJapanese shipbuilders weren’t completely unfamiliar with these methods. Welding had been used to a limited extent on Japanese naval vessels during the war, and Japan had also used both welding and prefabrication to build “standard” merchant ships, not unlike the US’s shipbuilding program. But the Japanese efforts were small compared to what had been achieved in the US, and it was Hann and Ludwig’s extensive experience (especially Hann’s) with welding and prefabrication that accelerated their adoption at Kure.\nThe second strategy that became part of modern shipbuilding methods came from aircraft manufacturing. Kure’s chief engineer Hisashi Shinto had briefly worked in aircraft design during the war, and had been struck by the system of drawings the industry used. Aircraft were manufactured by producing large sections (fuselage, wings, etc.) that were then joined together. These sections were built using a detailed set of drawings that described exactly what materials were needed and what operations were performed at each step in the assembly process. Shinto thought that such a system might be profitably applied to shipbuilding, and he was given the chance to implement it when NBC began operations at Kure.\nThe third strategy that formed the core of modern shipbuilding methods was statistical process control. The basic idea behind process control is that it’s impossible to make an industrial process perfectly reliable. There will always be some variation in what it produces: differences in part dimensions, material strength, chemical composition, and so on. But while some variation is inherent to the process (and must be accepted), much of the variation is from specific causes that can be hunted down and eliminated. By analyzing the variation in a process, undesirable sources of variation can be removed. This makes a process work more reliably and predictably, reducing waste and rework from parts that are outside acceptable tolerances.\nStatistical process control originated in AT&T’s Western Electric subsidiary with the work of Walter Shewhart(another major achievement of Bell Labs), and was brought to Japan after the war by W. Edwards Deming. Deming gave 35 lectures on statistical control in Japan in 1950, and over the next two decades nearly 15,000 Japanese engineers — and thousands more factory foremen — were trained in statistical control methods. Statistical methods were enthusiastically adopted in shipbuilding, and they became the third key component needed for a new method of shipbuilding to emerge.\nHow the system works\nThese three strategies worked together, supporting and reinforcing each other. The basic idea is simple: doing work on or in a ship as it’s being built is difficult. Conditions are cramped, the orientation of the work is often awkward (requiring scaffolding or overhead working), the lack of space makes it hard to use equipment or automate labor, and so on. The more that work can be done earlier in the process, before the ship is being assembled, the easier and faster it will be to do. Japanese shipbuilder IHI estimated that work that took one labor-hour in the early fabrication process would take 8 hours when done during final ship assembly, and 12 hours when done after the ship had launched.\nPrefabricated block construction makes it possible to do more work earlier in the assembly process. By making subassemblies incorporating various ship systems (parts of the hull, piping, wiring, etc.), and then stitching those subassemblies together, much of the work can be completed long before the ship is being put together. And because this work is done in fabrication shops with the aid of jigs, fixtures, and automated equipment, it can be done much more quickly than if it were done on the ship itself. For instance, cranes can be used to rotate assemblies so welding can be done downhand (below the worker), which is much faster and easier than welding vertically or overhead. Completed subassemblies are stitched together into semi-blocks, semi-blocks into blocks, and (sometimes) blocks into grand blocks, which are then stitched together to form the ship itself.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBlock assembly, via NSRP.\nBlock construction had been widely adopted by US Maritime Commission shipyards during WWII, but Japan pushed the technique much farther. Blocks grew to be larger and heavier. WWII Maritime Commission shipyard cranes generally had 25 to 30 ton capacities, but the gantry crane at Kure could lift 100 tons, and by the 1960s Japanese shipyards were installing huge “Goliath” cranes with capacities of 300 tons or more.\nBlocks got heavier not only because they got larger, but because Japanese yards installed as many components and systems as possible in the early assembly stages where the work was easier to do. Things that had traditionally been installed during the final outfitting process were pushed upstream and installed earlier. Cabling, for instance, could be installed on blocks prior to the blocks being stitched together, allowing for more efficient downhand cable installation.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nDiagram of block assembly used at Mitsubishi, Via Thorell et al 1987.\nBuilding a ship from blocks with many parts and systems already installed required carefully tracking and managing the flow of components, to ensure that everything was where it needed to be at the exact right time. If a part wasn’t available, the entire system would grind to a halt until it could be installed, potentially holding up everything downstream of that particular process. Assembling high level-of-completion blocks thus required a production control system similar to the one Shinto had observed in aircraft manufacturing during the war. The system as practiced in shipbuilding became known as “zone outfitting.” Drawings showing every system to be installed on a given assembly or block would be produced, listing every part or component needed at each stage in the process. Based on these drawings and part lists, pallets of material would be arranged and delivered to the proper assembly site exactly when they were needed.\nStitching together high level-of-completion blocks demanded both a carefully orchestrated flow of materials and a high degree of accuracy. Without it, parts wouldn’t align when assemblies or blocks were being joined, requiring laborious and time-consuming repairs or rework to get things to fit. This lack of accuracy was a weakness of WWII-era prefabrication: variation in parts (in part due to insufficiently precise machine tools) meant that a lot of manual fitting was still required to get parts to fit together properly. To minimize these wasteful efforts, Japanese shipbuilders adopted statistical process control methods to analyze and remove sources of unwanted variation and distortion. These methods, in concert with things like more accurate welding methods and line heating(which allowed for very accurate shaping of steel plates), greatly increased accuracy and streamlined the assembly process.\nStatistical process control methods require some degree of repetition in the work that’s being performed: tracking averages and standard deviations only works when you’re doing similar tasks over and over again. To achieve this, Japanese shipyard fabrication operations were divided into “process lanes,” where each lane was dedicated to doing particular types of work. One area of the shipyard might be devoted to fabricating hull sections, which would then be divided into lanes for making curved steel plate assemblies, flat steel plate assemblies, assemblies out of steel shapes, and so on. Process lanes in other parts of the yard might be devoted to making piping assemblies, or for installing certain types of components. This sort of division of shipyard labor had been used in Maritime Commission yards during WWII, but was once again pushed even further by the Japanese by coupling it with statistical control methods.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSchematic process lane breakdown, via NSRP.\nIn addition to statistical benefits, dividing shipyards into process lanes made other efficiency improvements possible. Shipyards, even large ones, aren’t mass production operations. A mass production operation will produce thousands or millions of near-identical products each year. Today the largest shipyard in the world, Hyundai’s Ulsan shipyard, only produces a few dozen ships per year, many if not most of them unique. But by breaking down a ship into similar sorts of assemblies, and having those assemblies fabricated in dedicated areas of a shipyard, many of the benefits of mass production can be obtained. Material flow between different process steps can be smoother, and setups (the time it takes to prepare to do a certain task) can be greatly reduced. Equipment dedicated to performing certain tasks can be located where it’s needed, repetitive operations can be automated or streamlined, and problems that repeatedly appear doing certain types of work can more easily be solved.\n(Grouping high-variance work into clusters of similarity, and devoting areas of a factory to producing clusters of similar parts, is an industrial improvement method known as “Group Technology,” which became popular in the 1960s. Japanese shipyards don’t appear to have adopted Group Technology specifically, but they independently converged on many of the same principles, and modern descriptions describe the early Japanese yards as working on “the logic of Group Technology.”)\nBy combining welded block assembly methods, aircraft-style production control systems, and statistical process control, Japanese shipbuilders at Kure created a whole new method of building ships. While the ideas behind the method are easy enough to explain, actually adopting the system was difficult. It required much more work upfront to create a block-by-block breakdown of an entire ship, complete with a list of exactly what parts were needed when. More monitoring and oversight was needed to hunt down and eliminate sources of variation and keep processes within statistical boundaries, which in turn required highly skilled managers (Japan was notable for having very large numbers of shipyard managers with university degrees compared to the US.) Huge investments in shipyard infrastructure were required: in cranes that could lift the huge blocks, in large drydocks, in new yards arranged to have an efficient flow of material and room to store work in process. And it required a great deal of coordination and schedule discipline to ensure everything, from materials on individual pallets to hundred-ton grand blocks, were ready for installation at the proper time.\nImplementing the system was difficult. But when it worked, it allowed Japan to build ships dramatically faster and cheaper.\nHow the system came together\nThis new method of shipbuilding didn’t appear fully formed, but gradually evolved over a turbulent few decades for the shipping and shipbuilding industries.\nIn the aftermath of WWII, Japan’s economy was in shambles. Shipping had been hit especially hard: 80% of Japan’s ships (by tonnage) had been lost during the war, and most of the ships that remained were small, outdated, or damaged. After the Allies (in practice, the US) took control of Japan in 1945, shipyards were ordered to cease production of new ships, and there were tentative plans to remove much of Japan’s shipbuilding infrastructure and give it to the allies as war reparations. But the US eventually realized that Japan was so dependent on imports that hamstringing its shipping and shipbuilding would make it permanently dependent on US support, and that a strong Japan would be a useful ally against a rising Soviet Union. Allied policy thus turned to encouraging Japan’s shipping and shipbuilding industry to expand. To kickstart the industry, in 1947 the Japanese government created a “Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme”: the government would decide how many and what sort of new ships should be built, and fund their construction by making low-cost loans to Japanese shipowners to purchase them. The Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme continued into the 1980s, and while it eventually became less important once Japan began building large numbers of ships for export, in the late 1940s and early 1950s it gave crucial support to the shipbuilding industry, and was responsible for the vast majority of new shipping tonnage built. By 1949, 270,000 gross tons of merchant ships (roughly equal to 36 Liberty Ships) were being built under the scheme.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nPercent of ships built under programmed shipbuilding program, via Motora 1997.\nJapanese shipbuilders got another boost following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, which created a huge (though brief) demand for new ships. Thanks to an influx of foreign orders, between 1949 and 1953 the tonnage produce for foreign export at Japanese shipyards rose from 3,700 tons to more than 300,000 tons.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nAt this point, Japanese ships were still much more expensive than British or European ships: foreign orders came not because of low prices or good service but because demand was incredibly high and shipowners were placing orders in any yard that had capacity. Japanese labor costs were much lower than in other shipbuilding countries, but its steel was more expensive, and Japan’s overall shipbuilding efficiency was low. But Japanese shipbuilders, the government, and other organizations like the Society of Naval Architects of Japan all worked diligently to strengthen the industry. The quality of welding was improved, and difficult-to-weld “rimmed” steel was replaced with easier-to-weld “killed” steel. By the mid-1950s essentially all Japanese ships were built using welded construction, up from just 20% in 1948. Labor efficiency was improved by introducing automatic machines for marking, welding, and cutting plates. The government created a program to supply steel to shipbuilders at low rates, and the Japanese steel industry built large, modern facilities, eventually lowering their production costs.\nIt was in this context of an industry that Japan was already hard at work improving that NBC began operations at Kure. As part of NBC’s lease arrangement with the Japanese government, engineers from other shipyards were allowed to observe the Kure yard and to be trained in the new methods being developed there. Over the 10 years of NBC’s lease, 4-5,000 engineers were taught the new methods. As other Japanese shipbuilders began to adopt the new methods, they made huge investments in modernizing their shipyards and installing new equipment\nThese efforts quickly bore fruit. Between 1949 and 1956, the labor-hours per ton of ship fell by nearly 50% in Japanese shipyards, and the time required to launch a ship fell from 8.5 months to 6 months. The worldwide shipbuilding market declined following the end of the Korean War, but then quickly boomed again. Foreign orders for Japanese ships skyrocketed, and by 1956 Japan surpassed the UK to become the largest commercial shipbuilder in the world.\nAnd Japan didn’t stop there. The Suez Canal closed in 1956 due to the Suez Crisis, creating a demand for the exact sort of large tankers that Daniel Ludwig set out to build at Kure and that Japan was becoming an expert in. The shipbuilding market declined following the reopening of the Suez Canal in 1957, but then bounced back even stronger than before, and Japan’s newfound efficiency allowed it to capture a larger market share even while global orders were declining.\nJapanese shipbuilders continued to improve their ship designs and the methods for building them. They developed new, more efficient hull forms, such as the “ bulbous bow ” which reduced drag from waves. Steel plates were made thinner, and tankers were redesigned to require fewer internal supports. A variety of new welding technology was introduced, including better electrodes, mechanical “ gravity welding ” machines, one-sided welding (eliminating the need to weld on both sides of a steel plate), and high-speed gas welding.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBulbous bow, via Wikipedia.\nThe shipbuilding methods introduced at Kure also continued to be developed. Shipyards found ways to move outfitting and final assembly work earlier in the process, where it could be done more easily and efficiently: by the 1980s, IHI was installing 80% of a ship’s piping before final assembly. Automatic material handling systems were installed. Process flow lanes were further refined, and fabrication accuracy continued to improve. Parts (and even whole ships) were standardized, reducing design and communication overheads and improving manufacturing efficiency. These and other changes were due to deliberate attempts at continuous improvement, and were often generated by small groups of employees working in “ quality circles.”\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nJapanese shipyards also continued to make large infrastructure investments, in some cases building new shipyards far in areas that had large amounts of available land and ready supplies of labor. New, large drydocks were built, which were superior to the inclined slipways that had previously been used to launch ships. 2 The drydock at Kure which had first enticed National Bulk Carriers could build ships of 150,000 tons, but by the late 1960s Japanese shipyards were building drydocks with over 400,000 deadweight tons ship capacity, along with enormous Goliath gantry cranes capable of lifting 300 tons or more. Heavier cranes allowed for larger blocks and fewer final assembly operations, further reducing construction times. By 1974, seven Japanese shipyards were capable of building 500,000 deadweight ton ships, as many yards as the rest of the world had combined.\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nJapanese shipbuilders also worked to improve their financial performance. Smaller shipbuilders merged into larger ones, and many shipbuilders became diversified industrial conglomerates to insulate themselves somewhat from the notoriously high-variance shipbuilding industry. 3 By the 1970s, for instance, Japanese shipbuilder IHI was manufacturing a range of equipment and heavy machinery, including aircraft engines, nuclear pressure vessels, and plastic molding machinery. Shipyards developed networks of suppliers so parts and materials could be delivered “just in time,” reducing the costs and requirements for holding large amounts of inventory.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSpeed of Japanese shipyards in 1958 vs 1978, via REAPS.\nAs a result, the speed and efficiency of Japanese shipbuilding continued to improve. Between 1958 and 1964, labor-hours per gross ton of Japanese shipyards fell by 60%, and by 1970 had fallen even more. (This efficiency meant that even as Japanese labor costs rose, the labor fraction of the cost of a new ship stayed relatively constant.) Larger ships and more efficient ship designs meant that the amount of steel required per ton of capacity declined by 36% between 1958 and 1964. In the late 1940s it took 10 months to build and launch a cargo ship in Japanese shipyards. By 1970 it took only around 3 months, even though the 1970 ships were 10 times the size. 4\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nWhen Japan passed the UK as the world’s largest commercial shipbuilder in 1956, it was building around 30% of the world’s gross tonnage. By 1970, that fraction had risen to nearly 50%. And as world demand for ships continued to skyrocket in the ‘60s and early ‘70s (accelerated by the Suez Canal closing again in 1967, Japan’s shipbuilding output increased enormously. By 1973, Japan was building over 17 million gross tons of cargo ships a year, nearly as much as the 19 million tons of Liberty Ships the US built over the entire course of WWII.\nAn illustration of just how far Japanese shipbuilders had come came in 1970, when the US instituted the “National Shipbuilding Research Program” (NSRP) in an attempt to improve US shipbuilding efficiency. The main targets of this program were Japanese shipyards, which by the 1970s were building ships more than twice as fast as the US for less than half the cost. Over the next several decades, US shipbuilders would try to learn the Japan shipbuilding techniques that had originated in the US so many years ago. (Ironically, many of the US organizations involved in this effort were behind the pioneering shipbuilding efforts during WWII. The NSRP was spearheaded by the Maritime Administration, the descendant of the US Maritime Commission that orchestrated the construction of thousands of Liberty Ships. And one of the participants was Todd Shipyards, the shipbuilder which partnered with Henry Kaiser and the Six Companies to build and operate the first emergency shipyards for the Maritime Commission during the war.)\nConclusion\nWhat lessons can we learn from Japan’s successful effort to develop a shipbuilding industry?\nOne is that government support was very important. Early on, the Japanese government pumped a lot of money into the industry through things like the Programmed Shipbuilding Scheme and the deal that gave shipbuilders access to low-cost steel, and provided key support in other ways (like arranging for other shipyard engineers to visit NBC’s operations at Kure).\nMore generally, it helped enormously to have major organizations and centers of power working with the revitalization effort, or at least not opposing it. Japanese unions, for instance, weren't organized by craft (welders, boilermakers, etc.), but were “house” unions for each individual shipbuilder (which later organized into one larger umbrella union). This made them more flexible with regards to changing how the work was done. As long as employment wasn’t reduced, the Japanese unions did not oppose the dramatic work rearrangements that the new shipbuilding methods required. In the UK, on the other hand, shipbuilding unions resisted this reorganization, which hamstrung the country’s efforts to modernize its industry.\nAnother lesson is that luck can be a major factor in the arc of industrial development. Japan ultimately benefited enormously from NBC’s Kure operations, which were only set up there because Japanese shipyards had survived the war intact. And Japan benefited from several major tailwinds (the Korean war creating demand for even inefficient shipbuilding, and the Suez Crisis stoking demand for the large tankers Japanese yards had become experts at building). I doubt that these were make or break in whether the industry flourished or not (for one, Japan had many similar industrial successes), but they probably helped it become as dominant as it was.\nAnother important and perhaps underrated factor in industrial success is simply the will to succeed. As I noted in my essay on why the US can’t build ships, the Japanese had a “burning zeal” to make their shipbuilding industry among the best in the world. Shipbuilders in Korea (which succeeded Japan as the world’s biggest shipbuilder) seemed similarly motivated. The US, on the other hand, has never been able to marshal the will to do what it takes to make its industry internationally competitive, and US shipyards often seem to lack motivation to improve. A Japanese shipyard executive engaged to help US shipyards improve their operations noted in the 1980s that the US yards labor hour reduction “did not reach the level that IHI had expected” and that “people who perform production engineering seem rather passive.” You get a similar sense when reading about post-war UK shipbuilding: that it simply lacked the motivation to improve until it was way too late.\nAnd finally, Japan’s shipbuilding efforts show that very high levels of coordination make extremely impressive things possible. The shipbuilding techniques developed in Japan demand a great deal of coordination — between shipowners and designers, between designers and production, between the shipyard and supplier — and the organization needs to be structured to allow such coordination. Hisashi Shinto criticized the US system of having ship design done by outside consultants rather than in-house by the shipyard, describing it as “beyond our comprehension”, and Todd shipyard executives noted that “If the key to Japanese productivity were to be summed up in one word, that word would be \"communication.\"” (One way to get this coordination is vertical integration, but it’s not the only way: Japanese shipyards outsourced a large fraction of their work, and also made heavy use of temporary workers, but were nevertheless able to closely coordinate with their suppliers to get what they need when they need it.)\nI suspect that coordination failures are behind a lot of industrial dysfunction – you can see them at work in naval shipbuilding, for instance, and it’s also part of what makes construction innovation so difficult – and understanding why they occur and how they could be improved might be an underrated avenue for industrial improvement.\n1\n\nSources seem to disagree on this. Wikipedia says Welding Shipyards was built in 1940. t2tanker.org says it began operating in 1938. The Moneymakers claims it wasn’t built until after Pearl Harbor, which would be 1942 at the earliest.\n2\n\nI had a hard time figuring out exactly why drydocks are superior to slipways. Part of it seems to be that launching a ship by sliding it down a slipway causes stresses on the ship and can potentially damage it, and safely launching very large ships essentially requires floating them with a drydock rather than sliding down a slipway. But it’s also implied that there are other efficiencies (possibly related to the sloped surface of the slipway adding complexity) that I had trouble pinning down.\n3\n\nShipbuilding is high-variance in part due to the “accelerator effect” — a small change in output for a final good can result in a large change in the demand for the long-lifetime equipment used to produce that good. So small changes in global trade volumes can have large changes on the demand for new ships.\n4\n\nInterestingly, Japan wasn’t necessarily the most productive shipbuilder in the world in terms of labor efficiency. By 1981 Sweden was at the top, Japan was only 4th.",

Amazon recently announced a robot system with what looks like impressive dexterity capabilities, though it&#8217;s not a humanoid robot nor does it use human-like hands. Vulcan is an Amazon robot that uses touch sensors (along with computer vision) to stow and retrieve objects from storage pallets. Via <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-vulcan-robot-pick-stow-touch\">AboutAmazon</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>In our fulfillment centers, we maximize efficiency by storing inventory in fabric-covered pods that are divided into compartments about a foot square, each of which holds up to 10 items on average. Fitting an item into or plucking one out of this crowded space has historically been challenging for robots that lack the natural dexterity of humans.</em></p><p><em>Vulcan is our first robot with a similar kind of finesse. Vulcan can easily manipulate objects within those compartments to make room for whatever it&#8217;s stowing, because it knows when it makes contact and how much force it&#8217;s applying and can stop short of doing any damage.</em></p><p><em>Vulcan does this using an &#8220;end of arm tooling&#8221; that resembles a ruler stuck onto a hair straightener, plus force feedback sensors that tell it how hard it&#8217;s pushing or how firmly it&#8217;s holding something, so it can stay below the point at which it risks doing damage.</em></p><p><em>The ruler bit pushes around the items already in those compartments to make room for whatever it wants to add. The arms of the hair straightener (the &#8220;paddles&#8221;) hold the item to be added, adjusting their grip strength based on the item&#8217;s size and shape, then use built-in conveyor belts to zhoop the item into the bin.</em></p><p><em>For picking items from those bins, Vulcan uses an arm that carries a camera and a suction cup. The camera looks at the compartment and picks out the item to be grabbed, along with the best spot to hold it by. While the suction cup grabs it, the camera watches to make sure it took the right thing and only the right thing, avoiding what our engineers call the risk of &#8220;co-extracting non-target items.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:506,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fsG5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f66bec7-fdd7-488e-9101-d604551c9a4a_900x506.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Vulcan stowing robot</figcaption></figure></div><p>IEEE has a bit more detail about Vulcan&#8217;s <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-stowing-robots\">stowing ability here</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-robotics-vulcan-warehouse-picking\">picking ability here</a>.

From <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/air-traffic-control-fix-problems-2bffc11c\">the Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>At about 1:30 in the afternoon on April 28, air-traffic controllers overseeing the busy airspace around Newark Liberty International Airport suddenly faced a frightening scenario.</em></p><p><em>The chatter from pilots they were communicating with went silent. Radar screens filled with dots showing aircraft positions went dark. Backup systems failed. Planes bound for the area went into holding patterns.</em></p><p><em>About 90 seconds later, the traffic-control systems started blinking back to life. But problems lingered with the radar, and controllers worried the radios would go out again&#8230;</em></p><p><em>There were no crashes, but scores of flights coming and going were delayed for hours, and dozens scheduled to arrive in Newark were diverted to other airports&#8230;</em></p><p><em>America&#8217;s air-traffic control system has been troubled for years, the culmination of years of anemic funding, archaic technology and staffing problems. A wake-up call sounded on Jan. 29 with a midair collision near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have pledged to overhaul the system.</em></p><p><em>The Government Accountability Office said last year that about three-quarters of the FAA&#8217;s 138 air-traffic systems were either obsolete or potentially too difficult to reliably maintain. Duffy said he is preparing to unveil a plan this week to upgrade the FAA&#8217;s network of facilities, radars and other technology, which industry and government officials believe could cost $20 billion to $40 billion.</em></p></blockquote><p>Part of the problem seems to be a shortage of air traffic controllers, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/newark-airport-delays.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">New York Times notes</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The nation&#8217;s air traffic control system has been plagued by years of dysfunction. The controller ranks were depleted by retirements and a cessation in training during the pandemic. Since then, recruiting and certifying new controllers has been difficult. Existing controllers have been fatigued and even sickened by intense stress and long hours, The New York Times has reported. Some have avoided seeking medical attention because doing so could jeopardize the health care clearances they need to do the work. Turnover is frequent, especially amid illnesses, family turmoil or safety scares.</em></p></blockquote><p>This shortage was probably exacerbated by an <a href=\"https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring\">extremely misguided attempt by the FAA</a> to change its hiring policies to increase the diversity of aircraft controllers.</p><h5>Magnetohydrodynamic ship propulsion</h5><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_for_Red_October_(film)\">The Hunt for Red October</a> is a movie, based on a Tom Clancy book, where a Russian sub commander tries to defect while operating a new sub with a nearly silent &#8220;magnetohydrodynamic&#8221; (MHD) engine with no moving parts. Apparently this engine is based on a real idea. The a post at <a href=\"https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog/magnetohydrodynamic-drives\">K&amp;J Magnetics</a> explains how a MHD ship drive works:</p><blockquote><p><em>Salty water conducts electricity. Imagine a drive tube with two conductive plates secured on opposite sides of the tube. With one grounded and the other connected to a voltage, a current flows through the water across the gap.</em></p><p><em>The resistance of the water changes depending on how much salt is dissolved in it. The more salt, the more current you'll get. Since submarines operate in the ocean, we'll assume the operating fluid is seawater, roughly 3.5% salt by weight.</em></p><p><em>Next, we'll place two magnets sandwiching the tube, top and bottom. Now the water within sees vertical magnetic field.</em></p><p><em>Finally, let's consider the Lorentz force. Consider what's happening to a tiny little bit of conductive water within that tube. The right hand rule says that, with a current flowing in one direction, and a magnetic field runs in a direction perpendicular to that electric flow, then the bit of water will feel a force that's perpendicular to both of those directions.</em></p><p><em>Whew, that's a mouthful. Let's express that graphically with the right-hand rule. If the current runs in the direction of the thumb, and the magnetic field with the index finger, the force is down the middle finger.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png\" width=\"464\" height=\"344.8983957219251\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:695,&quot;width&quot;:935,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:464,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>An experimental ship using a MHD drive was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_1\">built in Japan in the 1990s</a>, but the technology never apparently progressed after that.

The answer is twofold. First, the electromagnetic coils need to be extremely powerful and making ones that are light enough and efficient enough to install in a submarine isn't easy. The second is that the electrodes must stand up to a lot of wear due to corrosion, hydrolysis, and erosion caused by the interaction of the magnetic fields, electrical current, and saltwater&#8230;</em></p><p><em>\"The best efficiency demonstrated in a magnetohydrodynamic drive to date was 1992 on the Yamato-1, a 30-m (100-ft) vessel that achieved 6.6 knots with an efficiency of around 30% using a magnetic field strength of approximately 4 Tesla,\" said Susan Swithenbank, PUMP program manager in DARPA&#8217;s Defense Sciences Office. &#8220;In the last couple years, the commercial fusion industry has made advances in Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) magnets that have demonstrated large-scale magnetic fields as high as 20 Tesla that could potentially yield 90% efficiency in a magnetohydrodynamic drive, which is worth pursuing.

For those who want to read more about the subject, here’s a list of some of the best references I found.\n\nShips for Victory by Frederic Lane- A very thorough 800+ page history of Maritime Commission shipbuilding during WWII. By far the most useful source on understanding the Maritime Commission shipbuilding program, though it’s a dense and dry read. Most other sources ultimately reference this one.\n\nLaunching a Thousand Ships by Chris Tassava- This is a 2003 phD thesis on US WWII shipbuilding. Covers a lot of the same ground as Lane’s book (and references it heavily), but it has much more of a focus on the actual shipbuilding methods used, and Henry Kaiser, operator of the largest and most efficient shipyards. For learning about Maritime Commission shipbuilding, this and Lane together are almost all you need.\n\nFreedom’s Forge by Arthur Herman- The very popular history of US WWII mobilization that emphasizes the role of businessmen like Bill Knudsen, Henry Kaiser, and Henry Ford. It’s a good and useful source, and probably the only book here of interest to the general reader, but it gives a very narrow perspective on the subject. So for shipbuilding there’s lots of coverage of Kaiser, but virtually no mention of other builders like Bethlehem, even though Bethlehem built a large chunk of both Maritime Commission ships and ships for the Navy. Recommended reading in concert with other sources that give a broader view.\n\nHistorical American Engineering Record Report on Richmond Shipyards- Exactly what it says on the tin, a historical report from HAER on the Kaiser Richmond shipyards. This had a lot of interesting detail on the background of WWII shipbuilding (including its WWI prehistory) and the Kaiser yards themselves that other sources didn’t.\n\nCalship Liberty Ship Manual- This is an interesting book produced by Calship in 1942 that details the layout of the yard and the exact procedure used to build a Liberty Ship, complete with pictures of the various processes and prefabricated sections.\nAmazon’s Vulcan robot\nI noted in my essay about humanoid robots that dexterity — the ability to flexibly manipulate a variety of objects quickly and precisely — is still difficult for robots, but that it seems to be improving. Amazon recently announced a robot system with what looks like impressive dexterity capabilities, though it’s not a humanoid robot nor does it use human-like hands. Vulcan is an Amazon robot that uses touch sensors (along with computer vision) to stow and retrieve objects from storage pallets. Via AboutAmazon:\n\nIn our fulfillment centers, we maximize efficiency by storing inventory in fabric-covered pods that are divided into compartments about a foot square, each of which holds up to 10 items on average. Fitting an item into or plucking one out of this crowded space has historically been challenging for robots that lack the natural dexterity of humans.\nVulcan is our first robot with a similar kind of finesse. Vulcan can easily manipulate objects within those compartments to make room for whatever it’s stowing, because it knows when it makes contact and how much force it’s applying and can stop short of doing any damage.\nVulcan does this using an “end of arm tooling” that resembles a ruler stuck onto a hair straightener, plus force feedback sensors that tell it how hard it’s pushing or how firmly it’s holding something, so it can stay below the point at which it risks doing damage.\nThe ruler bit pushes around the items already in those compartments to make room for whatever it wants to add. The arms of the hair straightener (the “paddles”) hold the item to be added, adjusting their grip strength based on the item’s size and shape, then use built-in conveyor belts to zhoop the item into the bin.\nFor picking items from those bins, Vulcan uses an arm that carries a camera and a suction cup. The camera looks at the compartment and picks out the item to be grabbed, along with the best spot to hold it by. While the suction cup grabs it, the camera watches to make sure it took the right thing and only the right thing, avoiding what our engineers call the risk of “co-extracting non-target items.”\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nVulcan stowing robot\nIEEE has a bit more detail about Vulcan’s stowing ability here, and picking ability here. A nice (short) video of the system in operation here.\nAir traffic control\nRecent problems at Newark Liberty Airport ( 12th busiest US airport by passenger volume) have highlighted major problems in the nation’s air traffic control system (not a sentence you ever want to have to write). From the Wall Street Journal:\n\nAt about 1:30 in the afternoon on April 28, air-traffic controllers overseeing the busy airspace around Newark Liberty International Airport suddenly faced a frightening scenario.\nThe chatter from pilots they were communicating with went silent. Radar screens filled with dots showing aircraft positions went dark. Backup systems failed. Planes bound for the area went into holding patterns.\nAbout 90 seconds later, the traffic-control systems started blinking back to life. But problems lingered with the radar, and controllers worried the radios would go out again…\nThere were no crashes, but scores of flights coming and going were delayed for hours, and dozens scheduled to arrive in Newark were diverted to other airports…\nAmerica’s air-traffic control system has been troubled for years, the culmination of years of anemic funding, archaic technology and staffing problems. A wake-up call sounded on Jan. 29 with a midair collision near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have pledged to overhaul the system.\nThe Government Accountability Office said last year that about three-quarters of the FAA’s 138 air-traffic systems were either obsolete or potentially too difficult to reliably maintain. Duffy said he is preparing to unveil a plan this week to upgrade the FAA’s network of facilities, radars and other technology, which industry and government officials believe could cost $20 billion to $40 billion.\nPart of the problem seems to be a shortage of air traffic controllers, as the New York Times notes:\n\nThe nation’s air traffic control system has been plagued by years of dysfunction. The controller ranks were depleted by retirements and a cessation in training during the pandemic. Since then, recruiting and certifying new controllers has been difficult. Existing controllers have been fatigued and even sickened by intense stress and long hours, The New York Times has reported. Some have avoided seeking medical attention because doing so could jeopardize the health care clearances they need to do the work. Turnover is frequent, especially amid illnesses, family turmoil or safety scares.\nThis shortage was probably exacerbated by an extremely misguided attempt by the FAA to change its hiring policies to increase the diversity of aircraft controllers.\nMagnetohydrodynamic ship propulsion\nThe Hunt for Red October is a movie, based on a Tom Clancy book, where a Russian sub commander tries to defect while operating a new sub with a nearly silent “magnetohydrodynamic” (MHD) engine with no moving parts. Apparently this engine is based on a real idea. The a post at K&J Magnetics explains how a MHD ship drive works:\n\nSalty water conducts electricity. Imagine a drive tube with two conductive plates secured on opposite sides of the tube. With one grounded and the other connected to a voltage, a current flows through the water across the gap.\nThe resistance of the water changes depending on how much salt is dissolved in it. The more salt, the more current you'll get. Since submarines operate in the ocean, we'll assume the operating fluid is seawater, roughly 3.5% salt by weight.\nNext, we'll place two magnets sandwiching the tube, top and bottom. Now the water within sees vertical magnetic field.\nFinally, let's consider the Lorentz force. Consider what's happening to a tiny little bit of conductive water within that tube. The right hand rule says that, with a current flowing in one direction, and a magnetic field runs in a direction perpendicular to that electric flow, then the bit of water will feel a force that's perpendicular to both of those directions.\nWhew, that's a mouthful. Let's express that graphically with the right-hand rule. If the current runs in the direction of the thumb, and the magnetic field with the index finger, the force is down the middle finger.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAn experimental ship using a MHD drive was built in Japan in the 1990s, but the technology never apparently progressed after that. But apparently since 2023 DARPA has been working on a MHD program, enabled in part by advances in magnets from commercial fusion companies. Via New Atlas:\n\n…if this technology is so valuable, why hasn't it been used for over 60 years except in a couple of experimental surface boats? The answer is twofold. First, the electromagnetic coils need to be extremely powerful and making ones that are light enough and efficient enough to install in a submarine isn't easy. The second is that the electrodes must stand up to a lot of wear due to corrosion, hydrolysis, and erosion caused by the interaction of the magnetic fields, electrical current, and saltwater…\n\"The best efficiency demonstrated in a magnetohydrodynamic drive to date was 1992 on the Yamato-1, a 30-m (100-ft) vessel that achieved 6.6 knots with an efficiency of around 30% using a magnetic field strength of approximately 4 Tesla,\" said Susan Swithenbank, PUMP program manager in DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office. “In the last couple years, the commercial fusion industry has made advances in Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) magnets that have demonstrated large-scale magnetic fields as high as 20 Tesla that could potentially yield 90% efficiency in a magnetohydrodynamic drive, which is worth pursuing. Now that the glass ceiling in high magnetic field generation has been broken, PUMP aims to achieve a breakthrough to solve the electrode materials challenge.\"\nRead more",

From <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/air-traffic-control-fix-problems-2bffc11c\">the Wall Street Journal</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>At about 1:30 in the afternoon on April 28, air-traffic controllers overseeing the busy airspace around Newark Liberty International Airport suddenly faced a frightening scenario.</em></p><p><em>The chatter from pilots they were communicating with went silent. Radar screens filled with dots showing aircraft positions went dark. Backup systems failed.

But problems lingered with the radar, and controllers worried the radios would go out again&#8230;</em></p><p><em>There were no crashes, but scores of flights coming and going were delayed for hours, and dozens scheduled to arrive in Newark were diverted to other airports&#8230;</em></p><p><em>America&#8217;s air-traffic control system has been troubled for years, the culmination of years of anemic funding, archaic technology and staffing problems. A wake-up call sounded on Jan. 29 with a midair collision near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have pledged to overhaul the system.</em></p><p><em>The Government Accountability Office said last year that about three-quarters of the FAA&#8217;s 138 air-traffic systems were either obsolete or potentially too difficult to reliably maintain. Duffy said he is preparing to unveil a plan this week to upgrade the FAA&#8217;s network of facilities, radars and other technology, which industry and government officials believe could cost $20 billion to $40 billion.</em></p></blockquote><p>Part of the problem seems to be a shortage of air traffic controllers, as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/us/politics/newark-airport-delays.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">New York Times notes</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The nation&#8217;s air traffic control system has been plagued by years of dysfunction. The controller ranks were depleted by retirements and a cessation in training during the pandemic. Since then, recruiting and certifying new controllers has been difficult. Existing controllers have been fatigued and even sickened by intense stress and long hours, The New York Times has reported. Some have avoided seeking medical attention because doing so could jeopardize the health care clearances they need to do the work. Turnover is frequent, especially amid illnesses, family turmoil or safety scares.</em></p></blockquote><p>This shortage was probably exacerbated by an <a href=\"https://www.tracingwoodgrains.com/p/the-full-story-of-the-faas-hiring\">extremely misguided attempt by the FAA</a> to change its hiring policies to increase the diversity of aircraft controllers.</p><h5>Magnetohydrodynamic ship propulsion</h5><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_for_Red_October_(film)\">The Hunt for Red October</a> is a movie, based on a Tom Clancy book, where a Russian sub commander tries to defect while operating a new sub with a nearly silent &#8220;magnetohydrodynamic&#8221; (MHD) engine with no moving parts. Apparently this engine is based on a real idea. The a post at <a href=\"https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog/magnetohydrodynamic-drives\">K&amp;J Magnetics</a> explains how a MHD ship drive works:</p><blockquote><p><em>Salty water conducts electricity. Imagine a drive tube with two conductive plates secured on opposite sides of the tube. With one grounded and the other connected to a voltage, a current flows through the water across the gap.</em></p><p><em>The resistance of the water changes depending on how much salt is dissolved in it. The more salt, the more current you'll get. Since submarines operate in the ocean, we'll assume the operating fluid is seawater, roughly 3.5% salt by weight.</em></p><p><em>Next, we'll place two magnets sandwiching the tube, top and bottom. Now the water within sees vertical magnetic field.</em></p><p><em>Finally, let's consider the Lorentz force. Consider what's happening to a tiny little bit of conductive water within that tube. The right hand rule says that, with a current flowing in one direction, and a magnetic field runs in a direction perpendicular to that electric flow, then the bit of water will feel a force that's perpendicular to both of those directions.</em></p><p><em>Whew, that's a mouthful. Let's express that graphically with the right-hand rule. If the current runs in the direction of the thumb, and the magnetic field with the index finger, the force is down the middle finger.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png\" width=\"464\" height=\"344.8983957219251\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:695,&quot;width&quot;:935,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:464,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!cvKx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06e1a76a-e156-4d3c-9bd9-02314d1c1949_935x695.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>An experimental ship using a MHD drive was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_1\">built in Japan in the 1990s</a>, but the technology never apparently progressed after that.

The answer is twofold. First, the electromagnetic coils need to be extremely powerful and making ones that are light enough and efficient enough to install in a submarine isn't easy.

This week we look at Amazon’s Vulcan robot, magnetohydrodynamic ship propulsion, Waymo’s manufacturing scale up, Boom Supersonic’s new super alloy, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nInspired by one of my favorite Twitter threads of all time, I started a new Twitter account dedicated to sharing pictures of “Infrastructure that looks like Sci Fi”. You can follow it here.\nShipbuilding reading list\nThis week’s newsletter was about US shipbuilding during WWII. For those who want to read more about the subject, here’s a list of some of the best references I found.\n\nShips for Victory by Frederic Lane- A very thorough 800+ page history of Maritime Commission shipbuilding during WWII. By far the most useful source on understanding the Maritime Commission shipbuilding program, though it’s a dense and dry read. Most other sources ultimately reference this one.\n\nLaunching a Thousand Ships by Chris Tassava- This is a 2003 phD thesis on US WWII shipbuilding. Covers a lot of the same ground as Lane’s book (and references it heavily), but it has much more of a focus on the actual shipbuilding methods used, and Henry Kaiser, operator of the largest and most efficient shipyards. For learning about Maritime Commission shipbuilding, this and Lane together are almost all you need.\n\nFreedom’s Forge by Arthur Herman- The very popular history of US WWII mobilization that emphasizes the role of businessmen like Bill Knudsen, Henry Kaiser, and Henry Ford. It’s a good and useful source, and probably the only book here of interest to the general reader, but it gives a very narrow perspective on the subject. So for shipbuilding there’s lots of coverage of Kaiser, but virtually no mention of other builders like Bethlehem, even though Bethlehem built a large chunk of both Maritime Commission ships and ships for the Navy. Recommended reading in concert with other sources that give a broader view.\n\nHistorical American Engineering Record Report on Richmond Shipyards- Exactly what it says on the tin, a historical report from HAER on the Kaiser Richmond shipyards. This had a lot of interesting detail on the background of WWII shipbuilding (including its WWI prehistory) and the Kaiser yards themselves that other sources didn’t.\n\nCalship Liberty Ship Manual- This is an interesting book produced by Calship in 1942 that details the layout of the yard and the exact procedure used to build a Liberty Ship, complete with pictures of the various processes and prefabricated sections.\nAmazon’s Vulcan robot\nI noted in my essay about humanoid robots that dexterity — the ability to flexibly manipulate a variety of objects quickly and precisely — is still difficult for robots, but that it seems to be improving. Amazon recently announced a robot system with what looks like impressive dexterity capabilities, though it’s not a humanoid robot nor does it use human-like hands. Vulcan is an Amazon robot that uses touch sensors (along with computer vision) to stow and retrieve objects from storage pallets. Via AboutAmazon:\n\nIn our fulfillment centers, we maximize efficiency by storing inventory in fabric-covered pods that are divided into compartments about a foot square, each of which holds up to 10 items on average. Fitting an item into or plucking one out of this crowded space has historically been challenging for robots that lack the natural dexterity of humans.\nVulcan is our first robot with a similar kind of finesse. Vulcan can easily manipulate objects within those compartments to make room for whatever it’s stowing, because it knows when it makes contact and how much force it’s applying and can stop short of doing any damage.\nVulcan does this using an “end of arm tooling” that resembles a ruler stuck onto a hair straightener, plus force feedback sensors that tell it how hard it’s pushing or how firmly it’s holding something, so it can stay below the point at which it risks doing damage.\nThe ruler bit pushes around the items already in those compartments to make room for whatever it wants to add. The arms of the hair straightener (the “paddles”) hold the item to be added, adjusting their grip strength based on the item’s size and shape, then use built-in conveyor belts to zhoop the item into the bin.\nFor picking items from those bins, Vulcan uses an arm that carries a camera and a suction cup. The camera looks at the compartment and picks out the item to be grabbed, along with the best spot to hold it by. While the suction cup grabs it, the camera watches to make sure it took the right thing and only the right thing, avoiding what our engineers call the risk of “co-extracting non-target items.”\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nVulcan stowing robot\nIEEE has a bit more detail about Vulcan’s stowing ability here, and picking ability here. A nice (short) video of the system in operation here.\nAir traffic control\nRecent problems at Newark Liberty Airport ( 12th busiest US airport by passenger volume) have highlighted major problems in the nation’s air traffic control system (not a sentence you ever want to have to write).

A wake-up call sounded on Jan. 29 with a midair collision near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people. President Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have pledged to overhaul the system.\nThe Government Accountability Office said last year that about three-quarters of the FAA’s 138 air-traffic systems were either obsolete or potentially too difficult to reliably maintain. Duffy said he is preparing to unveil a plan this week to upgrade the FAA’s network of facilities, radars and other technology, which industry and government officials believe could cost $20 billion to $40 billion.\nPart of the problem seems to be a shortage of air traffic controllers, as the New York Times notes:\n\nThe nation’s air traffic control system has been plagued by years of dysfunction. The controller ranks were depleted by retirements and a cessation in training during the pandemic. Since then, recruiting and certifying new controllers has been difficult. Existing controllers have been fatigued and even sickened by intense stress and long hours, The New York Times has reported. Some have avoided seeking medical attention because doing so could jeopardize the health care clearances they need to do the work. Turnover is frequent, especially amid illnesses, family turmoil or safety scares.\nThis shortage was probably exacerbated by an extremely misguided attempt by the FAA to change its hiring policies to increase the diversity of aircraft controllers.\nMagnetohydrodynamic ship propulsion\nThe Hunt for Red October is a movie, based on a Tom Clancy book, where a Russian sub commander tries to defect while operating a new sub with a nearly silent “magnetohydrodynamic” (MHD) engine with no moving parts. Apparently this engine is based on a real idea. The a post at K&J Magnetics explains how a MHD ship drive works:\n\nSalty water conducts electricity. Imagine a drive tube with two conductive plates secured on opposite sides of the tube. With one grounded and the other connected to a voltage, a current flows through the water across the gap.\nThe resistance of the water changes depending on how much salt is dissolved in it. The more salt, the more current you'll get. Since submarines operate in the ocean, we'll assume the operating fluid is seawater, roughly 3.5% salt by weight.\nNext, we'll place two magnets sandwiching the tube, top and bottom. Now the water within sees vertical magnetic field.\nFinally, let's consider the Lorentz force. Consider what's happening to a tiny little bit of conductive water within that tube. The right hand rule says that, with a current flowing in one direction, and a magnetic field runs in a direction perpendicular to that electric flow, then the bit of water will feel a force that's perpendicular to both of those directions.\nWhew, that's a mouthful. Let's express that graphically with the right-hand rule. If the current runs in the direction of the thumb, and the magnetic field with the index finger, the force is down the middle finger.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAn experimental ship using a MHD drive was built in Japan in the 1990s, but the technology never apparently progressed after that. But apparently since 2023 DARPA has been working on a MHD program, enabled in part by advances in magnets from commercial fusion companies. Via New Atlas:\n\n…if this technology is so valuable, why hasn't it been used for over 60 years except in a couple of experimental surface boats? The answer is twofold. First, the electromagnetic coils need to be extremely powerful and making ones that are light enough and efficient enough to install in a submarine isn't easy. The second is that the electrodes must stand up to a lot of wear due to corrosion, hydrolysis, and erosion caused by the interaction of the magnetic fields, electrical current, and saltwater…\n\"The best efficiency demonstrated in a magnetohydrodynamic drive to date was 1992 on the Yamato-1, a 30-m (100-ft) vessel that achieved 6.6 knots with an efficiency of around 30% using a magnetic field strength of approximately 4 Tesla,\" said Susan Swithenbank, PUMP program manager in DARPA’s Defense Sciences Office. “In the last couple years, the commercial fusion industry has made advances in Rare-Earth Barium Copper Oxide (REBCO) magnets that have demonstrated large-scale magnetic fields as high as 20 Tesla that could potentially yield 90% efficiency in a magnetohydrodynamic drive, which is worth pursuing. Now that the glass ceiling in high magnetic field generation has been broken, PUMP aims to achieve a breakthrough to solve the electrode materials challenge.\"\nRead more",

From the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e922cda3-801d-40df-8455-5d3aeae34288\">Financial Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Spain and Portugal on Monday were hit by a complete power outage, leaving trains stranded in tunnels, office workers stuck in lifts and mobile phone services cut, in the biggest blackout in Europe for two decades&#8230;</em></p><p><em>At 12.33pm local time on Monday, the frequency on Spain&#8217;s electricity grid suddenly dropped, from the 50 hertz level at which the grid&#8217;s operator tries to maintain it, to 49 hertz, according to Aurora Energy Research, a consultancy.</em></p><p><em>A move bigger than 0.1 hertz forces many power stations to automatically switch off for safety reasons. Any loss of power in Spain has an immediate knock-on effect in Portugal, which relies heavily on its neighbour for electricity supplies.</em></p><p><em>What triggered the frequency to fall in the first instance is not yet clear. On Tuesday, Eduardo Prieto, director of operational services at Spain&#8217;s grid operator Red El&#233;ctrica, blamed an unexpected loss of generation in south-west Spain, home to a lot of solar plants. Other theories include electricity cable damage.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c175ykvjxyeo\">BBC</a> has a nice graphic showing the sudden decline and resumption in power demand.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"420.41015625\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:861,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:500,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7Q0f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2155ec44-0cb9-45b9-a1a2-5809b4768c5c_1024x861.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Much of the blame is being placed on excessive use of solar energy, which (by default) doesn&#8217;t have the grid-stabilizing effects that power sources which use large, rotating masses (such as anything with an electric generator) do.

It has now moved to focus on medium- to heavy-lift rockets with a higher payload capacity. Some of these companies focus on building cheaper, reusable rockets to launch commercial payloads &#8212; usually satellites &#8212; into space for a fraction of the cost of legacy manufacturers that use pricier, disposable rockets&#8230;</em></p><p><em>In recent years, Relativity Space has run into challenges.

The start-up has moved away from focusing entirely on 3-D printed materials and has begun incorporating more traditionally made parts in building its rockets.</em></p></blockquote><p>At the time it wasn&#8217;t amazingly obvious what was motivating Schmidt.

It&#8217;s still perhaps underappreciated the degree to which China is no longer just a source of cheap labor, and that their manufacturing processes are highly advanced and automated (increasingly with Chinese-built robots and automation). Robots are being used not just in large-scale operations but in small companies with just a few employees:</p><blockquote><p><em>Elon Li&#8217;s curbside workshop in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China, has 11 workers who cut and weld metal to make inexpensive ovens and barbecue equipment. He is now preparing to pay $40,000 to a Chinese company for a robotic arm with a camera. The device uses artificial intelligence to observe how a worker welds the sides of an oven, and then duplicates the action with minimal human intervention.</em></p><p><em>Only four years ago, the same system was available only from foreign robot companies and cost nearly $140,000. &#8220;Before, I never would have imagined investing in automation,&#8221; Mr. Li said, adding that a human employee &#8220;can only work for eight hours a day, but a machine can work 24 hours.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>&#8230;In Ningbo, a huge factory for Zeekr, a Chinese electric carmaker, had 500 robots when it opened four years ago. Now there are 820, and many more are planned.</em></p><p><em>Cheerfully trilling Kenny G tunes to warn any people of their approach, robot carts haul aluminum ingots to an automated elevator, which lifts the blocks of metal to a furnace at the top of a 40-foot-tall Chinese-made machine. Once molten, the aluminum is cast into the shapes of various car body panels and other components. More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse.</em></p><p><em>&#8230;Car factories in the United States also use automation, but much of the equipment comes from China. Most of the world&#8217;s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them.</em></p><p><em>Chinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, like Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had only one robot from Germany and 1,074 robots made in Shanghai.</em></p></blockquote>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-050325\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

      "script_text": "Image: Image\n\n\n\nAerial image of Cairo\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure and industrial technology. This week we look at the blackout in Spain and Portugal, Chinese robot adoption, energy maneuverability theory, the Florida real estate market, battery manufacturing cancellations, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nNo essay this week, but I’m working on a longer piece about WWII shipbuilding that will be out next week.\nOne other item of note, I was on Packy McCormick’s podcast Hyperlegible last week.\nSpain and Portugal blackout\nOn Monday a huge power occurred in Spain and Portugal, with much of the countries without power for hours. From the Financial Times:\n\nSpain and Portugal on Monday were hit by a complete power outage, leaving trains stranded in tunnels, office workers stuck in lifts and mobile phone services cut, in the biggest blackout in Europe for two decades…\nAt 12.33pm local time on Monday, the frequency on Spain’s electricity grid suddenly dropped, from the 50 hertz level at which the grid’s operator tries to maintain it, to 49 hertz, according to Aurora Energy Research, a consultancy.\nA move bigger than 0.1 hertz forces many power stations to automatically switch off for safety reasons. Any loss of power in Spain has an immediate knock-on effect in Portugal, which relies heavily on its neighbour for electricity supplies.\nWhat triggered the frequency to fall in the first instance is not yet clear. On Tuesday, Eduardo Prieto, director of operational services at Spain’s grid operator Red Eléctrica, blamed an unexpected loss of generation in south-west Spain, home to a lot of solar plants. Other theories include electricity cable damage.\nBBC has a nice graphic showing the sudden decline and resumption in power demand.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the blame is being placed on excessive use of solar energy, which (by default) doesn’t have the grid-stabilizing effects that power sources which use large, rotating masses (such as anything with an electric generator) do. From another Financial Times article:\n\nSpanish grid operator Red Eléctrica has said that it still does not know the exact cause of the outage. Chief executive Beatriz Corredor denied that renewables “made the system more vulnerable” in an interview with El País on Wednesday.\nBut André Merlin, the founder and former chief executive of France’s grid operator RTE, told the Financial Times: “Two-thirds of [Spain’s electricity] production was made up of non-controllable resources. These non-controllable resources . . . don’t contribute to the stability of the internal electrical system.”\nOn Twitter Mark Nelson shared a nice graphic illustrating the importance of inertia to stabilize the grid.\n\nSmall or medium-sized disturbances on the grid become very difficult to manage and can cascade into wider instability and outages when the grid is in a low inertia condition, as was the case Monday in Spain just before the massive ongoing blackout\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nBut batteries can also act as frequency stabilizers, and apparently Spain makes it somewhat difficult to use batteries to stabilize the electrical grid. From Austin Vernon on Twitter:\n\nFun fact: 1 megawatt of batteries provides the same amount of frequency regulation as 10 megawatts of spinning generation.\nAnother fun fact: Spain has been slow to change the rules that allow batteries to participate in frequency regulation markets.\nDon't be like Spain!\nEric Schmidt on space-based data centers\nSeveral weeks ago we noted that Eric Schmidt had recently become CEO of struggling rocket startup Relativity Space:\n\nRelativity Space started as one of a crop of start-ups angling to manufacture rockets that can carry smaller payloads of around two tons or less, up to low to medium Earth orbit. It has now moved to focus on medium- to heavy-lift rockets with a higher payload capacity. Some of these companies focus on building cheaper, reusable rockets to launch commercial payloads — usually satellites — into space for a fraction of the cost of legacy manufacturers that use pricier, disposable rockets…\nIn recent years, Relativity Space has run into challenges. It launched its small Terran 1 rocket once, in 2023, and it failed soon after liftoff. A month later, Relativity Space announced it would retire Terran 1 to focus on the Terran R, a larger rocket that would compete with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. The start-up has moved away from focusing entirely on 3-D printed materials and has begun incorporating more traditionally made parts in building its rockets.\nAt the time it wasn’t amazingly obvious what was motivating Schmidt. But apparently one reason is that Schmidt sees space-based data centers as a way to resolve the data center power problem.

Our research indicates that Microsoft is freezing 1.5GW of near term self-build datacenter projects – projects that were previously scheduled to go online in 2025 and 2026.\nMicrosoft is freezing multiple (but not all) self-build projects across the globe with an immediate impact on capacity for 2025 and 2026 – as highlighted earlier to our Datacenter Model clients. Numerous multi-hundred-MW Microsoft campuses have shown underwhelming progress, despite our research indicating that these projects have secured energy and all necessary approvals. This is a deliberate move by Microsoft to slow the expansion of its self-built capacity.\nIn other data center news, Meta is upping its data center spend for this year.\nChinese robotics investment\nThe New York Times has a good piece about robot adoption in China. It’s still perhaps underappreciated the degree to which China is no longer just a source of cheap labor, and that their manufacturing processes are highly advanced and automated (increasingly with Chinese-built robots and automation). Robots are being used not just in large-scale operations but in small companies with just a few employees:\n\nElon Li’s curbside workshop in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China, has 11 workers who cut and weld metal to make inexpensive ovens and barbecue equipment. He is now preparing to pay $40,000 to a Chinese company for a robotic arm with a camera. The device uses artificial intelligence to observe how a worker welds the sides of an oven, and then duplicates the action with minimal human intervention.\nOnly four years ago, the same system was available only from foreign robot companies and cost nearly $140,000. “Before, I never would have imagined investing in automation,” Mr. Li said, adding that a human employee “can only work for eight hours a day, but a machine can work 24 hours.”\n…In Ningbo, a huge factory for Zeekr, a Chinese electric carmaker, had 500 robots when it opened four years ago. Now there are 820, and many more are planned.\nCheerfully trilling Kenny G tunes to warn any people of their approach, robot carts haul aluminum ingots to an automated elevator, which lifts the blocks of metal to a furnace at the top of a 40-foot-tall Chinese-made machine. Once molten, the aluminum is cast into the shapes of various car body panels and other components. More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse.\n…Car factories in the United States also use automation, but much of the equipment comes from China. Most of the world’s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them.\nChinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, like Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had only one robot from Germany and 1,074 robots made in Shanghai.\nRead more",

This week we look at enhanced rock weathering, driverless trucks, Home Depot&#8217;s garden experiments, hydrogen airplanes, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><h5>Enhanced rock weathering</h5><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering\">Enhanced rock weathering</a> is a proposed method of removing CO2 from the air by breaking up large volumes of rock into small particles, and letting carbon dioxide in the air react with those particles to form carbonate minerals. It&#8217;s attractive as a method of carbon sequestration because it could potentially remove very large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere relatively cheaply. Austin Vernon <a href=\"https://austinvernon.site/blog/rockweathering.html\">crunches the numbers on it</a><em>, </em>and finds while the most optimistic projections of $10 per ton of carbon removed aren&#8217;t doable, it still seems promising:</p><blockquote><p><em>Overall, achieving an undiscounted cost of CO2 removal that is less than $100/ton at the billions or even trillions of tons scale seems doable. And while the market might not support that scale of effort, there is a profound impact on policy. Most environmental subsidies cost more than $100/ton of CO2. For example, assume an existing natural gas power plant costs $40/MWh to run and emits 0.4 tons CO2/MWh. Replacement generation that costs $100/MWh would have an abatement cost of $150/ton of CO2. Targeted subsidies for specific technologies look even worse compared to blanket carbon taxes/removals than they did before. $1 billion would buy a fully-scaled first site to prove that globally relevant weathering amounts are viable. Field studies to verify a location and rock reactivity might cost 1/100th of that.</em></p><p><em>Here's to a future where every Omani is a millionaire from peridotite excise taxes.</em></p></blockquote><p>For reference, $100 per ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere is the equivalent of adding ~$1.00 to the cost of a gallon of gas to make it carbon neutral.</p><h5>Driverless trucks</h5><p>We hear a lot less about driverless cars than driverless trucks, but apparently the latter is making progress as well. Via <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/texas-driverless-trucks\">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Autonomous trucking companies have been testing their fleets on Texas highways for several years, but always with backup safety drivers in the cab.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Now, one company, Aurora Innovation, says it plans to go completely driverless at the end of the month, a key milestone that promises to reshape the trucking industry.</em></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Driving the news</strong>: After years of development, Pittsburgh-based Aurora is launching commercial driverless operations this month on a popular freight route between Dallas and Houston.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>The first autonomous truck is expected to roll down I-45 in the coming days, although Aurora officials declined to share any details.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The company has said it will begin slowly, with one truck, and will gradually expand the fleet over time&#8230;.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>At least 10 companies are known to be developing driverless technology for trucks.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Most expect to \"pull the driver\" &#8212; or go fully autonomous &#8212; on public roads later this year or in 2026.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I&#8217;d never heard of Aurora Innovation, but it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Innovation\">seems to be a serious operation</a>. It was founded by former Waymo CTO Chris Urmson (before it became Waymo) and former head of Tesla Autopilot Sterling Anderson, and has raised several hundred million in VC and another $2 billion after going public via a SPAC.</p><p>It&#8217;s also interesting that Texas is such a hotspot for self-driving truck development, given that it&#8217;s also a major hub for <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-041925\">drone delivery startups</a>.</p><h5>History of consumer drones</h5><p>On the subject of drones, I enjoyed watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35HIK_OGtY\">this history of the early consumer drone industry</a> (covering from 2012 to 2019). Some interesting things to me:</p><ul><li><p>DJI was a major player early on, but the early drones were in many ways quite limited and janky. DJI&#8217;s first drone had no camera, and when the company released a camera mount installing it required opening up the drone and modifying the electronics with a soldering iron</p></li><li><p>The early industry was heavily driven by Kickstarters. Lots of folks would set up a Kickstarter for some impressive drone concept, and raise an enormous amount of money. More often than not it seems like these folks failed to deliver.</p></li></ul><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png\" width=\"675\" height=\"529\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h5>Drone-redirected lightning</h5><p>Also on the subject of drones, Japanese telecom company NTT has been running experiments to use drones to trigger lightning strikes, directing the lightning away from areas where it might do damage. Via <a href=\"https://group.ntt/en/newsrelease/2025/04/18/250418a.html\">NTT</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>On December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).</em></p><p><em>Just before the lightning strike, it was confirmed that a voltage of over 2000 volts had developed between the wire and the ground. This rapid increase in local electric field strength triggered a lightning strike directed at the drone. This marks the first successful case in the world of triggering lightning using a drone.</em></p><p><em>At the moment of the strike, a loud cracking sound was heard, a flash was observed at the winch, and partial melting occurred in the drone's lightning protection cage (Figure 4). However, the drone equipped with the protective cage continued to fly stably even after the lightning strike&#8230;</em></p><p><em>NTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones&#8212;designed to withstand direct lightning strikes&#8212;to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away.</em></p><div

This week we look at enhanced rock weathering, driverless trucks, Home Depot’s garden experiments, hydrogen airplanes, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nEnhanced rock weathering\nEnhanced rock weathering is a proposed method of removing CO2 from the air by breaking up large volumes of rock into small particles, and letting carbon dioxide in the air react with those particles to form carbonate minerals. It’s attractive as a method of carbon sequestration because it could potentially remove very large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere relatively cheaply. Austin Vernon crunches the numbers on it, and finds while the most optimistic projections of $10 per ton of carbon removed aren’t doable, it still seems promising:\n\nOverall, achieving an undiscounted cost of CO2 removal that is less than $100/ton at the billions or even trillions of tons scale seems doable. And while the market might not support that scale of effort, there is a profound impact on policy. Most environmental subsidies cost more than $100/ton of CO2. For example, assume an existing natural gas power plant costs $40/MWh to run and emits 0.4 tons CO2/MWh. Replacement generation that costs $100/MWh would have an abatement cost of $150/ton of CO2. Targeted subsidies for specific technologies look even worse compared to blanket carbon taxes/removals than they did before. $1 billion would buy a fully-scaled first site to prove that globally relevant weathering amounts are viable. Field studies to verify a location and rock reactivity might cost 1/100th of that.\nHere's to a future where every Omani is a millionaire from peridotite excise taxes.\nFor reference, $100 per ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere is the equivalent of adding ~$1.00 to the cost of a gallon of gas to make it carbon neutral.\nDriverless trucks\nWe hear a lot less about driverless cars than driverless trucks, but apparently the latter is making progress as well. Via Axios:\n\nAutonomous trucking companies have been testing their fleets on Texas highways for several years, but always with backup safety drivers in the cab.\n\nNow, one company, Aurora Innovation, says it plans to go completely driverless at the end of the month, a key milestone that promises to reshape the trucking industry.\nDriving the news: After years of development, Pittsburgh-based Aurora is launching commercial driverless operations this month on a popular freight route between Dallas and Houston.\n\nThe first autonomous truck is expected to roll down I-45 in the coming days, although Aurora officials declined to share any details.\n\nThe company has said it will begin slowly, with one truck, and will gradually expand the fleet over time….\nAt least 10 companies are known to be developing driverless technology for trucks.\n\nMost expect to \"pull the driver\" — or go fully autonomous — on public roads later this year or in 2026.\nI’d never heard of Aurora Innovation, but it seems to be a serious operation. It was founded by former Waymo CTO Chris Urmson (before it became Waymo) and former head of Tesla Autopilot Sterling Anderson, and has raised several hundred million in VC and another $2 billion after going public via a SPAC.\nIt’s also interesting that Texas is such a hotspot for self-driving truck development, given that it’s also a major hub for drone delivery startups.\nHistory of consumer drones\nOn the subject of drones, I enjoyed watching this history of the early consumer drone industry(covering from 2012 to 2019). Some interesting things to me:\n\nDJI was a major player early on, but the early drones were in many ways quite limited and janky. DJI’s first drone had no camera, and when the company released a camera mount installing it required opening up the drone and modifying the electronics with a soldering iron\n\nThe early industry was heavily driven by Kickstarters. Lots of folks would set up a Kickstarter for some impressive drone concept, and raise an enormous amount of money. More often than not it seems like these folks failed to deliver.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nDrone-redirected lightning\nAlso on the subject of drones, Japanese telecom company NTT has been running experiments to use drones to trigger lightning strikes, directing the lightning away from areas where it might do damage. Via NTT:\n\nOn December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).\nJust before the lightning strike, it was confirmed that a voltage of over 2000 volts had developed between the wire and the ground. This rapid increase in local electric field strength triggered a lightning strike directed at the drone. This marks the first successful case in the world of triggering lightning using a drone.\nAt the moment of the strike, a loud cracking sound was heard, a flash was observed at the winch, and partial melting occurred in the drone's lightning protection cage (Figure 4). However, the drone equipped with the protective cage continued to fly stably even after the lightning strike…\nNTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones—designed to withstand direct lightning strikes—to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAlso on the subject of lightning strikes, there are apparently several cases of people dying from electrocution after lightning struck their house while they were using a plugged-in smartphone.\nRead more",

However, the way this was implemented was needlessly burdensome: rather than setting noise limits for supersonic aircraft, the ban prevented non-military aircraft from travelling faster than the speed of sound at all, even if they could do so without generating a sonic boom. The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/06/leading-the-world-in-supersonic-flight/\">new executive order</a> requires the FAA to repeal this regulation, and replace it with a noise-based standard:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law.</em></p></blockquote><p>I&#8217;m aware of various efforts for quieter supersonic travel, including NASA&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_X-59_Quesst\">X-59</a> and Boom Supersonic&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://spaceinsider.tech/2025/02/11/how-boom-supersonics-boomless-cruise-mode-works/\">boomless cruise</a>&#8221;, but I&#8217;m not an aerospace expert and I&#8217;m not sure how practical they&#8217;ll end up being.

It handles a variety of different object types of different rigidities (boxes, soft packages, thin envelopes) quickly and smoothly, for a very long period of time. (At one point it successfully picks up what looks like a thin piece of cardstock with the aid of a ramp.) The tasks aren&#8217;t incredibly dexterously demanding, but it&#8217;s still much more than I&#8217;ve seen other humanoid robots accomplish.</p><p>In other humanoid news, 1X Robotics released a <a href=\"https://x.com/TheHumanoidHub/status/1932864588648964459\">new demo</a> showing their Neo robot doing things like walking outside and climbing stairs.</p><h5>Robot foundation model training</h5><p>AI software, like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT and Anthropic&#8217;s Claude, are powered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_model\">foundation models</a>: large neural network models trained on enormous amounts of data. These foundation models can then be used as a base for more specialized AI models trained to perform specific tasks (hence the name &#8220;foundation model&#8221;).</p><p>Efforts are underway to create similar foundation models for robotics, but a common bottleneck is the lack of availability of data. The models behind things like ChatGPT had the benefit of having the entire internet as their training data. GPT-3, for instance, was trained on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165\">300 billion tokens</a> (where a token is a chunk of data roughly equivalent to 3/4ths of a word), and it&#8217;s estimated that the training set for GPT-4 is in the trillions of tokens. No such easily accessible dataset currently exists for training robot foundation models.</p><p>On substack, Chris Paxton <a href=\"https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/how-can-we-get-enough-data-to-train\">estimates how much effort it would require</a> to create a large dataset that could be used to train a robot foundation model.</p><blockquote><p><em>Assume we have a robot that can collect 1 (valuable) token per frame at 10 frames per second. We make this assumption because, largely, robot tokens are not as valuable as LLM tokens - the information Qwen or Llama is trained on is very semantically rich, whereas robot frames often have a lot of redundant information. To put it another way: machine learning works best the closer you are to an independent and identically distributed (iid) dataset; neither web data nor robot data is iid, but robot data is far less iid than web data.</em></p><p><em>Okay, now let&#8217;s assume the robot collects its data all day, every day, forever. A year has 365.25 days &#215; 24 hours &#215; 3600 seconds = 31,557,600 seconds total; at 10 fps, to get to 2 trillion tokens, we need 6,377 years worth of data (rounding up).</em></p><p><em>Now, that&#8217;s assuming it runs 24/7, and is getting useful data every second of every day, which seems wildly implausible. Let&#8217;s say we 10x it, and then round up a bit more - call it 70,000 robot-years to get to our 2 trillion (useful) token llama2 dataset&#8230;</em></p></blockquote><p>Paxton estimates that getting the 2-trillion tokens needed for a robot GPT would require ~70,000 robot-years of training(!), but by using the data from 1000 robots, and augmenting real-world training data with simulated training data and videos of humans performing tasks, this could be achieved in less than a year. A multi-billion dollar project, to be sure, but one that&#8217;s achievable.</p><h5>Reconductoring</h5><p>Rising power demand requires lots of new electrical generation capacity, but it also requires more transmission lines to bring that power where it&#8217;s needed. Unfortunately, building transmission lines in the US has become <a href=\"https://ifp.org/how-cost-allocation-works-for-transmission-lines/\">more and more difficult</a>.</p><p>One possible way to cut this knot is to rewire existing transmission lines to have more capacity; this is known as &#8220;reconductoring&#8221;, and can involve using transmission lines with stronger composite cores, or with trapezoidal-shaped wires that can be more densely packed. An <a href=\"https://hackaday.com/2025/06/11/reconductoring-building-tomorrows-grid-today/\">article on Hackaday explains how it works</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The point of composite cores is to provide the conductor with the necessary tensile strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient, so that heating due to loading and environmental conditions causes the cable to sag less. Controlling sag is critical to cable capacity; the less likely a cable is to sag when heated, the more load it can carry. Additionally, composite cores can have a smaller cross-sectional area than a steel core with the same tensile strength, leaving room for more aluminum in the outer layers while maintaining the same overall conductor diameter. And of course, more aluminum means these advanced conductors can carry more current.</em></p><p><em>Another way to increase the capacity in advanced conductors is by switching to trapezoidal wires. Traditional ACSR with round wires in the core and conductor layers has a significant amount of dielectric space trapped within the conductor, which contributes nothing to the cable&#8217;s current-carrying capacity. Filling those internal voids with aluminum is accomplished by wrapping round composite cores with aluminum wires that have a trapezoidal cross-section to pack tightly against each other. This greatly reduces the dielectric space trapped within a conductor, increasing its ampacity within the same overall diameter.</em></p></blockquote><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png\" width=\"577\" height=\"349.085\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:577,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8c4829a-98ac-4a5b-b0fb-a65bd57b2c61_800x484.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Typical aluminum-conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) transmission line on the left, and a more densely packed aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC) on the right, via <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ACSR_and_ACCC.JPG\">Wikipedia</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-for-061425\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

This week we look at Figure’s new humanoid robot demo, what it would take to create the data for a robot foundation model, “right to repair” on naval vessels, electricity costs and power laws, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nNo essay this week, but I’m working on a more involved one about housing costs in the western US that will be out next week.\nSupersonic flight executive order\nSupersonic flight over land has been banned in the US since 1973, due to widespread opposition to sonic booms. However, the way this was implemented was needlessly burdensome: rather than setting noise limits for supersonic aircraft, the ban prevented non-military aircraft from travelling faster than the speed of sound at all, even if they could do so without generating a sonic boom. The new executive order requires the FAA to repeal this regulation, and replace it with a noise-based standard:\n\nThe Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall take the necessary steps, including through rulemaking, to repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight in 14 CFR 91.817 within 180 days of the date of this order and establish an interim noise-based certification standard, making any modifications to 14 CFR 91.818 as necessary, as consistent with applicable law.\nI’m aware of various efforts for quieter supersonic travel, including NASA’s X-59 and Boom Supersonic’s “ boomless cruise ”, but I’m not an aerospace expert and I’m not sure how practical they’ll end up being. But regardless, replacing a burdensome prescriptive standard (“to minimize noise, you shall not travel faster than this”) with a performance-based one (“you shall make less noise than this”) seems very positive to me.\nFigure AI’s 1-hour humanoid demo\nHumanoid robot developer Figure AI released an hour-long video of one of their robots autonomously (no teleoperation) scanning packages and placing them on a conveyor belt:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis was apparently made possible due to improvements in Helix, the “Vision-Language-Action model” that powers Figure’s robots.

The models behind things like ChatGPT had the benefit of having the entire internet as their training data. GPT-3, for instance, was trained on 300 billion tokens(where a token is a chunk of data roughly equivalent to 3/4ths of a word), and it’s estimated that the training set for GPT-4 is in the trillions of tokens. No such easily accessible dataset currently exists for training robot foundation models.\nOn substack, Chris Paxton estimates how much effort it would require to create a large dataset that could be used to train a robot foundation model.\n\nAssume we have a robot that can collect 1 (valuable) token per frame at 10 frames per second. We make this assumption because, largely, robot tokens are not as valuable as LLM tokens - the information Qwen or Llama is trained on is very semantically rich, whereas robot frames often have a lot of redundant information. To put it another way: machine learning works best the closer you are to an independent and identically distributed (iid) dataset; neither web data nor robot data is iid, but robot data is far less iid than web data.\nOkay, now let’s assume the robot collects its data all day, every day, forever. A year has 365.25 days × 24 hours × 3600 seconds = 31,557,600 seconds total; at 10 fps, to get to 2 trillion tokens, we need 6,377 years worth of data (rounding up).\nNow, that’s assuming it runs 24/7, and is getting useful data every second of every day, which seems wildly implausible. Let’s say we 10x it, and then round up a bit more - call it 70,000 robot-years to get to our 2 trillion (useful) token llama2 dataset…\nPaxton estimates that getting the 2-trillion tokens needed for a robot GPT would require ~70,000 robot-years of training(!), but by using the data from 1000 robots, and augmenting real-world training data with simulated training data and videos of humans performing tasks, this could be achieved in less than a year. A multi-billion dollar project, to be sure, but one that’s achievable.\nReconductoring\nRising power demand requires lots of new electrical generation capacity, but it also requires more transmission lines to bring that power where it’s needed. Unfortunately, building transmission lines in the US has become more and more difficult.\nOne possible way to cut this knot is to rewire existing transmission lines to have more capacity; this is known as “reconductoring”, and can involve using transmission lines with stronger composite cores, or with trapezoidal-shaped wires that can be more densely packed. An article on Hackaday explains how it works:\n\nThe point of composite cores is to provide the conductor with the necessary tensile strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient, so that heating due to loading and environmental conditions causes the cable to sag less. Controlling sag is critical to cable capacity; the less likely a cable is to sag when heated, the more load it can carry. Additionally, composite cores can have a smaller cross-sectional area than a steel core with the same tensile strength, leaving room for more aluminum in the outer layers while maintaining the same overall conductor diameter. And of course, more aluminum means these advanced conductors can carry more current.\nAnother way to increase the capacity in advanced conductors is by switching to trapezoidal wires. Traditional ACSR with round wires in the core and conductor layers has a significant amount of dielectric space trapped within the conductor, which contributes nothing to the cable’s current-carrying capacity. Filling those internal voids with aluminum is accomplished by wrapping round composite cores with aluminum wires that have a trapezoidal cross-section to pack tightly against each other. This greatly reduces the dielectric space trapped within a conductor, increasing its ampacity within the same overall diameter.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nTypical aluminum-conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) transmission line on the left, and a more densely packed aluminum conductor composite core (ACCC) on the right, via Wikipedia.\nRead more",

This week we look at enhanced rock weathering, driverless trucks, Home Depot&#8217;s garden experiments, hydrogen airplanes, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><h5>Enhanced rock weathering</h5><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_weathering\">Enhanced rock weathering</a> is a proposed method of removing CO2 from the air by breaking up large volumes of rock into small particles, and letting carbon dioxide in the air react with those particles to form carbonate minerals. It&#8217;s attractive as a method of carbon sequestration because it could potentially remove very large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere relatively cheaply. Austin Vernon <a href=\"https://austinvernon.site/blog/rockweathering.html\">crunches the numbers on it</a><em>, </em>and finds while the most optimistic projections of $10 per ton of carbon removed aren&#8217;t doable, it still seems promising:</p><blockquote><p><em>Overall, achieving an undiscounted cost of CO2 removal that is less than $100/ton at the billions or even trillions of tons scale seems doable. And while the market might not support that scale of effort, there is a profound impact on policy. Most environmental subsidies cost more than $100/ton of CO2. For example, assume an existing natural gas power plant costs $40/MWh to run and emits 0.4 tons CO2/MWh. Replacement generation that costs $100/MWh would have an abatement cost of $150/ton of CO2. Targeted subsidies for specific technologies look even worse compared to blanket carbon taxes/removals than they did before. $1 billion would buy a fully-scaled first site to prove that globally relevant weathering amounts are viable. Field studies to verify a location and rock reactivity might cost 1/100th of that.</em></p><p><em>Here's to a future where every Omani is a millionaire from peridotite excise taxes.</em></p></blockquote><p>For reference, $100 per ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere is the equivalent of adding ~$1.00 to the cost of a gallon of gas to make it carbon neutral.</p><h5>Driverless trucks</h5><p>We hear a lot less about driverless cars than driverless trucks, but apparently the latter is making progress as well. Via <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/23/texas-driverless-trucks\">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Autonomous trucking companies have been testing their fleets on Texas highways for several years, but always with backup safety drivers in the cab.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Now, one company, Aurora Innovation, says it plans to go completely driverless at the end of the month, a key milestone that promises to reshape the trucking industry.</em></p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Driving the news</strong>: After years of development, Pittsburgh-based Aurora is launching commercial driverless operations this month on a popular freight route between Dallas and Houston.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>The first autonomous truck is expected to roll down I-45 in the coming days, although Aurora officials declined to share any details.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The company has said it will begin slowly, with one truck, and will gradually expand the fleet over time&#8230;.</em></p></li></ul><p><em>At least 10 companies are known to be developing driverless technology for trucks.</em></p><ul><li><p><em>Most expect to \"pull the driver\" &#8212; or go fully autonomous &#8212; on public roads later this year or in 2026.</em></p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I&#8217;d never heard of Aurora Innovation, but it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Innovation\">seems to be a serious operation</a>. It was founded by former Waymo CTO Chris Urmson (before it became Waymo) and former head of Tesla Autopilot Sterling Anderson, and has raised several hundred million in VC and another $2 billion after going public via a SPAC.</p><p>It&#8217;s also interesting that Texas is such a hotspot for self-driving truck development, given that it&#8217;s also a major hub for <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-041925\">drone delivery startups</a>.</p><h5>History of consumer drones</h5><p>On the subject of drones, I enjoyed watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s35HIK_OGtY\">this history of the early consumer drone industry</a> (covering from 2012 to 2019). Some interesting things to me:</p><ul><li><p>DJI was a major player early on, but the early drones were in many ways quite limited and janky. DJI&#8217;s first drone had no camera, and when the company released a camera mount installing it required opening up the drone and modifying the electronics with a soldering iron</p></li><li><p>The early industry was heavily driven by Kickstarters. Lots of folks would set up a Kickstarter for some impressive drone concept, and raise an enormous amount of money. More often than not it seems like these folks failed to deliver.</p></li></ul><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png\" width=\"675\" height=\"529\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:529,&quot;width&quot;:675,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MbtO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed37d7cd-50bb-4f33-9adb-2dd996731598_675x529.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><h5>Drone-redirected lightning</h5><p>Also on the subject of drones, Japanese telecom company NTT has been running experiments to use drones to trigger lightning strikes, directing the lightning away from areas where it might do damage. Via <a href=\"https://group.ntt/en/newsrelease/2025/04/18/250418a.html\">NTT</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>On December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).</em></p><p><em>Just before the lightning strike, it was confirmed that a voltage of over 2000 volts had developed between the wire and the ground. This rapid increase in local electric field strength triggered a lightning strike directed at the drone. This marks the first successful case in the world of triggering lightning using a drone.</em></p><p><em>At the moment of the strike, a loud cracking sound was heard, a flash was observed at the winch, and partial melting occurred in the drone's lightning protection cage (Figure 4). However, the drone equipped with the protective cage continued to fly stably even after the lightning strike&#8230;</em></p><p><em>NTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones&#8212;designed to withstand direct lightning strikes&#8212;to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away.</em></p><div

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBullwinkle oil platform being towed out to sea, via Wikipedia.\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure and industrial technology. This week we look at enhanced rock weathering, driverless trucks, Home Depot’s garden experiments, hydrogen airplanes, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nEnhanced rock weathering\nEnhanced rock weathering is a proposed method of removing CO2 from the air by breaking up large volumes of rock into small particles, and letting carbon dioxide in the air react with those particles to form carbonate minerals. It’s attractive as a method of carbon sequestration because it could potentially remove very large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere relatively cheaply. Austin Vernon crunches the numbers on it, and finds while the most optimistic projections of $10 per ton of carbon removed aren’t doable, it still seems promising:\n\nOverall, achieving an undiscounted cost of CO2 removal that is less than $100/ton at the billions or even trillions of tons scale seems doable. And while the market might not support that scale of effort, there is a profound impact on policy. Most environmental subsidies cost more than $100/ton of CO2. For example, assume an existing natural gas power plant costs $40/MWh to run and emits 0.4 tons CO2/MWh. Replacement generation that costs $100/MWh would have an abatement cost of $150/ton of CO2. Targeted subsidies for specific technologies look even worse compared to blanket carbon taxes/removals than they did before. $1 billion would buy a fully-scaled first site to prove that globally relevant weathering amounts are viable. Field studies to verify a location and rock reactivity might cost 1/100th of that.\nHere's to a future where every Omani is a millionaire from peridotite excise taxes.\nFor reference, $100 per ton of carbon removed from the atmosphere is the equivalent of adding ~$1.00 to the cost of a gallon of gas to make it carbon neutral.\nDriverless trucks\nWe hear a lot less about driverless cars than driverless trucks, but apparently the latter is making progress as well. Via Axios:\n\nAutonomous trucking companies have been testing their fleets on Texas highways for several years, but always with backup safety drivers in the cab.\n\nNow, one company, Aurora Innovation, says it plans to go completely driverless at the end of the month, a key milestone that promises to reshape the trucking industry.\nDriving the news: After years of development, Pittsburgh-based Aurora is launching commercial driverless operations this month on a popular freight route between Dallas and Houston.\n\nThe first autonomous truck is expected to roll down I-45 in the coming days, although Aurora officials declined to share any details.\n\nThe company has said it will begin slowly, with one truck, and will gradually expand the fleet over time….\nAt least 10 companies are known to be developing driverless technology for trucks.\n\nMost expect to \"pull the driver\" — or go fully autonomous — on public roads later this year or in 2026.\nI’d never heard of Aurora Innovation, but it seems to be a serious operation. It was founded by former Waymo CTO Chris Urmson (before it became Waymo) and former head of Tesla Autopilot Sterling Anderson, and has raised several hundred million in VC and another $2 billion after going public via a SPAC.\nIt’s also interesting that Texas is such a hotspot for self-driving truck development, given that it’s also a major hub for drone delivery startups.\nHistory of consumer drones\nOn the subject of drones, I enjoyed watching this history of the early consumer drone industry(covering from 2012 to 2019). Some interesting things to me:\n\nDJI was a major player early on, but the early drones were in many ways quite limited and janky. DJI’s first drone had no camera, and when the company released a camera mount installing it required opening up the drone and modifying the electronics with a soldering iron\n\nThe early industry was heavily driven by Kickstarters. Lots of folks would set up a Kickstarter for some impressive drone concept, and raise an enormous amount of money. More often than not it seems like these folks failed to deliver.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nDrone-redirected lightning\nAlso on the subject of drones, Japanese telecom company NTT has been running experiments to use drones to trigger lightning strikes, directing the lightning away from areas where it might do damage. Via NTT:\n\nOn December 13, 2024, during the approach of a thundercloud, the electric field strength observed by the field mill increased. At that moment, a drone equipped with a conductive wire was flown to an altitude of 300 meters. The drone was then electrically connected to the ground via a switch installed on the ground (Figure 2). As a result, a large current was observed flowing through the wire, accompanied by a significant change in the surrounding electric field strength (Figure 3).\nJust before the lightning strike, it was confirmed that a voltage of over 2000 volts had developed between the wire and the ground. This rapid increase in local electric field strength triggered a lightning strike directed at the drone. This marks the first successful case in the world of triggering lightning using a drone.\nAt the moment of the strike, a loud cracking sound was heard, a flash was observed at the winch, and partial melting occurred in the drone's lightning protection cage (Figure 4). However, the drone equipped with the protective cage continued to fly stably even after the lightning strike…\nNTT aims to protect cities and people from lightning damage by flying drones—designed to withstand direct lightning strikes—to accurately predict lightning-prone locations, actively trigger strikes, and safely guide them away.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAlso on the subject of lightning strikes, there are apparently several cases of people dying from electrocution after lightning struck their house while they were using a plugged-in smartphone.\nRead more",

Over the past four and a half years I&#8217;ve written 186 essays, totalling around 600,000 words. The newsletter was originally focused on understanding the problems of construction productivity (though it&#8217;s never been entirely about that), but I have branched out to write more about a variety of topics, including energy, transportation, and scientific and technological progress.</p><p>Because the scope of what I write about has gotten so broad, and the backlog has gotten so large, I thought it would be useful to condense a list of some of the major things I&#8217;ve learned writing the newsletter. It&#8217;s not a summary of every newsletter I&#8217;ve written, but a collection of what I think are some of the major high-level takeaways, interesting or surprising facts, and things that gave a major update to my worldview.</p><h4>Homes, homebuilding, and construction</h4><ol><li><p><a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis\">Roughly 90%</a> of buildings in the US are single family homes, and single family homes make up 60% of the total building square footage in the country.</p></li><li><p>Prefab construction is typically not any cheaper than conventional, on-site construction, either in the US or around the world. When it is cheaper, it&#8217;s often because it takes advantage of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/autovol-stack-modular-and-labor-arbitrage\">low-cost labor</a>, rather than for efficiency reasons.</p></li><li><p>A big exception to the above is manufactured or mobile homes, which are <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mobile-home\">substantially cheaper</a> than conventionally built homes.</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s a thesis that the manufactured home industry was irrecoverably wounded by burdensome HUD code requirements in the early 1970s. This thesis is <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-manufactured\">incorrect</a>: the collapse of the industry was much more likely driven by changes in lending standards.</p></li><li><p>Levittown mass-produced homes <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-levittown-didnt-revolutionize\">were not substantially cheaper to build</a> than other, conventionally-built homes at the time.</p></li><li><p>Large-scale damage from wildfires is often blamed on extensive use of wood construction in the US, but whether a home survives a wildfire seems to be more affected by things like <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-011825\">home age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/wood-construction-and-the-risk-of\">fire-resistant design details</a> than whether it&#8217;s made of wood.</p></li><li><p>Most attempts at construction innovation have a very long history. Construction startup <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/another-day-in-katerradise\">Katerra&#8217;s</a> attempt to achieve low costs through factory-built, mass-produced homes was predated by things like the <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-lustron-home\">Lustron Home</a> in the 1940s, <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/operation-breakthrough-americas-failed\">Operation Breakthrough</a> in the 1960s, and <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/toyotas-prefab-homes\">Toyota&#8217;s homebuilding division</a>. Mechanical bricklayers have been attempted repeatedly since the <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/where-are-the-robotic-bricklayers\">late 19th century</a>.</p></li><li><p>For as far back as we have data (the late 19th/early 20th century), outside of a few brief windows, construction in the US has <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/does-construction-ever-get-cheaper\">never gotten cheaper</a>.</p></li><li><p>Individual construction tasks have, on average, not gotten cheaper since <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/which-construction-tasks-have-gotten\">at least the 1950s</a>.</p></li><li><p>Bricks haven&#8217;t gotten cheaper since <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/bricks-and-the-industrial-revolution\">the mid-19th century</a>, despite massive improvements in brickmaking technology.</p></li><li><p>Construction has a reputation for being slow to innovate, but innovations seem to spread in construction at roughly similar rates to other industries, like <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-construction-innovation-uptake\">car manufacturing or agriculture</a>.</p></li><li><p>Single family homes use <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/looking-at-energy-use-in-us-residential\">less energy per square foot</a> than multifamily apartments, likely because certain \"fixed\" energy costs like refrigerators and water heaters are spread across more living space.</p></li><li><p>Historically high US homebuilding rates were in large part driven by <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/is-there-a-housing-shortage-or-not\">falling household size</a>. If you control for this factor, the current low rates of US homebuilding looks less dire.</p></li><li><p>A common intuition is that people demand variety in their homes, and that this prevents the adoption of mass-production methods for homebuilding, but this intuition is wrong: repetitive designs are <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/debunking-the-housing-variety-as\">very widely used</a> in housing construction.</p></li><li><p>Construction has gotten much safer over time: not only have death and injury rates in construction fallen, but they&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-much-safer-has-construction-gotten\">fallen much more</a> than in agriculture or manufacturing.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mail-order\">Sears did not pioneer the mail order home</a>. Other companies like Aladdin Homes sold homes through the mail for years before Sears did, and they continued to sell mail-order homes well into the 1980s, decades after Sears left the business.</p></li><li><p>Construction in general has <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/when-did-new-york-start-building\">gotten slower</a> in the US over time, but the contours of these speed changes aren&#8217;t uniform, and are sometimes surprising. The speed of New York skyscraper construction has fallen by more than 50% since the 1960s, but in Chicago speeds are down just 10% from the 1960s (though the decline from peak speeds in the 1970s is greater). Today Chicago skyscrapers are built roughly twice as fast as New York skyscrapers.</p></li><li><p>Even though US skyscraper construction has gotten slower, the US still does well compared to other countries. The US builds skyscrapers at a <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/which-city-builds-skyscrapers-the\">comparable speed to China</a>, at least for major, high-profile ones.</p></li><li><p>It's hard to make modern buildings cheaper by <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-valuable-are-building-methods\">cutting unnecessary material</a> out of them: this fruit has mostly been picked.</p></li><li><p>The modernist, glass box aesthetic took hold in skyscraper construction because it was <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-skyscrapers-became-glass-boxes\">cheaper to build</a>, and tenants by and large didn't care what the exterior of the building looked like.</p></li><li><p>Homeowners insurance has steadily gotten <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-is-homeowners-insurance-getting\">more expensive</a> over time.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been writing Construction Physics since September of 2020. Over the past four and a half years I’ve written 186 essays, totalling around 600,000 words. The newsletter was originally focused on understanding the problems of construction productivity (though it’s never been entirely about that), but I have branched out to write more about a variety of topics, including energy, transportation, and scientific and technological progress.\nBecause the scope of what I write about has gotten so broad, and the backlog has gotten so large, I thought it would be useful to condense a list of some of the major things I’ve learned writing the newsletter. It’s not a summary of every newsletter I’ve written, but a collection of what I think are some of the major high-level takeaways, interesting or surprising facts, and things that gave a major update to my worldview.\nHomes, homebuilding, and construction\n\nRoughly 90% of buildings in the US are single family homes, and single family homes make up 60% of the total building square footage in the country.\n\nPrefab construction is typically not any cheaper than conventional, on-site construction, either in the US or around the world. When it is cheaper, it’s often because it takes advantage of low-cost labor, rather than for efficiency reasons.\n\nA big exception to the above is manufactured or mobile homes, which are substantially cheaper than conventionally built homes.\n\nThere’s a thesis that the manufactured home industry was irrecoverably wounded by burdensome HUD code requirements in the early 1970s. This thesis is incorrect: the collapse of the industry was much more likely driven by changes in lending standards.\n\nLevittown mass-produced homes were not substantially cheaper to build than other, conventionally-built homes at the time.\n\nLarge-scale damage from wildfires is often blamed on extensive use of wood construction in the US, but whether a home survives a wildfire seems to be more affected by things like home age and fire-resistant design details than whether it’s made of wood.\n\nMost attempts at construction innovation have a very long history. Construction startup Katerra’s attempt to achieve low costs through factory-built, mass-produced homes was predated by things like the Lustron Home in the 1940s, Operation Breakthrough in the 1960s, and Toyota’s homebuilding division. Mechanical bricklayers have been attempted repeatedly since the late 19th century.\n\nFor as far back as we have data (the late 19th/early 20th century), outside of a few brief windows, construction in the US has never gotten cheaper.\n\nIndividual construction tasks have, on average, not gotten cheaper since at least the 1950s.\n\nBricks haven’t gotten cheaper since the mid-19th century, despite massive improvements in brickmaking technology.\n\nConstruction has a reputation for being slow to innovate, but innovations seem to spread in construction at roughly similar rates to other industries, like car manufacturing or agriculture.\n\nSingle family homes use less energy per square foot than multifamily apartments, likely because certain \"fixed\" energy costs like refrigerators and water heaters are spread across more living space.\n\nHistorically high US homebuilding rates were in large part driven by falling household size. If you control for this factor, the current low rates of US homebuilding looks less dire.\n\nA common intuition is that people demand variety in their homes, and that this prevents the adoption of mass-production methods for homebuilding, but this intuition is wrong: repetitive designs are very widely used in housing construction.\n\nConstruction has gotten much safer over time: not only have death and injury rates in construction fallen, but they’ve fallen much more than in agriculture or manufacturing.\n\nSears did not pioneer the mail order home. Other companies like Aladdin Homes sold homes through the mail for years before Sears did, and they continued to sell mail-order homes well into the 1980s, decades after Sears left the business.\n\nConstruction in general has gotten slower in the US over time, but the contours of these speed changes aren’t uniform, and are sometimes surprising. The speed of New York skyscraper construction has fallen by more than 50% since the 1960s, but in Chicago speeds are down just 10% from the 1960s (though the decline from peak speeds in the 1970s is greater). Today Chicago skyscrapers are built roughly twice as fast as New York skyscrapers.\n\nEven though US skyscraper construction has gotten slower, the US still does well compared to other countries. The US builds skyscrapers at a comparable speed to China, at least for major, high-profile ones.\n\nIt's hard to make modern buildings cheaper by cutting unnecessary material out of them: this fruit has mostly been picked.\n\nThe modernist, glass box aesthetic took hold in skyscraper construction because it was cheaper to build, and tenants by and large didn't care what the exterior of the building looked like.\n\nHomeowners insurance has steadily gotten more expensive over time. Rising construction costs and more frequent extreme weather events can only explain part of this increase. Increased home size and insurers profits likewise can’t explain it.\nEnergy\n\nThe first windmills for generating electricity appeared in the late 19th century. Wind-generated electricity was common on US farms until the Rural Electrification Administration built out transmission lines to rural areas.\n\nThe first gas turbines were built in the early 20th century, but they weren’t economical for large-scale power production until high enough temperatures and compressor efficiencies could be achieved. It wasn’t until after the 1965 Northeast blackout that gas turbines began to be adopted for electricity generation on a large scale.\n\nAn important inciting event for wind and solar getting widely deployed and falling down the learning curve was PURPA, the law that required US utilities to buy small amounts of power from independent producers. PURPA was the result of lobbying efforts from a single, small company in New Hampshire that wanted to burn garbage.\n\nAfter Texas, the state with the most planned electricity generation projects is Oregon.\n\nThe US has about 10,000 times as much energy storage capacity for hydrocarbons as it does for grid-scale electricity.\n\nA bottleneck in semiconductor manufacturing is high-purity quartz, most of which comes from a single town in North Carolina: Spruce Pine. Chip manufacturing could probably absorb the costs of switching to non-Spruce Pine quartz, but this would be much harder for solar PV manufacturing.\n\nThree Mile Island didn’t kill the US nuclear power industry: even before the accident new plant orders had ceased, and the industry was dying due to high and unpredictable plant costs.\n\nThe US Navy follows many best practices for nuclear reactor construction, such as design re-use, but this hasn’t been sufficient to make nuclear power cheaper than other forms of ship propulsion.\nTransportation and other infrastructure\n\nUrban areas have lower rates of power outages, and much lower rates of fire damage and death.\n\nWhenever there’s a major bridge incident in the US we hear stories about the US’s crumbling infrastructure, but the worst bridges in the US are steadily getting fixed. Between 1992 and 2023, the number of US bridges in critical condition declined by more than 70%.\n\nSimilarly, US interstate quality is improving over time, and US interstates are roughly as good as major highways in other countries.\n\nSan Francisco and Los Angeles have worse roads than any other large US metro.\n\nTunnel boring speed rose at an exponential rate from the early 19th century through the 1950s, but has slowed down since then. If Elon Musk’s Boring Company achieved its speed goals, it would put us back on track to achieve these historical rates of improvement.\n\nNo city grew as fast as Shenzhen in the 20th century, and Chinese cities in general grew faster than anywhere else.\n\nThe US has been an uncompetitive, high-cost shipbuilder since the transition from wood to iron and steel ships in the late 19th century. The Jones Act hasn’t helped this situation, but it’s not the cause of it.\n\nAT&T spent substantially more on telephone infrastructure in the 1960s than NASA spent on the Apollo Program.\n\nModern shipbuilding methods were invented in US shipyards that produced Liberty and Victory ships during WWII. After the war, a US shipyard supervisor, Elmer Hahn, brought the techniques to Japan, who improved and refined them. Several decades later, Japan had conquered the shipbuilding industry, and the US had to re-learn those same techniques from Japanese shipbuilders.\nScience and technology\n\nEarly on in the development of a technology, a Moore’s Law rate of improvement (doubling in performance every two years) isn’t particularly good.

If improvements are difficult to find, costs might stay high and production volumes stay low even at high learning rates. Titanium has a similar learning rate to solar PV, but the latter has fallen in cost much more than the former.\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century welding was widely automated by robots, but the jobs that were automated were mostly welding machine operators, not manual welders. In other words, welding robots mostly improved existing automation, rather than automating tasks that had previously been manually done.\n\nIndustrial robots of today aren’t much cheaper than industrial robots from the 1970s in terms of payload capacity, but modern robots are on the order of 50 to 100 times more accurate.\n\nMore Nobel Prize-winning research has been done at Cambridge than at any other university.\n\nBell Labs has done more Nobel Prize-winning work than the next six private corporations combined. Most of its prize-winning work was done by researchers hired after the company invented the transistor, at the peak of its prestige.\n\nThe prestige of Bell Labs inspired several other companies, like Ford, Exxon and Xerox, to fund similar labs that produced basic research uncoupled from concerns of immediate profitability.\n\nMorris Chang began his semiconductor career completely by chance. He originally planned to take a job at Ford, but got so angry at how he was treated when he asked for a higher salary that he took a job at electronics manufacturer Sylvania out of spite.\n\nRocket scientists weren’t the only Germany assets that the US and Russia divided up after WWII. They also each acquired some of Germany’s very large forging presses.\n\nResearch and development programs have generally gotten more expensive over time, but some things have always been pricey. Development costs for a new jet engine, or for a new commercial airliner, have been in the billions of inflation-adjusted dollars since the 1950s and 60s.\n\nNearly every aircraft the US produced in large numbers during WWII started design work before June 1940, more than a year before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.\n\nMaking a microchip requires thousands of process steps, and a silicon wafer might spend months going through the entire process.\nMy main takeaway from this list of takeaways, and from writing the newsletter more generally, is that there’s almost always more to the story. Things that seem like recent developments often have key predecessors going back decades or even centuries. What seem like historical inevitabilities are often highly contingent products of chance and circumstance.

Causes are often complex, and what seem like simple problems often tenaciously resist solutions.\nThis complexity is what makes writing Construction Physics so fulfilling to me.

This week we look at risks to US battery storage, un-affordable affordable housing, a major Supreme Court NEPA ruling, making chip materials in space, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.</p><h5>Battery storage risks</h5><p>Looking at the trends in <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/\">battery storage growth</a>, and the number of battery projects in the <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/inside-the-interconnection-queue\">interconnection queue</a>, the future of the battery storage industry in the US seems like it would be bright. But apparently things are shakier than I realized. Battery storage integrator (sort of like a general contractor for battery storage) <a href=\"https://powin.com/\">Powin</a>, one of the largest storage integrators in the world, announced that its laying off 250 employees and suspending operators, apparently due to a combination of tariffs, potential tax credit repeal, and other issues. Via <a href=\"https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/powin-warns-of-shutdown/\">Latitude Media</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Powin designs, commissions and services utility-scale battery projects, positioning itself as what CEO Jeff Waters calls &#8220;that one throat to choke&#8221; for utilities and power producers deploying storage assets.</em></p><p><em>According to rankings from S&amp;P, Powin had the third most gigawatt-hours of batteries installed in the U.S., in 2024, and the fourth most globally.</em></p><p><em>In January, Clean Energy Associates issued an analysis showing how the battery storage industry faced &#8220;multiple layers of policy risk,&#8221; ranging from tariffs, tax credit repeal, and Chinese content exclusions. Some large battery projects have been delayed as a result.</em></p><p><em>Developers are waiting to see the outcome of budget reconciliation later this year before moving forward with projects. Meanwhile, procurement has become increasingly complex as companies try to navigate overlapping tariff regimes and domestic content requirements.</em></p></blockquote><p>Related, Wood Mackenzie has a <a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/tariffs-to-increase-costs-and-slow-down-development-for-us-power-industry/\">new report out</a> suggesting that tariffs could drive the costs of battery storage up by 45%.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

an eye on this.</p><h5>Batteries in Pakistan</h5><p>In other battery news, we&#8217;ve <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/reading-list-04122025\">previously noted</a> that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of solar PV installation in the entire world, in part due to an <a href=\"https://theelectricityhub.com/pakistans-solar-boom-market-power-vs-grid-strain/#:~:text=Pakistan's%20energy%20sector%20faces%20several,increase%20the%20demand%20for%20cooling.\">exceptionally unreliable power grid</a>. Now it&#8217;s apparently starting to pair these with battery storage systems. From the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b4c598e-a4b3-4c6e-9c38-97e46357f819\">Financial Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Companies can now recover their investment in transitioning to predominantly renewable energy &#8212; using solar, wind and batteries &#8212; in less than two years.&#8221;</em></p><p><em>The battery storage systems are still too expensive to be adopted as widely as solar has been in Pakistan in the near future. But distributors say prices are falling rapidly and demand continues to grow.</em></p><p><em>Faaz Diwan, director at Karachi-based Diwan International, one of Pakistan&#8217;s largest solar and battery distributors, said the cost of the BYD batteries he sold had fallen by more than a third since last year to about Rs275,000 for a 5kWh unit that is enough to power a small house.</em></p><p><em>His company has been importing more than 500 batteries a month since March, three times more than last year, as wealthier households, gyms, mosques and businesses gobble up storage systems to save money on air-conditioning ahead of summer.</em></p></blockquote><h5>&#8220;Affordable&#8221; housing</h5><p>&#8220;Affordable&#8221; housing in the US generally doesn&#8217;t mean housing that&#8217;s inexpensive to build and thus cheap: it means housing where the developer takes advantage of the <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/lihtc.html\">Low-Income Housing Tax Credit</a> (a HUD program), or other similar credits, by allocating a certain number of housing units to people with low incomes. Ironically, the overhead of this program means that in practice, &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing can be incredibly expensive to build. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/06/06/these-publicly-funded-homes-poor-cost-12-million-each-develop/\">This article</a> from the Washington Post describes an &#8220;affordable&#8221; housing project has development costs of $1.2 million per unit, compared to just $350,000 per unit in a building built next door by the same developer, and digs into the reasons why:</p><blockquote><p><em>To make use of the credits, which lower a company&#8217;s tax liability dollar-for-dollar, developers typically partner with big companies, such as banks, that have tax liabilities big enough to benefit from them. While the credits are awarded in significant amounts &#8212; often tens of millions of dollars &#8212; developers typically have to augment them with various other funding sources. The resulting financing structures require small armies of lawyers and accountants to manage, driving up development costs.</em></p><p><em>While affordable housing developers and advocates privately acknowledge the program&#8217;s inefficiencies, they are reluctant to offer public criticism because, without it, tens of thousands of new affordable housing units per year would not be built.</em></p><p><em>Other cost drivers include wage requirements for construction workers that come with federal funding. There are also city requirements to hire local workers and bring on local small businesses. And the competition for public funds tends to produce smaller developments, so that the money can be spread around to numerous projects, which prevents developers from benefiting from economies of scale.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNational Ignition Facility target chamber, via@sci_fi_infra.\nWelcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology. This week we look at risks to US battery storage, un-affordable affordable housing, a major Supreme Court NEPA ruling, making chip materials in space, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.\nBattery storage risks\nLooking at the trends in battery storage growth, and the number of battery projects in the interconnection queue, the future of the battery storage industry in the US seems like it would be bright. But apparently things are shakier than I realized. Battery storage integrator (sort of like a general contractor for battery storage) Powin, one of the largest storage integrators in the world, announced that its laying off 250 employees and suspending operators, apparently due to a combination of tariffs, potential tax credit repeal, and other issues. Via Latitude Media:\n\nPowin designs, commissions and services utility-scale battery projects, positioning itself as what CEO Jeff Waters calls “that one throat to choke” for utilities and power producers deploying storage assets.\nAccording to rankings from S&P, Powin had the third most gigawatt-hours of batteries installed in the U.S., in 2024, and the fourth most globally.\nIn January, Clean Energy Associates issued an analysis showing how the battery storage industry faced “multiple layers of policy risk,” ranging from tariffs, tax credit repeal, and Chinese content exclusions. Some large battery projects have been delayed as a result.\nDevelopers are waiting to see the outcome of budget reconciliation later this year before moving forward with projects. Meanwhile, procurement has become increasingly complex as companies try to navigate overlapping tariff regimes and domestic content requirements.\nRelated, Wood Mackenzie has a new report out suggesting that tariffs could drive the costs of battery storage up by 45%.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not clear to me how representative the issues with Powin are of the industry more generally, but I’ll be keeping an eye on this.\nBatteries in Pakistan\nIn other battery news, we’ve previously noted that Pakistan has one of the highest rates of solar PV installation in the entire world, in part due to an exceptionally unreliable power grid. Now it’s apparently starting to pair these with battery storage systems. From the Financial Times:\n\n“Companies can now recover their investment in transitioning to predominantly renewable energy — using solar, wind and batteries — in less than two years.”\nThe battery storage systems are still too expensive to be adopted as widely as solar has been in Pakistan in the near future. But distributors say prices are falling rapidly and demand continues to grow.\nFaaz Diwan, director at Karachi-based Diwan International, one of Pakistan’s largest solar and battery distributors, said the cost of the BYD batteries he sold had fallen by more than a third since last year to about Rs275,000 for a 5kWh unit that is enough to power a small house.\nHis company has been importing more than 500 batteries a month since March, three times more than last year, as wealthier households, gyms, mosques and businesses gobble up storage systems to save money on air-conditioning ahead of summer.\n“Affordable” housing\n“Affordable” housing in the US generally doesn’t mean housing that’s inexpensive to build and thus cheap: it means housing where the developer takes advantage of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit(a HUD program), or other similar credits, by allocating a certain number of housing units to people with low incomes. Ironically, the overhead of this program means that in practice, “affordable” housing can be incredibly expensive to build. This article from the Washington Post describes an “affordable” housing project has development costs of $1.2 million per unit, compared to just $350,000 per unit in a building built next door by the same developer, and digs into the reasons why:\n\nTo make use of the credits, which lower a company’s tax liability dollar-for-dollar, developers typically partner with big companies, such as banks, that have tax liabilities big enough to benefit from them. While the credits are awarded in significant amounts — often tens of millions of dollars — developers typically have to augment them with various other funding sources. The resulting financing structures require small armies of lawyers and accountants to manage, driving up development costs.\nWhile affordable housing developers and advocates privately acknowledge the program’s inefficiencies, they are reluctant to offer public criticism because, without it, tens of thousands of new affordable housing units per year would not be built.\nOther cost drivers include wage requirements for construction workers that come with federal funding. There are also city requirements to hire local workers and bring on local small businesses. And the competition for public funds tends to produce smaller developments, so that the money can be spread around to numerous projects, which prevents developers from benefiting from economies of scale.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nUS housing affordability by county\nAlso on the subject of housing affordability, several years ago a redditor made this interesting map of US housing affordability by county, showing which counties have higher and lower ratios between median home price and median household income.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMaps like this often end up being just population maps in disguise, but this map has another effect superimposed on top of it. In counties with low population but a lot of scenic beauty, median income is probably low but median housing costs are probably high due to the presence of expensive vacation homes. This probably explains the big red blob on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina (home to the Blue Ridge Mountains), and the expensive coastal counties in Florida.\nThe other very obvious pattern here is how nearly every county west of the Rockies is extremely unafordable. I’m not sure how much of this is due to the above “scenic beauty vs low population” effect, and how much of it is high home prices broadly due to insufficient homebuilding. I can buy home shortages driving up prices in California, but is this really the case in Idaho, Utah, and Arizona?\nRead more",

Over the past four and a half years I&#8217;ve written 186 essays, totalling around 600,000 words. The newsletter was originally focused on understanding the problems of construction productivity (though it&#8217;s never been entirely about that), but I have branched out to write more about a variety of topics, including energy, transportation, and scientific and technological progress.</p><p>Because the scope of what I write about has gotten so broad, and the backlog has gotten so large, I thought it would be useful to condense a list of some of the major things I&#8217;ve learned writing the newsletter. It&#8217;s not a summary of every newsletter I&#8217;ve written, but a collection of what I think are some of the major high-level takeaways, interesting or surprising facts, and things that gave a major update to my worldview.</p><h4>Homes, homebuilding, and construction</h4><ol><li><p><a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis\">Roughly 90%</a> of buildings in the US are single family homes, and single family homes make up 60% of the total building square footage in the country.</p></li><li><p>Prefab construction is typically not any cheaper than conventional, on-site construction, either in the US or around the world. When it is cheaper, it&#8217;s often because it takes advantage of <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/autovol-stack-modular-and-labor-arbitrage\">low-cost labor</a>, rather than for efficiency reasons.</p></li><li><p>A big exception to the above is manufactured or mobile homes, which are <a href=\"https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-mobile-home\">substantially cheaper</a> than conventionally built homes.</p></li><li><p>There&#8217;s a thesis that the manufactured home industry was irrecoverably wounded by burdensome HUD code requirements in the early 1970s.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nI’ve been writing Construction Physics since September of 2020. Over the past four and a half years I’ve written 186 essays, totalling around 600,000 words. The newsletter was originally focused on understanding the problems of construction productivity (though it’s never been entirely about that), but I have branched out to write more about a variety of topics, including energy, transportation, and scientific and technological progress.\nBecause the scope of what I write about has gotten so broad, and the backlog has gotten so large, I thought it would be useful to condense a list of some of the major things I’ve learned writing the newsletter. It’s not a summary of every newsletter I’ve written, but a collection of what I think are some of the major high-level takeaways, interesting or surprising facts, and things that gave a major update to my worldview.\nHomes, homebuilding, and construction\n\nRoughly 90% of buildings in the US are single family homes, and single family homes make up 60% of the total building square footage in the country.\n\nPrefab construction is typically not any cheaper than conventional, on-site construction, either in the US or around the world. When it is cheaper, it’s often because it takes advantage of low-cost labor, rather than for efficiency reasons.\n\nA big exception to the above is manufactured or mobile homes, which are substantially cheaper than conventionally built homes.\n\nThere’s a thesis that the manufactured home industry was irrecoverably wounded by burdensome HUD code requirements in the early 1970s. This thesis is incorrect: the collapse of the industry was much more likely driven by changes in lending standards.\n\nLevittown mass-produced homes were not substantially cheaper to build than other, conventionally-built homes at the time.\n\nLarge-scale damage from wildfires is often blamed on extensive use of wood construction in the US, but whether a home survives a wildfire seems to be more affected by things like home age and fire-resistant design details than whether it’s made of wood.\n\nMost attempts at construction innovation have a very long history. Construction startup Katerra’s attempt to achieve low costs through factory-built, mass-produced homes was predated by things like the Lustron Home in the 1940s, Operation Breakthrough in the 1960s, and Toyota’s homebuilding division. Mechanical bricklayers have been attempted repeatedly since the late 19th century.\n\nFor as far back as we have data (the late 19th/early 20th century), outside of a few brief windows, construction in the US has never gotten cheaper.\n\nIndividual construction tasks have, on average, not gotten cheaper since at least the 1950s.\n\nBricks haven’t gotten cheaper since the mid-19th century, despite massive improvements in brickmaking technology.\n\nConstruction has a reputation for being slow to innovate, but innovations seem to spread in construction at roughly similar rates to other industries, like car manufacturing or agriculture.\n\nSingle family homes use less energy per square foot than multifamily apartments, likely because certain \"fixed\" energy costs like refrigerators and water heaters are spread across more living space.\n\nHistorically high US homebuilding rates were in large part driven by falling household size. If you control for this factor, the current low rates of US homebuilding looks less dire.\n\nA common intuition is that people demand variety in their homes, and that this prevents the adoption of mass-production methods for homebuilding, but this intuition is wrong: repetitive designs are very widely used in housing construction.\n\nConstruction has gotten much safer over time: not only have death and injury rates in construction fallen, but they’ve fallen much more than in agriculture or manufacturing.\n\nSears did not pioneer the mail order home. Other companies like Aladdin Homes sold homes through the mail for years before Sears did, and they continued to sell mail-order homes well into the 1980s, decades after Sears left the business.\n\nConstruction in general has gotten slower in the US over time, but the contours of these speed changes aren’t uniform, and are sometimes surprising. The speed of New York skyscraper construction has fallen by more than 50% since the 1960s, but in Chicago speeds are down just 10% from the 1960s (though the decline from peak speeds in the 1970s is greater). Today Chicago skyscrapers are built roughly twice as fast as New York skyscrapers.\n\nEven though US skyscraper construction has gotten slower, the US still does well compared to other countries. The US builds skyscrapers at a comparable speed to China, at least for major, high-profile ones.\n\nIt's hard to make modern buildings cheaper by cutting unnecessary material out of them: this fruit has mostly been picked.\n\nThe modernist, glass box aesthetic took hold in skyscraper construction because it was cheaper to build, and tenants by and large didn't care what the exterior of the building looked like.\n\nHomeowners insurance has steadily gotten more expensive over time. Rising construction costs and more frequent extreme weather events can only explain part of this increase. Increased home size and insurers profits likewise can’t explain it.\nEnergy\n\nThe first windmills for generating electricity appeared in the late 19th century. Wind-generated electricity was common on US farms until the Rural Electrification Administration built out transmission lines to rural areas.\n\nThe first gas turbines were built in the early 20th century, but they weren’t economical for large-scale power production until high enough temperatures and compressor efficiencies could be achieved. It wasn’t until after the 1965 Northeast blackout that gas turbines began to be adopted for electricity generation on a large scale.\n\nAn important inciting event for wind and solar getting widely deployed and falling down the learning curve was PURPA, the law that required US utilities to buy small amounts of power from independent producers. PURPA was the result of lobbying efforts from a single, small company in New Hampshire that wanted to burn garbage.\n\nAfter Texas, the state with the most planned electricity generation projects is Oregon.\n\nThe US has about 10,000 times as much energy storage capacity for hydrocarbons as it does for grid-scale electricity.\n\nA bottleneck in semiconductor manufacturing is high-purity quartz, most of which comes from a single town in North Carolina: Spruce Pine. Chip manufacturing could probably absorb the costs of switching to non-Spruce Pine quartz, but this would be much harder for solar PV manufacturing.\n\nThree Mile Island didn’t kill the US nuclear power industry: even before the accident new plant orders had ceased, and the industry was dying due to high and unpredictable plant costs.\n\nThe US Navy follows many best practices for nuclear reactor construction, such as design re-use, but this hasn’t been sufficient to make nuclear power cheaper than other forms of ship propulsion.\nTransportation and other infrastructure\n\nUrban areas have lower rates of power outages, and much lower rates of fire damage and death.\n\nWhenever there’s a major bridge incident in the US we hear stories about the US’s crumbling infrastructure, but the worst bridges in the US are steadily getting fixed. Between 1992 and 2023, the number of US bridges in critical condition declined by more than 70%.\n\nSimilarly, US interstate quality is improving over time, and US interstates are roughly as good as major highways in other countries.\n\nSan Francisco and Los Angeles have worse roads than any other large US metro.\n\nTunnel boring speed rose at an exponential rate from the early 19th century through the 1950s, but has slowed down since then. If Elon Musk’s Boring Company achieved its speed goals, it would put us back on track to achieve these historical rates of improvement.\n\nNo city grew as fast as Shenzhen in the 20th century, and Chinese cities in general grew faster than anywhere else.\n\nThe US has been an uncompetitive, high-cost shipbuilder since the transition from wood to iron and steel ships in the late 19th century. The Jones Act hasn’t helped this situation, but it’s not the cause of it.\n\nAT&T spent substantially more on telephone infrastructure in the 1960s than NASA spent on the Apollo Program.\n\nModern shipbuilding methods were invented in US shipyards that produced Liberty and Victory ships during WWII.

If improvements are difficult to find, costs might stay high and production volumes stay low even at high learning rates.

In other words, welding robots mostly improved existing automation, rather than automating tasks that had previously been manually done.\n\nIndustrial robots of today aren’t much cheaper than industrial robots from the 1970s in terms of payload capacity, but modern robots are on the order of 50 to 100 times more accurate.\n\nMore Nobel Prize-winning research has been done at Cambridge than at any other university.\n\nBell Labs has done more Nobel Prize-winning work than the next six private corporations combined. Most of its prize-winning work was done by researchers hired after the company invented the transistor, at the peak of its prestige.\n\nThe prestige of Bell Labs inspired several other companies, like Ford, Exxon and Xerox, to fund similar labs that produced basic research uncoupled from concerns of immediate profitability.\n\nMorris Chang began his semiconductor career completely by chance. He originally planned to take a job at Ford, but got so angry at how he was treated when he asked for a higher salary that he took a job at electronics manufacturer Sylvania out of spite.\n\nRocket scientists weren’t the only Germany assets that the US and Russia divided up after WWII. They also each acquired some of Germany’s very large forging presses.\n\nResearch and development programs have generally gotten more expensive over time, but some things have always been pricey. Development costs for a new jet engine, or for a new commercial airliner, have been in the billions of inflation-adjusted dollars since the 1950s and 60s.\n\nNearly every aircraft the US produced in large numbers during WWII started design work before June 1940, more than a year before Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.\n\nMaking a microchip requires thousands of process steps, and a silicon wafer might spend months going through the entire process.\nMy main takeaway from this list of takeaways, and from writing the newsletter more generally, is that there’s almost always more to the story.

At NYU, non-admitted White and Asian students performed marginally and substantially better than Hispanic and Black admitted students, respectively. This could be due to differences in discrimination by the admissions departments, or to other factors like NYU not being the first choice for high-performing Hispanic and Black students as often, and high-performing Whites and Asians having fewer options. Since Columbia is an Ivy League university with a great deal more cachet than NYU, it&#8217;s likely that it&#8217;s the first choice for more people, so they&#8217;re more likely to attract elite students and to leave behind narrower test scores gaps post-selection, and that effect couples with test-optionality biasing Black and Hispanic scores upward.</p><p>With these factors in mind, these results&#8212;though less dramatic at a glance than NYU&#8217;s&#8212;are just as indicting. If we throw in ACT results, the fact that Columbia must be racially discriminating becomes even clearer: <em>rejected Asian students <strong>substantially </strong>outscore admitted Blacks.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"951\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:951,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:245222,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/166755139?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>With more common criteria, the picture becomes much more like NYU&#8217;s, with Columbia clearly rejecting more qualified Whites and Asians than the Hispanics and Blacks they choose to admit. That means White and Asian students tend to have better GPAs, more extracurriculars, and&#8212;quite likely&#8212;better personalities and higher levels of other achievements, as we saw in the <em>SFFA v. Harvard</em> case. Virtually <em>every </em>qualification favors White and Asian students, and yet they&#8217;re still admitted less, at a level not explicable by things like legacy status, athletics and faculty relationships, and so on.</p><p>In other words, Columbia is clearly discriminating. When you try to predict admissions from test scores or GPAs, or a combination thereof, you consistently see that Asian students are underadmitted relative to those academic qualifications. This race interaction effect is large and significant regardless of how you permute the models, and it always indicates that, at the same level of legitimate qualifications, Blacks are more likely to be admitted than Hispanics, who are more likely to be admitted than Whites, who are more likely to be admitted than Asians.</p><p>If race is not considered in admissions and there aren&#8217;t major compensatory factors afoot&#8212;which has never been the case on investigation&#8212;then the model coefficients should not be this way. We know from this data that the gaps shown above should be smaller if offers were made to everyone in order of their qualifications without consideration of race. Race coefficients should all be nonsignificant and small; admissions should be like going down a list in order of academic qualifications and ignoring race, leaving behind no race effect.

Harvard </em>ruling. At best, their demographics change a little bit in the expected direction for people who really are complying, and they seem to expect that to sate the public. But it should not, because they&#8217;re just reducing the magnitude of discrimination, while continuing to engage in it, and that&#8217;s not good enough. <em>SFFA v.

They are aware that test-optionality is abusable, as it makes it harder to check whether other factors are being considered as proxies for race or some other desired demographic characteristic.

      "script_text": "The same hacker responsible for leaking all of the data from New York University’s (NYU’s) admissions department in late March of this year has done it again. This time, they’ve leaked all the data for Columbia. This article will provide a broad overview of what that data shows, and what this means about Columbia’s compliance with the Supreme Court’s ruling in SFFA v. Harvard. Here’s a summary in four words: they did not comply.\n\nFirstly, Columbia remains test-optional. 1 Students are not required to submit test scores, so, as at other schools, less-qualified admits tend to not provide scores. Those who do not provide their scores tend to perform like students who have fairly low scores, earning lower GPAs, flunking out at higher rates, switching to easier majors more readily, and so on.\nWho provides scores more and less often at Columbia? Submissions are shockingly rare, but ordered how you might expect if you’re familiar with educational achievement gaps. Asians submitted test scores more often than Whites, who submitted them more often than Hispanics, who submitted them much more often than Blacks.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis needs to be kept in mind to understand subsequent test score comparisons. The fact that certain groups submit test scores less often makes it so their scores are inflated relative to those who submit their scores more often. The fact that so few submit scores makes it difficult to create an academics-based admissions model, making it harder to determine how Columbia might have biased its admissions process. With that in mind, let’s see SAT scores for admits and students who Columbia didn’t accept:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThese results can be contrasted with the results from NYU in an interesting way. At NYU, non-admitted White and Asian students performed marginally and substantially better than Hispanic and Black admitted students, respectively. This could be due to differences in discrimination by the admissions departments, or to other factors like NYU not being the first choice for high-performing Hispanic and Black students as often, and high-performing Whites and Asians having fewer options. Since Columbia is an Ivy League university with a great deal more cachet than NYU, it’s likely that it’s the first choice for more people, so they’re more likely to attract elite students and to leave behind narrower test scores gaps post-selection, and that effect couples with test-optionality biasing Black and Hispanic scores upward.\nWith these factors in mind, these results—though less dramatic at a glance than NYU’s—are just as indicting. If we throw in ACT results, the fact that Columbia must be racially discriminating becomes even clearer: rejected Asian students substantially outscore admitted Blacks.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nWith more common criteria, the picture becomes much more like NYU’s, with Columbia clearly rejecting more qualified Whites and Asians than the Hispanics and Blacks they choose to admit. That means White and Asian students tend to have better GPAs, more extracurriculars, and—quite likely—better personalities and higher levels of other achievements, as we saw in the SFFA v. Harvard case. Virtually every qualification favors White and Asian students, and yet they’re still admitted less, at a level not explicable by things like legacy status, athletics and faculty relationships, and so on.\nIn other words, Columbia is clearly discriminating. When you try to predict admissions from test scores or GPAs, or a combination thereof, you consistently see that Asian students are underadmitted relative to those academic qualifications. This race interaction effect is large and significant regardless of how you permute the models, and it always indicates that, at the same level of legitimate qualifications, Blacks are more likely to be admitted than Hispanics, who are more likely to be admitted than Whites, who are more likely to be admitted than Asians.\nIf race is not considered in admissions and there aren’t major compensatory factors afoot—which has never been the case on investigation—then the model coefficients should not be this way. We know from this data that the gaps shown above should be smaller if offers were made to everyone in order of their qualifications without consideration of race. Race coefficients should all be nonsignificant and small; admissions should be like going down a list in order of academic qualifications and ignoring race, leaving behind no race effect. And yet, we got a race effect.\nColumbia is still discriminating, and their attempt to suggest otherwise by discriminating somewhat less is just an attempt to cover their behinds.\n\nForce Self-Incrimination\nUniversity after university has only feigned compliance with the SFFA v. Harvard ruling. At best, their demographics change a little bit in the expected direction for people who really are complying, and they seem to expect that to sate the public. But it should not, because they’re just reducing the magnitude of discrimination, while continuing to engage in it, and that’s not good enough. SFFA v. Harvard said to stop discriminating, full-stop.\nSo, how do we stop universities from continuing to violate the law like NYU and Columbia have been doing? Through gathering and releasing more data. The simplest solution to this whole issue is IPEDS Reform.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nIPEDS is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the primary postsecondary education data collection program in the U.S. It’s maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics, and it contains a wealth of data, but it could contain a lot more. Right now, anyone can go access IPEDS and obtain information on student test scores and demographics for different universities alongside a bundle of other interesting pieces of information. But it’s not enough. As noted by the primary researcher in the SFFA case, Peter Arcidiacono:\n\nThe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides information on total applications, admissions, and enrollment for all institutions that participate in federal student aid programs, but does not disaggregate the data by race or SAT score. A simple change in the data collection practices would generate a clearer picture of the role race plays in the admissions process at American colleges and universities, as well as help high school students make more informed decisions about where to apply to college.\nThe President can force IPEDS to enforce data collection standards that will make it unambiguous whether universities like Harvard, NYU, and Columbia are acting in violation of the law. They can go much deeper than merely providing race and sex breakouts, too. Universities should be forced to provide extensive, ideally individual-level data, both for applicants and for attendees, so that a comprehensive picture of the U.S. education system can be pieced together each and every year, and institutions can be appropriately audited with data in hand.\nWhen IPEDS is reformed into a system that forces universities to provide the data that we know they collect internally—from leaks like this, and because we can see it on their applications and in publications—, it will allow independent researchers, auditors, and other officials and interested parties to credibly speak out against violations of the law.

Once it's possible to know discrimination is taking place, it will be known, because parents and interest groups will go and use the data. The universities will become easily punishable and no doubt, in short order, punished.

Maybe you lose funding for all your researchers or all subsidized student loans.\nThis move would pave the way for America's institutions of higher learning to stop promoting the unqualified into America's elite journalistic, scientific, and governmental institutions through racially discriminatory admissions, and to instead promote excellence once again.\n\nI’ll leave it to the hacker to decide how they want to release the data to the public and will update here accordingly.\n1\n\nI added this footnote a few hours after I uploaded the article. It clarifies something explicitly that I thought was clear, but people evidently are not getting:\nTest-optional policies allow universities to mask discrimination.\nI’ve noted here that we can get around this if we have enough data, but usually, we don’t, so we get stuck.

The rise was, it&#8217;s been argued, exaggerated by factors that promote identification without substance.</p><p>There are plenty of examples of false trends in medicine. One common example is &#8220;sepsis&#8221;. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2654187\">A stark rise in sepsis noticed in insurance claims was not supported</a> when looking at the incidence recorded in electronic health records, deaths, or discharges to hospice. The purported &#8216;rise of sepsis&#8217; was due to Medicare incentives to upcode patients and the adoption of other billing practices that raised the number of charts labeled &#8220;sepsis&#8221; without a parallel mortality rise. Similarly, did Lyme disease cases rise 70% in 2022 compared to 2017-19? <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm\">No!</a> Surveillance methods changed because they began allowing certain jurisdictions to start reporting based on laboratory test-based evidence alone, without the need for clinical confirmation. Or, more morbidly, did Sudden Infant Death cases rapidly decline? Yes, but some of this shift was due to diagnostic changes:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"508.65671641791045\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:426,&quot;width&quot;:1005,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:43346,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/166089953?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513373/\">Shapiro-Mendoza et al. 2018, Table 13.2</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Often enough, rapid changes <em>do</em> have a real element. The SIDS example is one such case. But the trend was exaggerated for artefactual reasons. Sometimes trends are entirely real, but due to an abrupt societal response to bad information. For instance, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended parents delay the introduction of peanuts to their kids&#8217; diets until age three. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1926738294710170008\">The LEAP study</a> showed that this advice was exactly backwards, and waiting leads to a <em>higher</em> incidence of peanut allergy.

For example, documented that a large portion of the rise in LGBT identities was due to a rise in identification as bisexual, without much evidence for a corresponding shift in non-heterosexual behavior. The rise was, it’s been argued, exaggerated by factors that promote identification without substance.\nThere are plenty of examples of false trends in medicine. One common example is “sepsis”. A stark rise in sepsis noticed in insurance claims was not supported when looking at the incidence recorded in electronic health records, deaths, or discharges to hospice. The purported ‘rise of sepsis’ was due to Medicare incentives to upcode patients and the adoption of other billing practices that raised the number of charts labeled “sepsis” without a parallel mortality rise. Similarly, did Lyme disease cases rise 70% in 2022 compared to 2017-19? No! Surveillance methods changed because they began allowing certain jurisdictions to start reporting based on laboratory test-based evidence alone, without the need for clinical confirmation. Or, more morbidly, did Sudden Infant Death cases rapidly decline? Yes, but some of this shift was due to diagnostic changes:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nShapiro-Mendoza et al. 2018, Table 13.2\nOften enough, rapid changes do have a real element. The SIDS example is one such case. But the trend was exaggerated for artefactual reasons. Sometimes trends are entirely real, but due to an abrupt societal response to bad information. For instance, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended parents delay the introduction of peanuts to their kids’ diets until age three. The LEAP study showed that this advice was exactly backwards, and waiting leads to a higher incidence of peanut allergy. By the time the AAP reversed course, the damage was done.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nIn the rarest of cases, trend-breaks are due to miracles. Economic liberalization and mass vaccination campaigns are among the few examples of this that come to mind:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMiraculous and abysmal trends are few and far between. The default assumption ought to be this: when something looks too good to be true, it is, and what we’re really seeing is an artefactual change, or perhaps as poor accounting of some data. 1 When the world shocks us—as in the case of Cuba’s “exceptional” healthcare system —it is more likely because we’re being presented with something unreal than that we’re seeing something truly awe-inspiring.\nThe thing that inspired this post was natural disasters. of Our World in Data documented that the frequently-touted four-to-five-fold increase in natural disaster numbers over the past half-century has more to do with the adoption of satellite monitoring, improved communications technology, the spread of the Internet, and intentional and recent efforts to catalogue disasters.

Yes, but some of this shift was due to diagnostic changes:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"508.65671641791045\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:426,&quot;width&quot;:1005,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:43346,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/166089953?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PSh9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F75c62e98-d29c-4eaf-9e68-4a6dd9b5da56_1005x426.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" fetchpriority=\"high\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513373/\">Shapiro-Mendoza et al. 2018, Table 13.2</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Often enough, rapid changes <em>do</em> have a real element. The SIDS example is one such case. But the trend was exaggerated for artefactual reasons. Sometimes trends are entirely real, but due to an abrupt societal response to bad information. For instance, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended parents delay the introduction of peanuts to their kids&#8217; diets until age three. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1926738294710170008\">The LEAP study</a> showed that this advice was exactly backwards, and waiting leads to a <em>higher</em> incidence of peanut allergy.

      "script_text": "This was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. I made the table for this beforehand. You can find my previous timed post here.\n\nWhen a time-series suddenly jumps, plummets, or accelerates, the likeliest cause is a shift in how the phenomenon is measured —its definition, detection technology, reporting incentives, or data coverage—rather than a real-world change in the phenomenon itself. Whenever you see some hard-to-explain trend, it’s more likely to be artefactual than real.\nI’ve compiled an unsystematic sampling of instances of this below. Suggest more and I’ll add them to the table!\n!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"}}}))}();\nI have no doubt that if you spend enough time looking at Twitter ‘data accounts’ in the abstract, you’ll find plenty of instances where the incidence of something changed for reasons that were not real, or which at least didn’t align with what many people were thinking. For example, documented that a large portion of the rise in LGBT identities was due to a rise in identification as bisexual, without much evidence for a corresponding shift in non-heterosexual behavior. The rise was, it’s been argued, exaggerated by factors that promote identification without substance.\nThere are plenty of examples of false trends in medicine. One common example is “sepsis”. A stark rise in sepsis noticed in insurance claims was not supported when looking at the incidence recorded in electronic health records, deaths, or discharges to hospice. The purported ‘rise of sepsis’ was due to Medicare incentives to upcode patients and the adoption of other billing practices that raised the number of charts labeled “sepsis” without a parallel mortality rise. Similarly, did Lyme disease cases rise 70% in 2022 compared to 2017-19? No! Surveillance methods changed because they began allowing certain jurisdictions to start reporting based on laboratory test-based evidence alone, without the need for clinical confirmation. Or, more morbidly, did Sudden Infant Death cases rapidly decline? Yes, but some of this shift was due to diagnostic changes:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nShapiro-Mendoza et al. 2018, Table 13.2\nOften enough, rapid changes do have a real element. The SIDS example is one such case. But the trend was exaggerated for artefactual reasons. Sometimes trends are entirely real, but due to an abrupt societal response to bad information. For instance, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended parents delay the introduction of peanuts to their kids’ diets until age three. The LEAP study showed that this advice was exactly backwards, and waiting leads to a higher incidence of peanut allergy. By the time the AAP reversed course, the damage was done.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nIn the rarest of cases, trend-breaks are due to miracles. Economic liberalization and mass vaccination campaigns are among the few examples of this that come to mind:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMiraculous and abysmal trends are few and far between. The default assumption ought to be this: when something looks too good to be true, it is, and what we’re really seeing is an artefactual change, or perhaps as poor accounting of some data. 1 When the world shocks us—as in the case of Cuba’s “exceptional” healthcare system —it is more likely because we’re being presented with something unreal than that we’re seeing something truly awe-inspiring.\nThe thing that inspired this post was natural disasters. of Our World in Data documented that the frequently-touted four-to-five-fold increase in natural disaster numbers over the past half-century has more to do with the adoption of satellite monitoring, improved communications technology, the spread of the Internet, and intentional and recent efforts to catalogue disasters. To be sure, there may have been a real increase of late, but this data doesn’t provide unequivocal support for it, and indeed, as more disasters have been documented, they’ve tended to become less severe. Part of that hopeful trend might be down to an improved ability to respond to disasters, but a likelier candidate is better reporting. 2\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nFor example, some people like to use poor-quality data to exaggerate the increase in ultraprocessed food consumption, when high-quality data shows a more slight increase in consumption shares over time.\n2\n\nIn case it is not clear, reporting can explain all or part of trends by improving and by getting worse. This instance is just one where the cause is clearly improvement.",

They found that when the mechanisms of different drugs were also implicated in genetic studies, the odds that those drugs would be approved were <em>doubled</em> (OR = 2.1).</p><p>This is <em>very large</em> given the domain. In general, only about 10% of all drugs subjected to the trial process eventually receive FDA approval.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> Going from just under 10% approvals to nearly 20% is a <em>huge </em>change for the industry given <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250508004022/https://trial.medpath.com/news/f9da185685ce1a58/clinical-trial-complexity-drives-30-cost-increase-industry-faces-growing-challenges-in-drug-development\">the enormous cost and complexity</a> of trials.

Furthermore, the more similar the drug was to its genetic counterpart, the greater the odds the drug would be approved, up to a nearly <em>nine-times</em> improvement in approval odds.</p><div

href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07316-0\">Vallabh Minikel et al.</a> added even more data, finding that genetic evidence was associated 2.6-times higher odds of approval. This is an especially powerful finding because <em>so much </em>genetic evidence had been produced by this point from GWASs. At baseline, a huge number of drug targets should have already been incidentally supported for this reason, and indeed, that is something they found. Adding to the other studies, Vallabh Minikel et al. found that genetic evidence could even affect the odds of moving from preclinical studies to real clinical trials.</p><p>Shortly after Vallabh Minikel et al.&#8217;s study, <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.17.24309059v1\">the 23andMe Research Team published their own report on the matter</a>. Was this an attempt to salvage the buying price for 23andMe with bankruptcy looming? Was it the Research Team crying out about mismanagement? Even people within the Team are torn on the motivation for this study, at least when I&#8217;ve asked them. Regardless, their findings are substantial because of how they differed from earlier results.</p><p>Vallabh Minikel et al. had lots of data and produced up-to-date estimates of the impacts of genetic evidence on clinical success. Their paper was no small feat, but it revealed a major weakness: the data they had access to did not leave them with enough statistical power to detect the positive association between the effect sizes of different variants or the inverse of their minor allele frequencies and the odds of clinical success.</p><p>In 23andMe&#8217;s data, they provided evidence that both of these factors influenced drug approval odds. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2732\">Both factors are predicted to do so</a> based on strongly supported genetic theory; the larger the effects and the rarer the variants, the more likely those variants are to be causal and to discretely disrupt a target-relevant function, but Vallabh Minikel et al. still failed to find those effects.</p><p>I&#8217;ve illustrated the comparative results stratified by minor allele frequency like so:<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\"

larger, and they deliver results that are better predicted by theory. Because of this fact, 23andMe&#8217;s data is also more amenable to predicting success. The Research Team knew this and they provided a lot of talk about power in their paper. Moreover, they went on to show that their large dataset allowed for better indication of whether variants were causal&#8212;a key predictor of approval.

With that finding in hand, the true value of the 23andMe platform should be clearer. Not only does 23andMe have a lot of data and not only have they already done a lot of phenotyping of their customers, but they also have a platform that will let them go further, letting them do far more extensive phenotyping of tons of traits. They could even request people go out and get and report medical results to them. That&#8217;s legal!</p><p><em><strong>To review (I)</strong></em>, Regeneron&#8217;s purchase has provided them with the motherlode of data to prioritize drug targets. This greatly increases the odds of success picking drugs that will work when they go to trial. With further growth in and use of the platform, that&#8217;ll only become more true. This supersedes their existing sequencing efforts.</p><h4>Discovery</h4><p>But <em>prioritization </em>is not <em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06388-8\">discovery</a></em>. Actually discovering novel drug targets is more difficult than prioritizing existing ones to focus on as a vetting step before proceeding to clinical trials. Most datasets and biobanks are not set up for doing that, but 23andMe is exceptional. Recall that 23andMe is a platform that allows gathering more data and also that most of the people who use 23andMe <em>have agreed to supply their data for research purposes</em>. Not only that, but many of them <em>would like to</em> supply more data.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>By leveraging its data collection capabilities, it&#8217;s possible to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06540-3\">validate</a> and seek out new drug targets through expansive phenotyping, to provide more support for drug target causality through little-used but highly-informative <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07721-5\">methods following from things like family-based genotyping</a><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, and to contact <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250325125556/https://blog.23andme.com/articles/one-in-ten-lives-with-a-rare-disease\">the roughly 10% of 23andMe customers who have rare diseases and other unusual conditions</a> for <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06388-8\">outright target discovery</a>.</p><p>Most examples of prospective genetically-assisted drug target discovery <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(22)00551-1\">are based on</a> <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd4051\">the identification of people who are unusual</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875213613003434\">For example, PCSK9, a gene that regulates cholesterol metabolism, was discovered as a viable drug target</a> shortly after two gain-of-function mutations were found in a pair of French families that had clinical diagnoses of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) without any mutations in the LDLR or <em>apoB100 </em>genes. After the discovery of PCSK9&#8217;s involvement in cholesterol levels, it was then discovered that two loss-of-function mutations in African Americans (Y142X and C679X) came with major reductions in LDL levels and heart disease risk. Additionally, the R46L loss-of-function mutation found among White people was associated with a somewhat smaller reduction in LDL levels and heart disease risk.</p><p><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/37/17/1341/1748822\">These genetic discoveries led to work</a> on figuring out how to inhibit PCSK9 in humans. That work resulted in PCSK9 inhibitors, which are <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448100\">a successful alternative to statins, with pronounced benefits for those who cannot tolerate statins</a>. I will return to people like these later.</p><p><em><strong>To review (II)</strong></em>, Regeneron has acquired the ability to do target discovery better than anyone else is currently capable of doing. There is precedent for these methods working, but few have had the requisite data and collection platforms to make this possible at scale. Regeneron got those things and we know they want to use them.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Postmarket Preemption</h3><p>Pharmaceutical companies aim to go beyond improving target selection to reduce failure rates&#8212;the main source of costs in drug discovery&#8212;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd4309\">due to drugs lacking efficacy</a>, to also predict their side effect profiles. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2016.184/\">About half of trials fail due to efficacy problems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383522000521\">a further quarter fail due to safety issues</a>, and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4085091\">a bit under 5% of drugs are also eventually withdrawn from the market</a>. By predicting which drugs will fail for safety reasons, companies can prevent lawsuits and costly mistakes introducing compounds to market or trials.</p><p>The ability to and utility of profiling side effects from genetic data has been demonstrated in numerous ways. For example, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09407-3\">Nguyen et al.</a> found that &#8220;the existence of a genetic association between a drug&#8217;s target(s) and phenotypes in a given organ system increases the probability that a side effect will be observed in that organ system during clinical trials.&#8221; Moreover, they found that genetic data can be used to predict side effects in off-indication organs and&#8212;even more importantly&#8212;that when there was genetic support for a drug&#8217;s target affecting other phenotypes but not a particular interrogated phenotype, the rate of side effects observed in the interrogated phenotype is reduced. In other words, &#8220;human genetics provides evidence that can be used to de-risk targets.&#8221;</p><p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1011638\">More recently</a>, &#8220;[side effects] were 2.0 times more likely to occur for drugs whose target possessed human genetic evidence for a trait similar to the [side effect].&#8221; One especially useful finding was that genetic evidence was more powerful when side effects were more common among patients and when they were more severe.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png\" width=\"972\" height=\"1049\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1049,&quot;width&quot;:972,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:141569,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/163939433?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Ybg5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dba85e9-4ca7-4d35-84cf-a8cbd21fadfd_972x1049.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Vallabh Minikel and Nelson 2025, Fig 1C</figcaption></figure></div><p>As with predicting drug trial success, the results were augmented by similarity, this time between the side effect and the trait.

It is likely that characterizing the effects of one characterizes the effects of the other. The effects of statins&#8212;which are based on HMGCR&#8212;and variations in PCSK9 <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.118.034942\">are also highly, but somewhat less, similar</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> To bring the third major LDL-lowering option, ezetimibe (NCP1L1), back into this picture, we can compare it to statins. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.134.suppl_1.17284\">the metabolomic profile of genetic variation in NCP1L1 is effectively identical to the metabolomic profile of genetic variation in HMGCR</a>.</p><p>The important things this exercise suggests are that the side effect profile of gene dosage is similar to the side effect profile of corresponding drugs, and that these particular drugs should be broadly similar. For most purposes, it&#8217;s likely that you&#8217;ll be able to safely generalize from conclusions made about one drug to the others in this class. Regeneron can straightforwardly create this sort of profile or a map of other correlates for many drug targets. From this, they&#8217;ll be better equipped to handle pretrial safety considerations than anyone else.</p><p><em><strong>To review (III)</strong></em>, Regeneron has acquired the data and platform that, when used properly, will allow them to upend the traditional process of drug development, letting them do it more effectively and cheaply, while avoiding costly missteps. They&#8217;ll also be able to ascertain whether most side effect reports are real or erroneous, allowing them to provide cover for their drugs when the public inevitably overreacts to potentially false information, like <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/ozempic-and-muscle-mass\">that GLP-1RAs cause higher bodyfat percentages</a> or <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/6/1777/3914727\">that ezetimibe causes cancer</a>.</p><h4>Repurposing</h4><p>The other big thing that will become available to Regeneron right away is the data required to reliably do repurposing. To use a recent example, Novo Nordisk&#8217;s Ozempic is approved for the management of chronic kidney disease. Anyone working on GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) could&#8217;ve known to pursue this if they leveraged genetic data. Why? Because variation in the GLP1R gene causes lower rates of chronic kidney disease and the effects of variation in GLP1R are similar to the effects of GLP-1RAs.</p><p>Seeing a sizable effect through genetic evidence and knowing that variation in GLP1R or even that GLP-1RAs themselves are safe, running a trial for a costly condition becomes a gambit with a high expected value. Indeed, it&#8217;s likely that Ozempic makes a ton on being prescribed for chronic kidney disease, since it is common and costly and Ozempic helps to treat it while appealing to patients on other dimensions like providing diabetes and weight management.</p><p>The possibility of doing genetically-guided repurposing is problem one of the most readily accessed ways to bring a drug to market for a new indication. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-021-00387-z\">There are many techniques available for doing this</a>, the missing link for doing this at scale has always just been data. Guess who now has data and a platform to collect it?</p><p><em><strong>To review (IV)</strong></em>, Regeneron has positioned themselves in an opportune way to start taking existing drugs and getting them approved for alternative indications that can be highly lucrative to pursue. They can also use this sort of data to provide off-label prescription indications and vetting for doctors and other providers, if they so wish. Doing that can lead to very large increases in prescriptions, as will likely be the case when GLP-1RA generics arrive for diabetes and get prescribed off-label for obesity.</p><h4>Treating Side Effects</h4><p>Turn back to statins. They&#8217;re commonly prescribed and they&#8217;ve saved countless lives, but they were once feared: their story almost tragically ended before it could begin. In their first administration, the Japanese scientists who discovered them got very unlucky by testing them on one of the roughly one-third of people who experience myopathy&#8212;muscular weakness&#8212;when they&#8217;re given. Not only that, but they administered the drug to a woman who was in the even smaller minority for whom the myopathy was severe. She eventually became unable to walk while on the drugs, and statin tests were officially stopped. Luckily, they continued in secret and the discoverers found that they could reliably lower cholesterol levels at low doses, safely and effectively for most people.</p><p>A few decades later, two teams of researchers may have stumbled upon the mechanism behind statin-induced myopathy. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929723001301\">The first team</a> may have found the answer through investigating nine people with serious muscular dystrophy, all but one of whom was discovered to carry missense mutations in the HMGCR gene. That team&#8217;s work was done on unrelated people, but <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2217831120\">the second team&#8217;s</a> research was done on an inbred Bedouin Arab family in Israel. In this family, several of the individuals suffered from the same condition seen by the first team, both phenotypically and seemingly genetically.</p><p>In both studies, the responsible mutations were likely the ones in HMGCR, implicating a critical component of how statins function. Statins operate by inhibiting HMGCR from converting to HMG-CoA to mevalonolactone, and these mutations cut off the conversion to HMG-CoA. The team working with the bedu family decided to act on this information. They started administering one of the affected people a weekly dose of mevalonolactone, the product of HMGCR.</p><p>Within three weeks, she had clearly begun to recover muscular function. She did so without any noticeable bump in cholesterol levels. This experiment was repeated in a mouse model of statin-induced myopathy and it was found that supplementing mevalonolactone had the same effect for mice as it did for their human test subject: <em>no myopathy! </em>The mice that were just given statins couldn&#8217;t hold onto a wire for very long, but the mice who were given the statins and the mevalonolactone were just as strong as they were before therapy began:</p><div class=\"native-video-embed\" data-component-name=\"VideoPlaceholder\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;92f52a4a-30ed-4135-9fcc-de35628108a3&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}\"></div><p>By looking at unusual people and their families, these researchers may have found a treatment for a common side effect of statin use. This could become a standard treatment for people who take statins and suffer from myopathy, potentially helping millions globally to lower their cholesterol safely.</p><p><em><strong>To review (V)</strong></em>, Regeneron is now set up to replicate this scenario for <em>tons </em>of different drugs, many of which <em>do not </em>have alternatives like statins do. Selling the cure for a bad side effect could be extremely lucrative. To find more things like this, Regeneron just has to leverage their ability to contact people effectively. They could even provide people with free sequencing for their families when they&#8217;re using them to potentially make medical discoveries like this one. This paves the way for simple <em>N-</em>of-1 therapies and therapeutic discoveries for the masses based on rare disease findings.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Regulatory Promotion and Easy Trials</h3><p>Now is the right time for a 23andMe purchase. The new Presidential administration has explicitly ordered that regulators deprioritize enforcement actions that stand in the way of technological advances and Regeneron is poised to make <em>many </em>technological advances. At the same time, the administration is pursuing deregulation and reform, and they&#8217;ve signaled an interest in significant overhauls to how clinical trials and cGMP are done in the U.S. These reforms would make trials far less costly.</p><p>Tearing down barriers to patient contact and recruitment alone would put Regeneron in a very good position, because they can now use their platform to find people for trials at a larger scale and more effectively than practically anyone. Recall again just how willing 23andMe participants are to supply medical information, participate in surveys, and so on. No doubt some number of them would even be willing to take part in trials, potentially reducing the compensation issues clinical trials face through selection.</p><p>If America widens its acceptance of overseas data&#8212;as its anti-animal testing plans indicate it should&#8212;then Regeneron will even be able to run trials or trial segments abroad quite cheaply. This is advantageous for them more than for so many others simply because of the number of plausible targets they have available. These vetting tools turn into relatively sure bets and enable fast progress coupled with the changes that are soon to arrive to the regulatory ecosystem.</p><p>All of this is really just the beginning, too. Regeneron is, for many reasons, in a very fortuitous position because of who&#8217;s in office.</p><p>Recall that report on the cost of trials cited by the HHS. It includes a section on estimates of how different strategies and tools can impact the costs and time spent in drug development.</p><p>Where surrogate endpoints are viable, Regeneron can save money with them because their data gathering is simplified and expedited through their platform, and they may have or be able to obtain pre-existing measurements for many things as well. The report estimated using these could save 1-5% on costs and 1-3% on duration depending on trial phase. Having access to and leveraging electronic health records was estimated to save 1-15% on costs and 1-13% on duration, while patient registries were estimated to save between 4 and 8% of costs and 5-8% on time.</p><p>Tech Regeneron has access to now could make their trials<em> </em>and their preclinical work much less costly than the work done by other companies and groups. While these edges may not be huge on their own, they are something, and when we&#8217;re talking proportions of trial costs, these small improvements translate to very meaningful sums in the millions of dollars.</p><p>Regeneron could even provide access to their data and profit from the discoveries that others make for them, if they so desired. Scholars are, after all, more after status than they are money, and for many of them, being able to say they made a discovery is more valuable than the sums they might be able to receive if they were the discovery&#8217;s owner.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Full Package</h3><p>Let&#8217;s go over a sliver of what Regeneron gains from this deal.</p><p>Regeneron gains <em>drug target prioritization capabilities</em>, <em>drug discovery resources</em>, and a <em>phenotyping platform</em>. These are highly sought after prizes in the field, and they are even being pursued by other companies that are less forward-thinking than Regeneron.</p><p>Regeneron gains <em>drug target toxicity prediction capabilities</em>, <em>drug repurposing capabilities</em>, and a <em>side effect treatment discovery modality</em>. Regeneron also gains the ability to directly lower costs associated with preclinical and clinical work in other ways thanks to the acquisition of their new data collection platform and all the attached data.</p><p>In short, Regeneron gains exclusive access to tools for pharmaceutical R&amp;D acceleration at an opportune time. These tools are key parts of the future of pharmaceutical R&amp;D and the industry already knows it. If Regeneron uses them well, they will quickly become the most valuable pharmaceutical company.</p><p>Though I&#8217;ve skipped over a lot of detail and I&#8217;ve left most of my thesis unsaid, I hope that what I&#8217;ve provided you here is enough for you to understand why I predicted that Regeneron would buy 23andMe some five odd years ago.</p><div><hr></div><h3>A Brief Note on Dowsing Rods</h3><p>When someone picks up low-hanging fruit, someone else will come along and ask: if it was so obvious, why wasn&#8217;t anyone already doing it? The answer to this is <em>not </em>always that actions are only obvious in hindsight, because often enough, people genuinely do see what to do long before it&#8217;s actually done.</p><p>The history of the discovery of various drugs is a testament to this: so many advances, from RNA vaccines to GLP-1s, languished in obscurity for a long time. Sometimes drugs were dismissed on the basis of poor negative evidence, and other times, the possibilities for various drugs weren&#8217;t ever going to be reached with a given indication, but another one was sitting there waiting to be used. (The Roivant business model is all about that.) There really <em>is </em>a lot of low-hanging fruit.</p><p>The truth is, lots of people have been trying to do what Regeneron is going to do with 23andMe. You can see this in the form of various pharmaceutical companies contributing to sequencing charities and other efforts&#8212;often for rare diseases, but sometimes for common conditions, too. They contribute funds and occasionally manpower and they get back data, but it&#8217;s still hard to develop the whole pipeline for and from that data, which is gathered slowly, to get a product that makes a return.</p><p>But 23andMe solves this issue by being dual-use. People sign up for 23andMe to access generally vague health information, to learn about their ancestry, and to connect with their family members. Great! We can use their data obtained for that reason to do so much more. 23andMe&#8217;s dual-use nature has resulted in them gathering <em>far more </em>than all other industry genotyping and sequencing efforts.</p><p>That data will be used. 23andMe&#8217;s low-hanging fruit will be harvested, by <strong>Regeneron</strong>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250205084029/https://go.bio.org/rs/490-EHZ-999/images/ClinicalDevelopmentSuccessRates2011_2020.pdf\">This percentage varies across modalities, with newer modalities seeing higher approval rates</a>.

      "script_text": "Yesterday I won some bets that I made almost five years ago.[June 14 update: Maybe I lost this bet. Anne Wojcicki made a counteroffer and now Regeneron is the backup buyer. Article remains unchanged besides this cross-out and note.] These weren’t simple bets like “a different party will hold the Presidency” or “The CCP will be governing China in 2025”. Rather, I made a stack of nineteen bets on America’s pharmaceutical and biotech future with a few friends of mine and I got the first bet on the money with only a few months to spare. If you’ve been paying attention to the news, you may have heard that Regeneron bought 23andMe. As predicted:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nCaveat: Not all of my proposed bets were accepted and there are some below these in another comment that I’m less likely to win. Whatever! That’s neither here nor there. What I really want to say is this:\nWhen someone predicts something unusual five years ahead of time, you should wonder why.\n\nPreclinical Prioritization\nIn mid-2015, Matthew Nelson and colleagues published a groundbreaking paper. They found that when the mechanisms of different drugs were also implicated in genetic studies, the odds that those drugs would be approved were doubled(OR = 2.1).\nThis is very large given the domain. In general, only about 10% of all drugs subjected to the trial process eventually receive FDA approval. 1 Going from just under 10% approvals to nearly 20% is a huge change for the industry given the enormous cost and complexity of trials. Per the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), clinical trials comprise a little over two-thirds of out-of-pocket R&D expenditures, averaging $117.4 million per drug brought to market. 2\nMore critically, the HHS’ report found that, after accounting for capital and failures, the average drug brought to market costs $879.3 million. 3 The importance of prioritizing drug targets that are likely to be approved should make financial sense given these figures: the better the prioritization before trials commence, the higher the savings and the more likely the company investing their precious R&D time and dollars stays afloat.\n“Precious” is perhaps an understatement given the sad state of pharmaceutical R&D:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nSources here\nThis is why the 2019 follow-up by King, Davis and Degner is so important. In that study, they updated the data from Nelson et al. and extended their methods. New data in hand, genetic support was even more strongly related to the likelihood of an approval. This was particularly true when the genetic evidence concerned Mendelian traits and when GWAS associations were linked to coding variants. Furthermore, the more similar the drug was to its genetic counterpart, the greater the odds the drug would be approved, up to a nearly nine-times improvement in approval odds.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nKing, Davis and Degner, Fig 2A\nIn 2024, Vallabh Minikel et al. added even more data, finding that genetic evidence was associated 2.6-times higher odds of approval. This is an especially powerful finding because so much genetic evidence had been produced by this point from GWASs. At baseline, a huge number of drug targets should have already been incidentally supported for this reason, and indeed, that is something they found. Adding to the other studies, Vallabh Minikel et al. found that genetic evidence could even affect the odds of moving from preclinical studies to real clinical trials.\nShortly after Vallabh Minikel et al.’s study, the 23andMe Research Team published their own report on the matter. Was this an attempt to salvage the buying price for 23andMe with bankruptcy looming? Was it the Research Team crying out about mismanagement? Even people within the Team are torn on the motivation for this study, at least when I’ve asked them. Regardless, their findings are substantial because of how they differed from earlier results.\nVallabh Minikel et al. had lots of data and produced up-to-date estimates of the impacts of genetic evidence on clinical success. Their paper was no small feat, but it revealed a major weakness: the data they had access to did not leave them with enough statistical power to detect the positive association between the effect sizes of different variants or the inverse of their minor allele frequencies and the odds of clinical success.\nIn 23andMe’s data, they provided evidence that both of these factors influenced drug approval odds. Both factors are predicted to do so based on strongly supported genetic theory; the larger the effects and the rarer the variants, the more likely those variants are to be causal and to discretely disrupt a target-relevant function, but Vallabh Minikel et al. still failed to find those effects.\nI’ve illustrated the comparative results stratified by minor allele frequency like so: 4\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nWhat these findings indicate is simple and elegant: even today’s massive public datasets are not enough. 23andMe is that much larger, and they deliver results that are better predicted by theory. Because of this fact, 23andMe’s data is also more amenable to predicting success. The Research Team knew this and they provided a lot of talk about power in their paper. Moreover, they went on to show that their large dataset allowed for better indication of whether variants were causal—a key predictor of approval. Not only that, but their power showed up in terms of numbers of findings:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n23andMe Research Team, 2024, Figure 2D\n23andMe has won by virtue of size, but they’ve also won by virtue of another of the paper’s findings: self-reported data works fine! With that finding in hand, the true value of the 23andMe platform should be clearer. Not only does 23andMe have a lot of data and not only have they already done a lot of phenotyping of their customers, but they also have a platform that will let them go further, letting them do far more extensive phenotyping of tons of traits. They could even request people go out and get and report medical results to them. That’s legal!\nTo review (I), Regeneron’s purchase has provided them with the motherlode of data to prioritize drug targets. This greatly increases the odds of success picking drugs that will work when they go to trial. With further growth in and use of the platform, that’ll only become more true. This supersedes their existing sequencing efforts.\nDiscovery\nBut prioritization is not discovery. Actually discovering novel drug targets is more difficult than prioritizing existing ones to focus on as a vetting step before proceeding to clinical trials. Most datasets and biobanks are not set up for doing that, but 23andMe is exceptional. Recall that 23andMe is a platform that allows gathering more data and also that most of the people who use 23andMe have agreed to supply their data for research purposes. Not only that, but many of them would like to supply more data. 5\nBy leveraging its data collection capabilities, it’s possible to validate and seek out new drug targets through expansive phenotyping, to provide more support for drug target causality through little-used but highly-informative methods following from things like family-based genotyping 6, and to contact the roughly 10% of 23andMe customers who have rare diseases and other unusual conditions for outright target discovery.\nMost examples of prospective genetically-assisted drug target discovery are based on the identification of people who are unusual.\nFor example, PCSK9, a gene that regulates cholesterol metabolism, was discovered as a viable drug target shortly after two gain-of-function mutations were found in a pair of French families that had clinical diagnoses of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol) without any mutations in the LDLR or apoB100 genes. After the discovery of PCSK9’s involvement in cholesterol levels, it was then discovered that two loss-of-function mutations in African Americans (Y142X and C679X) came with major reductions in LDL levels and heart disease risk. Additionally, the R46L loss-of-function mutation found among White people was associated with a somewhat smaller reduction in LDL levels and heart disease risk.\nThese genetic discoveries led to work on figuring out how to inhibit PCSK9 in humans. That work resulted in PCSK9 inhibitors, which are a successful alternative to statins, with pronounced benefits for those who cannot tolerate statins. I will return to people like these later.\nTo review (II), Regeneron has acquired the ability to do target discovery better than anyone else is currently capable of doing. There is precedent for these methods working, but few have had the requisite data and collection platforms to make this possible at scale. Regeneron got those things and we know they want to use them.\n\nPostmarket Preemption\nPharmaceutical companies aim to go beyond improving target selection to reduce failure rates—the main source of costs in drug discovery— due to drugs lacking efficacy, to also predict their side effect profiles. About half of trials fail due to efficacy problems, a further quarter fail due to safety issues, and a bit under 5% of drugs are also eventually withdrawn from the market. By predicting which drugs will fail for safety reasons, companies can prevent lawsuits and costly mistakes introducing compounds to market or trials.\nThe ability to and utility of profiling side effects from genetic data has been demonstrated in numerous ways. For example, Nguyen et al. found that “the existence of a genetic association between a drug’s target(s) and phenotypes in a given organ system increases the probability that a side effect will be observed in that organ system during clinical trials.” Moreover, they found that genetic data can be used to predict side effects in off-indication organs and—even more importantly—that when there was genetic support for a drug’s target affecting other phenotypes but not a particular interrogated phenotype, the rate of side effects observed in the interrogated phenotype is reduced. In other words, “human genetics provides evidence that can be used to de-risk targets.”\nMore recently, “[side effects] were 2.0 times more likely to occur for drugs whose target possessed human genetic evidence for a trait similar to the [side effect].” One especially useful finding was that genetic evidence was more powerful when side effects were more common among patients and when they were more severe.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nVallabh Minikel and Nelson 2025, Fig 1C\nAs with predicting drug trial success, the results were augmented by similarity, this time between the side effect and the trait. Armed with this knowledge and the ability to do extensive phenotyping with ease, Regeneron can get a lot more out of side effect prediction than anyone else. But predicting side effect profiles is not all they’re going to be more capable of than peer companies. They’ll also be able to better ascertain carcinogenicity and they can leverage genetic information to conduct cost-effective safety studies and improve monitoring.\nTo make the possibility and utility of side effect profiling clearer, consider a concrete example: the claim that ezetimibe—a statin alternative based on Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein rather than the HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) enzyme targeted by statins—causes cancer. To figure this out, you might need a very large trial with a sample monitored for a long time, or you could use the natural genetic variation in LDL levels provided by individual differences in the NPC1L1 gene. 7\nDifferences in NPC1L1 index differences in lifetime LDL levels in a way that’s equivalent to the lifetime effect of taking ezetimibe at different doses. With data on people with different variants affecting the effect of NPC1L1, we can see that there’s no cancer risk from the drug:\n\nImage: Risk of any cancer, cancer death and ischaemic vascular disease (= positive control) per one-unit increase in NPC1L1 internally or externally weighted allele score, or per one-allele increase in allele count, including either four, three or one genetic variants in the analyses. For cancer and cancer death, Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for age, sex and population. For ischaemic vascular disease, Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for age, sex, population, diabetes, physical activity and hypertension. HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval.\n\n\n\nLauridsen et al. 2017, Figure 2\nWith that concern out of the way, there’s still the question: what if ezetimibe is harmful in some other way? One could argue that statins are better studied and so we know they’re safe, whereas ezetimibe’s safety is a more open question. To answer it, turn first to studies of statins. The metabolic changes associated with starting statin therapy are indistinguishable from the effects associated with variation in the HMGCR gene:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nWürtz et al. 2016, Figure 4\nThe genetic and the pharmacological effects of statins are effectively identical. It is likely that characterizing the effects of one characterizes the effects of the other. The effects of statins—which are based on HMGCR—and variations in PCSK9 are also highly, but somewhat less, similar. 8 To bring the third major LDL-lowering option, ezetimibe (NCP1L1), back into this picture, we can compare it to statins. As it turns out, the metabolomic profile of genetic variation in NCP1L1 is effectively identical to the metabolomic profile of genetic variation in HMGCR.\nThe important things this exercise suggests are that the side effect profile of gene dosage is similar to the side effect profile of corresponding drugs, and that these particular drugs should be broadly similar. For most purposes, it’s likely that you’ll be able to safely generalize from conclusions made about one drug to the others in this class. Regeneron can straightforwardly create this sort of profile or a map of other correlates for many drug targets. From this, they’ll be better equipped to handle pretrial safety considerations than anyone else.\nTo review (III), Regeneron has acquired the data and platform that, when used properly, will allow them to upend the traditional process of drug development, letting them do it more effectively and cheaply, while avoiding costly missteps. They’ll also be able to ascertain whether most side effect reports are real or erroneous, allowing them to provide cover for their drugs when the public inevitably overreacts to potentially false information, like that GLP-1RAs cause higher bodyfat percentages or that ezetimibe causes cancer.\nRepurposing\nThe other big thing that will become available to Regeneron right away is the data required to reliably do repurposing. To use a recent example, Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic is approved for the management of chronic kidney disease. Anyone working on GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) could’ve known to pursue this if they leveraged genetic data. Why? Because variation in the GLP1R gene causes lower rates of chronic kidney disease and the effects of variation in GLP1R are similar to the effects of GLP-1RAs.\nSeeing a sizable effect through genetic evidence and knowing that variation in GLP1R or even that GLP-1RAs themselves are safe, running a trial for a costly condition becomes a gambit with a high expected value. Indeed, it’s likely that Ozempic makes a ton on being prescribed for chronic kidney disease, since it is common and costly and Ozempic helps to treat it while appealing to patients on other dimensions like providing diabetes and weight management.\nThe possibility of doing genetically-guided repurposing is problem one of the most readily accessed ways to bring a drug to market for a new indication. There are many techniques available for doing this, the missing link for doing this at scale has always just been data. Guess who now has data and a platform to collect it?\nTo review (IV), Regeneron has positioned themselves in an opportune way to start taking existing drugs and getting them approved for alternative indications that can be highly lucrative to pursue. They can also use this sort of data to provide off-label prescription indications and vetting for doctors and other providers, if they so wish. Doing that can lead to very large increases in prescriptions, as will likely be the case when GLP-1RA generics arrive for diabetes and get prescribed off-label for obesity.\nTreating Side Effects\nTurn back to statins. They’re commonly prescribed and they’ve saved countless lives, but they were once feared: their story almost tragically ended before it could begin. In their first administration, the Japanese scientists who discovered them got very unlucky by testing them on one of the roughly one-third of people who experience myopathy—muscular weakness—when they’re given. Not only that, but they administered the drug to a woman who was in the even smaller minority for whom the myopathy was severe. She eventually became unable to walk while on the drugs, and statin tests were officially stopped. Luckily, they continued in secret and the discoverers found that they could reliably lower cholesterol levels at low doses, safely and effectively for most people.\nA few decades later, two teams of researchers may have stumbled upon the mechanism behind statin-induced myopathy. The first team may have found the answer through investigating nine people with serious muscular dystrophy, all but one of whom was discovered to carry missense mutations in the HMGCR gene. That team’s work was done on unrelated people, but the second team’s research was done on an inbred Bedouin Arab family in Israel. In this family, several of the individuals suffered from the same condition seen by the first team, both phenotypically and seemingly genetically.\nIn both studies, the responsible mutations were likely the ones in HMGCR, implicating a critical component of how statins function. Statins operate by inhibiting HMGCR from converting to HMG-CoA to mevalonolactone, and these mutations cut off the conversion to HMG-CoA. The team working with the bedu family decided to act on this information. They started administering one of the affected people a weekly dose of mevalonolactone, the product of HMGCR.\nWithin three weeks, she had clearly begun to recover muscular function. She did so without any noticeable bump in cholesterol levels. This experiment was repeated in a mouse model of statin-induced myopathy and it was found that supplementing mevalonolactone had the same effect for mice as it did for their human test subject: no myopathy! The mice that were just given statins couldn’t hold onto a wire for very long, but the mice who were given the statins and the mevalonolactone were just as strong as they were before therapy began:\n\nBy looking at unusual people and their families, these researchers may have found a treatment for a common side effect of statin use. This could become a standard treatment for people who take statins and suffer from myopathy, potentially helping millions globally to lower their cholesterol safely.\nTo review (V), Regeneron is now set up to replicate this scenario for tons of different drugs, many of which do not have alternatives like statins do. Selling the cure for a bad side effect could be extremely lucrative. To find more things like this, Regeneron just has to leverage their ability to contact people effectively. They could even provide people with free sequencing for their families when they’re using them to potentially make medical discoveries like this one. This paves the way for simple N- of-1 therapies and therapeutic discoveries for the masses based on rare disease findings.\n\nRegulatory Promotion and Easy Trials\nNow is the right time for a 23andMe purchase. The new Presidential administration has explicitly ordered that regulators deprioritize enforcement actions that stand in the way of technological advances and Regeneron is poised to make many technological advances. At the same time, the administration is pursuing deregulation and reform, and they’ve signaled an interest in significant overhauls to how clinical trials and cGMP are done in the U.S. These reforms would make trials far less costly.\nTearing down barriers to patient contact and recruitment alone would put Regeneron in a very good position, because they can now use their platform to find people for trials at a larger scale and more effectively than practically anyone. Recall again just how willing 23andMe participants are to supply medical information, participate in surveys, and so on. No doubt some number of them would even be willing to take part in trials, potentially reducing the compensation issues clinical trials face through selection.\nIf America widens its acceptance of overseas data—as its anti-animal testing plans indicate it should—then Regeneron will even be able to run trials or trial segments abroad quite cheaply. This is advantageous for them more than for so many others simply because of the number of plausible targets they have available. These vetting tools turn into relatively sure bets and enable fast progress coupled with the changes that are soon to arrive to the regulatory ecosystem.\nAll of this is really just the beginning, too. Regeneron is, for many reasons, in a very fortuitous position because of who’s in office.\nRecall that report on the cost of trials cited by the HHS. It includes a section on estimates of how different strategies and tools can impact the costs and time spent in drug development.\nWhere surrogate endpoints are viable, Regeneron can save money with them because their data gathering is simplified and expedited through their platform, and they may have or be able to obtain pre-existing measurements for many things as well. The report estimated using these could save 1-5% on costs and 1-3% on duration depending on trial phase. Having access to and leveraging electronic health records was estimated to save 1-15% on costs and 1-13% on duration, while patient registries were estimated to save between 4 and 8% of costs and 5-8% on time.\nTech Regeneron has access to now could make their trials and their preclinical work much less costly than the work done by other companies and groups. While these edges may not be huge on their own, they are something, and when we’re talking proportions of trial costs, these small improvements translate to very meaningful sums in the millions of dollars.\nRegeneron could even provide access to their data and profit from the discoveries that others make for them, if they so desired. Scholars are, after all, more after status than they are money, and for many of them, being able to say they made a discovery is more valuable than the sums they might be able to receive if they were the discovery’s owner.\n\nThe Full Package\nLet’s go over a sliver of what Regeneron gains from this deal.\nRegeneron gains drug target prioritization capabilities, drug discovery resources, and a phenotyping platform. These are highly sought after prizes in the field, and they are even being pursued by other companies that are less forward-thinking than Regeneron.\nRegeneron gains drug target toxicity prediction capabilities, drug repurposing capabilities, and a side effect treatment discovery modality. Regeneron also gains the ability to directly lower costs associated with preclinical and clinical work in other ways thanks to the acquisition of their new data collection platform and all the attached data.\nIn short, Regeneron gains exclusive access to tools for pharmaceutical R&D acceleration at an opportune time. These tools are key parts of the future of pharmaceutical R&D and the industry already knows it. If Regeneron uses them well, they will quickly become the most valuable pharmaceutical company.\nThough I’ve skipped over a lot of detail and I’ve left most of my thesis unsaid, I hope that what I’ve provided you here is enough for you to understand why I predicted that Regeneron would buy 23andMe some five odd years ago.\n\nA Brief Note on Dowsing Rods\nWhen someone picks up low-hanging fruit, someone else will come along and ask: if it was so obvious, why wasn’t anyone already doing it? The answer to this is not always that actions are only obvious in hindsight, because often enough, people genuinely do see what to do long before it’s actually done.\nThe history of the discovery of various drugs is a testament to this: so many advances, from RNA vaccines to GLP-1s, languished in obscurity for a long time. Sometimes drugs were dismissed on the basis of poor negative evidence, and other times, the possibilities for various drugs weren’t ever going to be reached with a given indication, but another one was sitting there waiting to be used. (The Roivant business model is all about that.) There really is a lot of low-hanging fruit.\nThe truth is, lots of people have been trying to do what Regeneron is going to do with 23andMe. You can see this in the form of various pharmaceutical companies contributing to sequencing charities and other efforts—often for rare diseases, but sometimes for common conditions, too. They contribute funds and occasionally manpower and they get back data, but it’s still hard to develop the whole pipeline for and from that data, which is gathered slowly, to get a product that makes a return.\nBut 23andMe solves this issue by being dual-use. People sign up for 23andMe to access generally vague health information, to learn about their ancestry, and to connect with their family members. Great! We can use their data obtained for that reason to do so much more. 23andMe’s dual-use nature has resulted in them gathering far more than all other industry genotyping and sequencing efforts.\nThat data will be used. 23andMe’s low-hanging fruit will be harvested, by Regeneron. 9\n1\n\nThis percentage varies across modalities, with newer modalities seeing higher approval rates. Problematically, newer modalities also see more withdrawals and safety concerns.\n2\n\nThis report also summarizes ways that the FDA can go about reducing costs substantially, as I detail in the fourth section.\n3\n\nAs noted in the associated JAMA Network Open article from the group that produced this report for the HHS, there are several published cost estimates that are in the billions. These tend to use industry figures and it’s questionable whether they’re more or less accurate, but that’s immaterial since costs are still exorbitant in all estimates.\n4\n\nStratifying by minor allele frequency is similar to stratifying by effect size given the two quantities are so well-correlated. This has proven to be true for many traits, including educational attainment, autism and schizophrenia, BMI-adjusted waist-to-hip ratio, height, IQ, and much more. A stylized graph of this might look like so:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nToma 2020, Figure 1\nNotably, many papers have found that common and rare variants converge on the same mechanisms. Curing a person by targeting their rare causes can readily lead to a drug that works for many more people.\n5\n\nThis ascertainment bias generated through selection into being included in the dataset can bias GWAS associations, but this is not a major worry and it can be alleviated through providing free and compensated testing and platform usage. Efforts can also be made to reduce the impacts of errors in self-reports to further improve the quality of data.\n6\n\nThe power for fine-mapping is usually very low, but 23andMe provides the exceptional opportunity to do it with high power. This means much larger odds that they’ll be able to ascertain causal variants correctly, providing them with even greater opportunity than competitors have to prioritize drug targets.\n7\n\nI love papers that leverage natural genetic variation to understand lifetime drug effects. For example, this paper showed that substantial, lifelong LDL suppression provided a three-fold greater reduction in the risk of heart disease compared to statin-based treatment started later in life. This finding made it into the European Atherosclerosis Society’s consensus statement that LDL causes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\nIf you’re interested in the LDL topic more generally, I recommend this meta-analysis. If you’re interested in learning more about ezetimibe, I recommend this on its tolerability for the statin intolerant, this on a little bit of its history, and this on its efficacy among people with familial hypercholesterolemia.\n8\n\nAnd perhaps even less similar to the effects of genetically-predicted PCSK9.\n9\n\nP.S. many former employees have informed me that they were aware that there were tons of easy wins that were stopped from being gathered by poor management. I’ve been reminded of this repeatedly by current and former employees, for years. Hopefully the ones that remained at 23andMe and the ones who went to Regeneron can now be vindicated.",

The key thing to remember about all this, however, is that there does not appear to have been a rebound in diagnoses. Typically-cited data remains delayed by several years, but nevertheless, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-abstract/117/3/507/7765196\">the expected rebounding that should have taken place in 2021 apparently did not occur</a>. I return to the question of rebounding below.</p><p>Thus far, I&#8217;ve only mentioned diagnoses. Diagnoses are an important bellwether, but they are not enough because there are very many reasons why they might trend. To really understand cancer trends, we have to look at two other factors. Namely:</p><ol><li><p>Disability</p></li><li><p>Death</p></li></ol><p>Let&#8217;s start with disability. Cancer treatment is grueling. If drugs could only be approved on the basis of safety rather than a mixture of safety and efficacy, then cancer drugs would almost never be approved. While most frontline options do work to help people live longer and even cure their disease, they generally do so at great cost to health. Everyone knows about chemotherapy making people bald, brittle, and bony, but such is the cost of survival.</p><p>If the incidence of cancer has increased, and treatment has risen with it, then it stands to reason more people might end up debilitated not just by the disease, but by the treatments for it. Using data from <a href=\"https://jogh.org/2024/jogh-14-04144\">the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019</a>, we can answer in the negative: <em>disability&#8212;quantified by disability-adjusted life years or DALYs&#8212;has not increased among the young. </em>I&#8217;ll illustrate this in two ways. The first is to look at total cancer-related DALYs per 100,000 in high-income countries.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800.2747252747253\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:260287,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/165077586?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!b8Sb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8ceaeac9-4b62-4b5d-8f0a-5d4a70aabf84_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A quick glance at this graph shows a worsening situation for every group <em>except </em>the youngest, whose DALYs have declined from 9.99 in 1990 to 6.73 in 2019.

This is true in <a href=\"https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-024-01640-8\">the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021</a> as well, where the age-standardized incidence rate rose 4.1% between 1990 and 2021, while the age-standardized death rate fell 24.1% between 1980 and 2021.</p><div><hr></div><p>In short, <em>there is no early-onset cancer epidemic</em>. Early-onset cancers are being diagnosed somewhat more often but are still rare in absolute terms, while disabling people less often, and killing far fewer people on a per capita basis than they once did. Hype has distracted from recent, positive trends.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What About Specific Cancers?</h3><p>The general prognosis for cancer among the young is good and it has improved significantly over time, but one could make the case that while this is true in general, the case for particular cancers is becoming much worse. There is something to this concern, but it has to be tempered. I&#8217;ll provide a few examples and some thoughts to chew over.</p><h4>Thyroids, Melanomas, and Other Cautionary Tales</h4><p>Melanoma is common, well-known, and generally comes with a good prognosis&#8212; especially if it&#8217;s noticed early. <a href=\"https://ebm.bmj.com/content/29/3/156\">The adjusted lifetime risk of developing a melanoma increased substantially for American Whites between 1975 and 2018</a>, despite declining time spent outdoors. For men, this increase was a doubling from 3.2% to 6.4%, and for women, it was a near-trebling from 1.6% to 4.5%. Melanoma diagnosed <em>in situ</em>&#8212;meaning an early-stage diagnosis confined to its original site and without spread&#8212;also increased substantially, from 0.17% to 2.7% for men and 0.08% to 2.0% for women.</p><p>Alarm bells should be going off. The distribution of melanoma diagnoses shifted from one marked by relatively few of the less severe, <em>in situ </em>variety of diagnosis, to one where some 79% of the growth for men and 66% of the growth for women was due to just that. Given its apparently declining severity, melanoma has very likely been undergoing a trend towards <em>overdiagnosis</em>. That is, the incidence has increased, without an accompanying spike in mortality as our predilection for diagnosis, our concerns about lumps, our understanding of what&#8217;s a freckle and what&#8217;s a cancerous growth, and our desire to bill for <em>pro forma </em>excisions at first sight, have all increased. Or in the words of the study&#8217;s lead author, we&#8217;ve witnessed a move towards overdiagnosis in the sense of &#8220;the diagnosis of cancers that meet the pathological definition for cancer but are not destined to cause harm&#8212;even if left untreated.&#8221;</p><p>The evidence for overdiagnosis is not just based on the change in the types of melanoma being diagnosed. It also comes from facts like the mortality rate remaining flat over a period in which incidence rose multiple times over, and the attendant fact that, until 2011, treatment barely changed and until 2014, the effects of improved treatment were barely able to make a dent. Since treatment should make a difference when well-targeted, that it fails to do much in real-world settings suggests it&#8217;s being applied to many cases that are insufficiently severe. In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2789995\">an earlier study on the same topic</a>, different methods found similar conclusions: no matter how you slice it, melanoma is increasingly overdiagnosed.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>The pattern observed in the case of melanoma is a common one, and whenever you see it, you can infer that other types of cancer are likewise being overdiagnosed. Just because there&#8217;s a lump does not imply it will become debilitating or lethal, but we&#8217;ve become more likely to be aware and to treat anyway. That&#8217;s simple, so remember it.</p><p>If you return to the graphs in the first section, you&#8217;ll see that the melanoma-like pattern does not apply in the case of early-onset and other cancers, for which mortality isn&#8217;t flat but is instead falling, and for which incidence is either flat or marginally increasing. In those cases, we&#8217;re not <em>entirely</em> seeing overdiagnosis. In the general case, we may well be seeing increased diagnosis pushing down death rates. On the other hand, the lack of a post-COVID rebound in diagnoses and deaths suggests that we still need to be concerned about overdiagnosis since pushing down diagnoses did not translate to an abrupt increase in death and disability. But more time needs to pass to fully understand how this observation will hold up, so I digress.</p><p>The WHO recently highlighted another case of overdiagnosis, but <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(20)30401-0/abstract\">this on is</a> focused on children and adolescents rather than adults. The researchers behind this work observed that thyroid cancer in those aged 0-19 was rare prior to about 2000, after which incidence began to skyrocket. The evidence that this reflected overdiagnosis was a few-fold.</p><p>For one, the features of thyroid cancer observed among youngsters were similar to those observed in adults&#8212;and not just in terms of incidence&#8212;, for whom we know overdiagnosis is important. How do we know overdiagnosis is important for adults? Because of the melanoma pattern: for adults, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncpendmet0236\">diagnoses are being driven by a relatively nonlethal variety of thyroid cancer&#8212;small papillary carcinomas&#8212;and mortality rates have remained low and stable</a>, or even declined somewhat in most places. The incidence is certainly up, but the mortality rates are flat.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"513.4615384615385\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:623,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:271944,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/165077586?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0ZKO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F00ffa596-ecfb-4f7f-bb56-592191a0b379_2394x1025.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Vaccarella et al. 2021, Figure 4</figcaption></figure></div><p>For two, increased levels and quality of surveillance of the thyroid gland are a known phenomenon. New <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/17/9/1429\">diagnostic procedures like neck ultrasonography</a> have made detection of smaller and smaller, and less and less clinically significant cancers more possible than ever before. The number of indolent, nonlethal tumors known to exist in people of all ages without consequence is being met with higher detection and resultingly more surgeries to remove them.</p><p>For three, diagnosis rates appear to be greater in healthcare settings that are more poorly regulated. What this speaks to is that providers may be financially incentivized to diagnose. It makes them money, but this diagnosis can have devastating, lifelong consequences for the patient. The consequences of the surgery or radioactive iodine treatment&#8212;which are preferred to untreated, active surveillance for little good reason&#8212;are often having to go on lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy and suffering through vast reductions in quality of life because the therapy fails to match the quality of having a functioning thyroid.</p><p>There are bountiful other examples of increasingly overdiagnosed cancers that may actually be causing harm via their recognition. Many overdiagnosed cancers are tied to discrete changes in diagnostic practice or technology availability. For example, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11060-013-1212-5\">childhood brain tumor incidence between 1973 and 2009 is marked by stability after the mid-1980s, but during the years in which MRIs were introduced (1983-87), there was a rapid, 53% increase in incidence</a>. Changes in classification, registration, and coding have also affected rates for and diagnosed types of childhood brain tumors. Keep in mind that, as shown above, mortality declined across the childhood brain tumor category.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><p>Similar findings have been made for pancreatic and kidney cancer, hematologic cancers, and more. In short, there is considerable risk of overdiagnosis, even among the young. There is also evidence for improved diagnosis that saves lives but increases apparent incidence, and there is also a staggeringly increasing burden derived from obesity and other chronic diseases wrapped up with obesity. However, despite the growing burden of obesity-related cancers, they have not resulted in the trend towards declining death rates across all early-onset cancers being reversed.</p><h4>Colorectal Cancer: We Have A Preventative. Why Aren&#8217;t We Using It?</h4><p>Early-onset colorectal cancer is exceptional. Its incidence has been steadily rising since 1998 in both sexes among those aged 20-49. At the same time, mortality rates from colorectal cancer have stagnated in the case of women and increased slightly after about 2005 in the case of men.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"629.6703296703297\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:764,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KxN0!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae3b3f75-20c4-4802-bd10-21e5bc485f52_1536x806.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250404035808/https://hcrl.wustl.edu/colon-cancer-rates-increasing-among-younger-people/\">iHeard STL, 2025</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>This recent increase is a cause for <em>some </em>alarm, but its scale should be contextualized before continuing to discuss it.

These links complicate figuring out what exactly the contributions of each of the known factors are to the overall rise. However, their contributions alongside other factors like metabolic syndrome, ulcerative colitis, chronic kidney disease, and so on, at least seem to be <em>large</em>, and thankfully, they are now virtually all indirectly or directly addressable through pharmacotherapy and surgery.</p><p>For example, hyperlipidemia is now able to be safely addressed with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1925373240806924566\">This can be done without problem from a young age</a>. But <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1925357642697879552\">genetic evidence</a> suggests it will not help us in our quest to address early-onset cancers. That genetic evidence shows that cholesterol levels do not contribute to the risk of the broad category of all cancers. If this holds for colorectal cancer specifically, then that provides public health authorities with information they can use to &#8216;look elsewhere&#8217; and provide advice that&#8217;s likely to help rather than waste.</p><p>But obesity <em>does </em>play a causal role in early-onset colorectal cancers and many other ones, and we have an effective treatment for obesity now.

Moreover, young people usually report having <em>multiple </em>symptoms before they&#8217;re diagnosed, with a majority mentioning that after identifying that they had serious symptoms, they adopted a &#8216;wait-and-see&#8217; attitude before pursuing medical care.</p><p>To make the situation with early-onset colorectal cancer identification worse, it&#8217;s so unusual to get it at a young age, that doctors frequently put up roadblocks for patients.

The more costly possibility is lowering the standard age at which screenings begin and advancing the use of less invasive screenings like fecal occult blood tests and sigmoidoscopies.</p><p>Without any effort to engage in a formal cost-benefit analysis, I suspect that informational campaigning would yield more favorable returns than greatly expanding screening. While the latter may lead to more cases identified and lives saved, it&#8217;s tremendously more expensive for a condition that is <em>still very rare </em>in the age groups being discussed.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Quick Question and Answer</h3><p><em>Is there an early-onset cancer epidemic?</em></p><p>When an epidemic is defined by a large absolute increase in early-onset cancers, the big picture answer is &#8220;no&#8221;.</p><p><em>But are more young people diagnosed with cancers than they used to be?</em></p><p>Incidence trends are mostly flat or slightly increasing, with notable increases still being limited in number and scale. Broadly-speaking, diagnostic trends are driven more by changes in identification and diagnostic practice than they are by genuine increases in incidence at a given severity level, and <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1032749/full\">an increase in obesity-related cancers</a> has eclipsed any increase in non-obesity-related cancers.</p><p><em>Are more young people being crippled by cancer than before?</em></p><p>No, age-specific DALYs are down, and this is true for the young as well as the old. However, due to increasing rates of overdiagnosis, more young people <em>are</em> being harmed by having their cancers identified.</p><p><em>Are more young people being killed by cancer than before?</em></p><p>No, age-specific death rates are down, and this is true for the young as well as the old.</p><p><em>What&#8217;s up with early-onset colorectal cancer incidence?</em></p><p>Colorectal cancer is almost the only major cancer to seriously buck the pleasant trend seen for most other cancers afflicting the young. The explanation for its rise is partly obesity, which we can now address cheaply and efficient, and so we should now do that. The scale of and source for the residual component of the rise is unclear, but it is notable that it has not been credibly linked to any known toxicants.</p><p><em>What&#8217;s up with the early-onset colorectal cancer mortality trends?</em></p><p>The answer to this question ought to be largely that it is a natural outgrowth of heightened incidence. More practically, the rise has a lot to do with slow updates to potentially outdated standards of care.</p><p>The health system has failed to move rapidly to update towards giving colorectal cancer-related advice to the young and towards giving providers the advice to enhance screening levels for the young. As such, when colorectal cancer is detected among young people, it is generally far more severe than it should have been had people been more careful and acknowledged their symptoms when they occurred. These cancers are also more severe than they would have been compared to the world in which providers are more willing to perform colonoscopies or engage in other diagnostic and preventative procedures with young patients.</p><p>Because of the still absolutely low rates of colorectal cancers in the young, the debatable efficacy of available screening methods, and the high cost of said screenings, it is not clear whether expanding the standard of care to encourage screening at lower ages would pass muster in a formal cost-benefit analysis.</p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For reference, the obesity-related cancers were esophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct, pancreatic, corpus uterine, ovarian, kidney, thyroid, and multiple myeloma, whereas the non-obesity-related cancers were lip, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, lung, melanoma of skin, Kaposi sarcoma, breast, cervix uterine, prostate, testis, bladder, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.</p><p>Early-onset breast cancer was classified as non-obesity-related despite postmenopausal breast cancer being obesity-related because the sample was defined to be young enough that menopause was uncommon, and thus the cancers would&#8217;ve been premenopausal in large part.

The way these work is that if it takes me more than two hours to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here.\n\nAfter about 2000, different sources started to agree that the incidence of many common types of cancers had begun increasing. For early-onset cancers (diagnosed in ages 20-49), the increase in high-income countries looked like this between 2000 and 2010:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nTrends in obesity-related cancers were far more dramatic for both sexes than were trends in non-obesity-related cancers. 1 For males, there was no aggregate increase in cancers not related to obesity, and obesity-related cancers increased by an average of 3% per year from the low base rates associated with early-onset cancer. For females, the incidence of both types of cancer increased, but non-obesity-related cancers only went up 1% per annum and obesity-related ones went up 7.4 times more rapidly in percentage terms; in absolute terms, the increase for females was almost four times as dramatic for obesity-related cancers.\nTrends are not exactly cut-and-dry, however. This is how early-onset diagnostic trends look in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nLedford 2024\nWith the disruptions to healthcare provisioning brought on by the COVID pandemic, these projections did not hold up: more and more people began avoiding diagnosis, and the naïve view suggested that cancer was declining. But remember, this is just a disruption to diagnoses, not a break in the underlying incidence of cancer. The key thing to remember about all this, however, is that there does not appear to have been a rebound in diagnoses. Typically-cited data remains delayed by several years, but nevertheless, the expected rebounding that should have taken place in 2021 apparently did not occur. I return to the question of rebounding below.\nThus far, I’ve only mentioned diagnoses. Diagnoses are an important bellwether, but they are not enough because there are very many reasons why they might trend. To really understand cancer trends, we have to look at two other factors. Namely:\n\nDisability\n\nDeath\nLet’s start with disability. Cancer treatment is grueling. If drugs could only be approved on the basis of safety rather than a mixture of safety and efficacy, then cancer drugs would almost never be approved. While most frontline options do work to help people live longer and even cure their disease, they generally do so at great cost to health. Everyone knows about chemotherapy making people bald, brittle, and bony, but such is the cost of survival.\nIf the incidence of cancer has increased, and treatment has risen with it, then it stands to reason more people might end up debilitated not just by the disease, but by the treatments for it. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, we can answer in the negative: disability—quantified by disability-adjusted life years or DALYs—has not increased among the young. I’ll illustrate this in two ways. The first is to look at total cancer-related DALYs per 100,000 in high-income countries.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nA quick glance at this graph shows a worsening situation for every group except the youngest, whose DALYs have declined from 9.99 in 1990 to 6.73 in 2019. This seemingly answers our question, but it leaves behind an overall picture that’s quite dismal. But it is not so, for a simple reason: compositional change. I’ve previously discussed this issue in the context of education and IQ scores, but if you don’t want to go read all that, don’t fret, because I’ll make this simple: the picture here is actually quite nice when we quantify it our second way, by assessing the joint effects of population aging, population growth, and changes in age-specific DALYs.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAging and growth are benign causes of an increase in DALYs. For the federal government, increasing DALYs are a fiscal challenge, but from the perspective of its its health authorities, they are merely facts to be recognized and for research priorities to be built around, but not things to get especially worried over.\nWe now have our answer on disability—it’s generally falling across ages, while DALYs rise in total because the population is growing and people are getting older at a rapid rate—so it’s time we moved on to the more morbid and concerning topic of death. The story for early-onset cancer deaths is, once again, seemingly not all that alarming:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nLedford 2024\nThe story here is complicated—as in the case of DALYs—by the fact that the population has grown. Deaths from early-onset cancers may be down per 100,000 persons, of which the rates have been somewhat flat, but the number of people getting these has skyrocketed as the global population has done so. The increase in global early-onset cancer deaths between 1990 and 2019 is 28% versus global population increasing 47% in the same period.\nMore to the point, in America, Britain, and Germany, cancers for children have declined precipitously. Focusing in on the U.S., the total cancer death rate for those aged 0-4 was down 29.8% between 2001 and 2021. For those aged 5-9, it fell a similar 29.9%, while for kids aged 10-14, it fell 14.7%, but that was 17.6% between 2001 and 2011, so there was some nonsignificant reversion—remember, base rates for childhood cancer are very low. Finally, for youths aged 15-19, the rate fell 23.2% between 2001 and 2021.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nA more general picture of cancer death rates provides an estimate that’s further from what we’re looking for, but one which should nevertheless help inform our thinking about cancer deaths.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAcross various sources, the picture for incidence is a largely flat or slightly increasing one while the picture for deaths is a mostly joyful one. This is true in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 as well, where the age-standardized incidence rate rose 4.1% between 1990 and 2021, while the age-standardized death rate fell 24.1% between 1980 and 2021.\n\nIn short, there is no early-onset cancer epidemic. Early-onset cancers are being diagnosed somewhat more often but are still rare in absolute terms, while disabling people less often, and killing far fewer people on a per capita basis than they once did. Hype has distracted from recent, positive trends.\n\nWhat About Specific Cancers?\nThe general prognosis for cancer among the young is good and it has improved significantly over time, but one could make the case that while this is true in general, the case for particular cancers is becoming much worse. There is something to this concern, but it has to be tempered. I’ll provide a few examples and some thoughts to chew over.\nThyroids, Melanomas, and Other Cautionary Tales\nMelanoma is common, well-known, and generally comes with a good prognosis— especially if it’s noticed early. The adjusted lifetime risk of developing a melanoma increased substantially for American Whites between 1975 and 2018, despite declining time spent outdoors. For men, this increase was a doubling from 3.2% to 6.4%, and for women, it was a near-trebling from 1.6% to 4.5%. Melanoma diagnosed in situ —meaning an early-stage diagnosis confined to its original site and without spread—also increased substantially, from 0.17% to 2.7% for men and 0.08% to 2.0% for women.\nAlarm bells should be going off. The distribution of melanoma diagnoses shifted from one marked by relatively few of the less severe, in situ variety of diagnosis, to one where some 79% of the growth for men and 66% of the growth for women was due to just that. Given its apparently declining severity, melanoma has very likely been undergoing a trend towards overdiagnosis. That is, the incidence has increased, without an accompanying spike in mortality as our predilection for diagnosis, our concerns about lumps, our understanding of what’s a freckle and what’s a cancerous growth, and our desire to bill for pro forma excisions at first sight, have all increased. Or in the words of the study’s lead author, we’ve witnessed a move towards overdiagnosis in the sense of “the diagnosis of cancers that meet the pathological definition for cancer but are not destined to cause harm—even if left untreated.”\nThe evidence for overdiagnosis is not just based on the change in the types of melanoma being diagnosed. It also comes from facts like the mortality rate remaining flat over a period in which incidence rose multiple times over, and the attendant fact that, until 2011, treatment barely changed and until 2014, the effects of improved treatment were barely able to make a dent. Since treatment should make a difference when well-targeted, that it fails to do much in real-world settings suggests it’s being applied to many cases that are insufficiently severe. In an earlier study on the same topic, different methods found similar conclusions: no matter how you slice it, melanoma is increasingly overdiagnosed. 2\nThe pattern observed in the case of melanoma is a common one, and whenever you see it, you can infer that other types of cancer are likewise being overdiagnosed. Just because there’s a lump does not imply it will become debilitating or lethal, but we’ve become more likely to be aware and to treat anyway. That’s simple, so remember it.\nIf you return to the graphs in the first section, you’ll see that the melanoma-like pattern does not apply in the case of early-onset and other cancers, for which mortality isn’t flat but is instead falling, and for which incidence is either flat or marginally increasing. In those cases, we’re not entirely seeing overdiagnosis. In the general case, we may well be seeing increased diagnosis pushing down death rates. On the other hand, the lack of a post-COVID rebound in diagnoses and deaths suggests that we still need to be concerned about overdiagnosis since pushing down diagnoses did not translate to an abrupt increase in death and disability. But more time needs to pass to fully understand how this observation will hold up, so I digress.\nThe WHO recently highlighted another case of overdiagnosis, but this on is focused on children and adolescents rather than adults. The researchers behind this work observed that thyroid cancer in those aged 0-19 was rare prior to about 2000, after which incidence began to skyrocket. The evidence that this reflected overdiagnosis was a few-fold.\nFor one, the features of thyroid cancer observed among youngsters were similar to those observed in adults—and not just in terms of incidence—, for whom we know overdiagnosis is important. How do we know overdiagnosis is important for adults? Because of the melanoma pattern: for adults, diagnoses are being driven by a relatively nonlethal variety of thyroid cancer—small papillary carcinomas—and mortality rates have remained low and stable, or even declined somewhat in most places. The incidence is certainly up, but the mortality rates are flat.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nVaccarella et al. 2021, Figure 4\nFor two, increased levels and quality of surveillance of the thyroid gland are a known phenomenon. New diagnostic procedures like neck ultrasonography have made detection of smaller and smaller, and less and less clinically significant cancers more possible than ever before. The number of indolent, nonlethal tumors known to exist in people of all ages without consequence is being met with higher detection and resultingly more surgeries to remove them.\nFor three, diagnosis rates appear to be greater in healthcare settings that are more poorly regulated. What this speaks to is that providers may be financially incentivized to diagnose. It makes them money, but this diagnosis can have devastating, lifelong consequences for the patient. The consequences of the surgery or radioactive iodine treatment—which are preferred to untreated, active surveillance for little good reason—are often having to go on lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy and suffering through vast reductions in quality of life because the therapy fails to match the quality of having a functioning thyroid.\nThere are bountiful other examples of increasingly overdiagnosed cancers that may actually be causing harm via their recognition. Many overdiagnosed cancers are tied to discrete changes in diagnostic practice or technology availability. For example, childhood brain tumor incidence between 1973 and 2009 is marked by stability after the mid-1980s, but during the years in which MRIs were introduced (1983-87), there was a rapid, 53% increase in incidence. Changes in classification, registration, and coding have also affected rates for and diagnosed types of childhood brain tumors. Keep in mind that, as shown above, mortality declined across the childhood brain tumor category. 3\nSimilar findings have been made for pancreatic and kidney cancer, hematologic cancers, and more. In short, there is considerable risk of overdiagnosis, even among the young. There is also evidence for improved diagnosis that saves lives but increases apparent incidence, and there is also a staggeringly increasing burden derived from obesity and other chronic diseases wrapped up with obesity. However, despite the growing burden of obesity-related cancers, they have not resulted in the trend towards declining death rates across all early-onset cancers being reversed.\nColorectal Cancer: We Have A Preventative. Why Aren’t We Using It?\nEarly-onset colorectal cancer is exceptional. Its incidence has been steadily rising since 1998 in both sexes among those aged 20-49. At the same time, mortality rates from colorectal cancer have stagnated in the case of women and increased slightly after about 2005 in the case of men.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\niHeard STL, 2025\nThis recent increase is a cause for some alarm, but its scale should be contextualized before continuing to discuss it. In the same period where incidence increased, the change would be barely visible on a chart including older ages, for whom mortality has steadily improved.\n\nImage: The figure is a combination of line graphs showing death rates from colorectal cancer, by age group, in the United States during 1999 –2019 according to the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\n\nCDC MMWR, 2021\nEven reacting to this modest increase with unnecessary alarm, it should be acknowledged that there are reasons to be hopeful about early-onset colorectal cancer. For one, it’s consistently linked to obesity and it’s likely that this link is to some extent a causal one. Other risk factors for early-onset colorectal cancer, such as alcohol consumption and hyperlipidemia are linked to obesity as well. These links complicate figuring out what exactly the contributions of each of the known factors are to the overall rise. However, their contributions alongside other factors like metabolic syndrome, ulcerative colitis, chronic kidney disease, and so on, at least seem to be large, and thankfully, they are now virtually all indirectly or directly addressable through pharmacotherapy and surgery.\nFor example, hyperlipidemia is now able to be safely addressed with statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors. This can be done without problem from a young age. But genetic evidence suggests it will not help us in our quest to address early-onset cancers. That genetic evidence shows that cholesterol levels do not contribute to the risk of the broad category of all cancers. If this holds for colorectal cancer specifically, then that provides public health authorities with information they can use to ‘look elsewhere’ and provide advice that’s likely to help rather than waste.\nBut obesity does play a causal role in early-onset colorectal cancers and many other ones, and we have an effective treatment for obesity now. The effect sizes found in large-sample and meta-analytic studies of the relationship between GLP-1RA usage and colorectal cancer—among other simultaneously benefitted cancers—suggest that using them at scale would not only halt the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer, but reverse it to a major degree. Because this is easy and can be inexpensive to pursue if the Congress or the current White House, say, negotiate down GLP-1RA prices or buys the patent for generic manufacturers, it should be pursued as a first-line response to the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer.\nIf, after obesity is reduced as much as we can get it with pharmacotherapeutics, we find that early-onset colorectal cancer incidence rises again, it may then be time to focus on other major risk factors likely to be causally involved, like alcohol consumption. The reason to do this to a lesser degree or possibly after the a weight loss-focused main approach is that this will be far less effective and lives are on the line. Governments can simultaneously pursue multiple lines of action, but in health policy, pursuing one option tends to come at the cost of will that can be applied to pursuing other, potentially more effective ones. Moreover, the government simply has limited ability to reduce alcohol intake, and their ability to find and act on other potential causes—given that other age groups who are equally exposed to the modern environment are doing fine—will, in many cases, be even more limited.\nIn short, early-onset colorectal cancer incidence and mortality is up, but it’s not up so much that people should be stressing out about it and it does not overturn concerns about overdiagnosis and resulting overtreatment or the generally fortunate trends for other cancers. More importantly, there is a readily-available fix available to reverse this unfortunate trend.\nColorectal Cancer: Why Not An Information Campaign?\nA major contributing factor to the risk of death from early-onset colorectal cancer is underdiagnosis.\nEarly-onset colorectal cancer is underdiagnosed in the sense that, when it’s caught, it usually already become highly-developed: most young patients are only identified as having colorectal cancer in stages three or four. Moreover, young people usually report having multiple symptoms before they’re diagnosed, with a majority mentioning that after identifying that they had serious symptoms, they adopted a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude before pursuing medical care.\nTo make the situation with early-onset colorectal cancer identification worse, it’s so unusual to get it at a young age, that doctors frequently put up roadblocks for patients. Doctors prefer to focus on more likely and less severe alternative diagnoses to explain their symptoms, and large numbers of doctors will refuse to refer young patients for colonoscopies, let alone do so in a timely manner.\nThese facts provide clear support for information campaigns. With the rise in incidence, young people ought to know the signs so that when they show up, they don’t drag their feet on pursuing medical care, and they act more forcefully to push their providers to screen them. The more costly possibility is lowering the standard age at which screenings begin and advancing the use of less invasive screenings like fecal occult blood tests and sigmoidoscopies.\nWithout any effort to engage in a formal cost-benefit analysis, I suspect that informational campaigning would yield more favorable returns than greatly expanding screening. While the latter may lead to more cases identified and lives saved, it’s tremendously more expensive for a condition that is still very rare in the age groups being discussed.\n\nQuick Question and Answer\nIs there an early-onset cancer epidemic?\nWhen an epidemic is defined by a large absolute increase in early-onset cancers, the big picture answer is “no”.\nBut are more young people diagnosed with cancers than they used to be?\nIncidence trends are mostly flat or slightly increasing, with notable increases still being limited in number and scale. Broadly-speaking, diagnostic trends are driven more by changes in identification and diagnostic practice than they are by genuine increases in incidence at a given severity level, and an increase in obesity-related cancers has eclipsed any increase in non-obesity-related cancers.\nAre more young people being crippled by cancer than before?\nNo, age-specific DALYs are down, and this is true for the young as well as the old. However, due to increasing rates of overdiagnosis, more young people are being harmed by having their cancers identified.\nAre more young people being killed by cancer than before?\nNo, age-specific death rates are down, and this is true for the young as well as the old.\nWhat’s up with early-onset colorectal cancer incidence?\nColorectal cancer is almost the only major cancer to seriously buck the pleasant trend seen for most other cancers afflicting the young. The explanation for its rise is partly obesity, which we can now address cheaply and efficient, and so we should now do that. The scale of and source for the residual component of the rise is unclear, but it is notable that it has not been credibly linked to any known toxicants.\nWhat’s up with the early-onset colorectal cancer mortality trends?\nThe answer to this question ought to be largely that it is a natural outgrowth of heightened incidence. More practically, the rise has a lot to do with slow updates to potentially outdated standards of care.\nThe health system has failed to move rapidly to update towards giving colorectal cancer-related advice to the young and towards giving providers the advice to enhance screening levels for the young. As such, when colorectal cancer is detected among young people, it is generally far more severe than it should have been had people been more careful and acknowledged their symptoms when they occurred. These cancers are also more severe than they would have been compared to the world in which providers are more willing to perform colonoscopies or engage in other diagnostic and preventative procedures with young patients.\nBecause of the still absolutely low rates of colorectal cancers in the young, the debatable efficacy of available screening methods, and the high cost of said screenings, it is not clear whether expanding the standard of care to encourage screening at lower ages would pass muster in a formal cost-benefit analysis.\n1\n\nFor reference, the obesity-related cancers were esophageal, stomach, colorectal, liver, gallbladder and extrahepatic bile duct, pancreatic, corpus uterine, ovarian, kidney, thyroid, and multiple myeloma, whereas the non-obesity-related cancers were lip, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, lung, melanoma of skin, Kaposi sarcoma, breast, cervix uterine, prostate, testis, bladder, brain and central nervous system, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.\nEarly-onset breast cancer was classified as non-obesity-related despite postmenopausal breast cancer being obesity-related because the sample was defined to be young enough that menopause was uncommon, and thus the cancers would’ve been premenopausal in large part. Premenopausal breast cancer is negatively correlated with BMI.\n2\n\nThis suggests diagnosis may be causing increasingly large amounts of harm, because the prescribed treatments and biopsies are worse than the affliction in the growing share of benign-but-treated-anyway cases.\n3\n\nCuriously, the decline was more rapid in the years just before the advent of MRIs.",

that has undergone <em>land rights conversion</em>, where, when two-thirds of the area&#8217;s existing homeowners agree, everyone&#8217;s right to their land is converted to the rights to an equivalent part of a new building that will be constructed on the land, potentially alongside other amenities, infrastructure, and additional buildings.</p><p>The key consideration in that last paragraph was how the decision to modify the land was made: through direct democracy by the area&#8217;s existing homeowners. The complex bargaining between local officials, activists, and landowners looking to build under different legal arrangements in the U.S. is radically simplified by putting the decision-making power in the lands of the people most affected by the land&#8217;s development. The question changes from &#8220;<em>Will someone use the </em>liberum veto?&#8221; to &#8220;<em>Do the people wish to see their land improved?&#8221; </em>If the answer is in the affirmative, the people win.</p><p>Surprisingly, this means that Japan has relatively <em>weak </em>eminent domain law in the sense that their setup makes more concessions to existing landowners. To understand why, consider a community where the owners of different plots, enumerated A through H, need to gain access to infrastructure. They&#8217;re originally set up like so:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

Everyone maintains a plot and infrastructure gets built. People only compromise on size, proximity, to other plots, and so on. As a means of provisioning urban infrastructure, this is obviously going to be more acceptable to large numbers of people than is the use of eminent domain. But is it better than simply not building at all?</p><p>People who already own land might wish to keep it a certain way. Land readjustment might not be for them, and it&#8217;s likely to make them very upset because the people around them might vote to change their claims around.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> But enough people will agree to land readjustments in enough places that it can have radical impacts on economic geography, rewarding those who accept it with access to new infrastructure and higher densities. There will even be some people who elect to have the government or firms build infrastructure on their jointly-held parcels, letting them bid to build on their land. When the building is through, it&#8217;ll be returned to its owners in their newly-arranged plots.</p><p>Consider, for example, the readjustment of the Obu-Hantsuki area of Aichi Prefecture between 1994 and 2002:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

Similar programs have also helped to build rail lines and other local amenities. But how do programs like this get implemented? They upset incumbents, so there&#8217;s definitely resistance. </p><p>In Israel&#8217;s case, the programs were tolerated because of a need for resilience to earthquakes and concerns about dilapidation to the country&#8217;s relatively dated and hastily constructed housing stock. The country&#8217;s previously poor housing stock was made in such a slapdash manner because it was built to allow Israel to take in massive waves of immigrants and refugees. Or in other words, there was a historical impetus for the development of a quality institutional setup.</p><p>A curious fact is that this makes Israel a bit like Japan. Part of the motivation for Israel&#8217;s housing policies also applies to the Japanese case, where the issue of earthquakes has always loomed large.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Looking Even Further West</h3><p>To get good housing policies given the political economy of incumbents who generally don&#8217;t want more housing, there has to be some impetus in place and a means of making new building tolerable. Israel and Japan have figured out their own ways of making this happen, and the country of France might be yet another good institutional model.</p><p>In the French case, the law since 1977 has held that, above some size threshold, buildings must be subjected to a set of heightened quality standards. These standards are binding past an &#8220;Architect Requirement Threshold&#8221;, whereafter licensed architects become the mandated preparers for building creation or modification plans. The plan &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240606200726/https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xwypod5aqEr3GKPAnQbbpiFW6hBBC47J/view\">aims at ensuring that only aesthetically pleasing, durable, and safe new housing is built.</a>&#8221;</p><p>The thresholds are exploited. Developers try to avoid exceeding thresholds because of the added costs of contracting a licensed architect and meeting their exacting demands. This is highly visible in the distributions of floor areas in new units:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg\" width=\"1125\" height=\"757\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:757,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac84a03a-9d5e-4484-94e0-f7f963325a8c_1125x757.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Levy 2024, Figure 3D</figcaption></figure></div><p>My point is less that France has issues with compliance with these sorts of regulations, more that it has thought of them, and that they seem like a fine concession. Imagine: What if homes could be built so long as they had a little added cost in the form of aesthetic review?</p><p>A major complaint at many zoning board meetings is that new homes being proposed are ugly. To that, France has generated a simple solution: mandate pleasing aesthetics and move on. Take locals&#8217; views out of consideration and place the control in the hands of architects and bureaucrats whose duties are minimal&#8212;but necessary to satisfy the community&#8212;and whose demands cannot be extreme. The demands just have to be real, whereas in the current zoning board-dominated regime, they are frequently not. By that I mean, aesthetics are usually an <em>excuse</em> to reject building, which leads me to the French answer: accept the excuse, but take away the bargaining power it creates!<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a></p><p>Another westerly F-place worth mentioning here is Florida. In 2021, they passed a permitting reform bill for housing that made the state&#8217;s housing regime far more by-right than it was before. Under the bill, local jurisdictions are required to provide details about their permitting processes and the status of permit applications. This alone takes out a large portion of the issue with building by removing the opacity of the housing regime, but that&#8217;s not all.</p><p>Florida&#8217;s permitting reform bill also requires that permits are responded to in a timely manner. If a local jurisdiction does not respond within thirty business days, each additional day the permit is unanswered is a 10% refund of its total cost. If a permit is rejected, that&#8217;s not the end of it. Now, the jurisdiction must provide actionable feedback that can lead to correction and eventual approval. After this came into effect, Florida experienced an overnight building boom, and all because saying &#8220;Yes, and&#8230;&#8221; became the default.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Yes, and&#8230;</h3><p>The techniques for building that I&#8217;ve outlined here all have one thing in common: they&#8217;re about getting people to say <em>yes </em>to building <em>something</em>. They&#8217;re things that <em>enough </em>people will find agreeable to allow <em>something </em>to be built. The overarching idea is simple: reformulate land use to take away the ability to say &#8220;no&#8221; or to otherwise stop building in its tracks. Instead, provide people with the ability to say &#8220;yes&#8221; with limited provisos that will help to leave them happier than if they had no input at all.</p><p>For the sake of clarity, limiting discretion is key, or even a place that adopts land readjustment will wind up held back by NIMBYs once again. The &#8220;and&#8230;&#8221; that comes when builders are told &#8220;yes&#8221; has to be sufficiently clear, final, and limited in scope, or it&#8217;s not really an &#8220;and&#8230;&#8221; at all&#8212;it&#8217;s a &#8220;no&#8221;.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Agglomeration Imperative</h3><p>Something must be done to <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/joes.12543\">promote agglomeration</a>. By that I mean to promote not just urbanization, but different ways of allowing more people to get together in the real world. That includes not only high-density homebuilding in prime locations, but also the creation of rapid transport into those areas from far afield. Rail lines are a standout way to accomplish that goal, as they allow people to have their homes far outside of cities, but to easily <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18344-5\">enter cities</a> rapidly, reliably, with little congestion and environmental impact, and at low cost.</p><p>Adopting mass rail transport generates a variety of benefits. As I&#8217;ve already suggested, it alleviates the demand for housing within cities. For two, it concentrates economic activity within certain areas of cities by placing it near stations, putting minds closer together while also making it possible to easily concentrate governmental resources like police<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-11\" href=\"#footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a> in places where you can guarantee more traffic is happening. For three, it promotes geographic and social mobility due to its low user cost and time requirements.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-12\" href=\"#footnote-12\" target=\"_self\">12</a></p><p>There are many other benefits to rail, but it&#8217;s also not the only thing that can be used to promote agglomeration. With the imperative and the means to have more homes and infrastructure provided by treating building as a matter of &#8220;Yes, and&#8230;&#8221; with land readjustment, democratically-supported upzoning, and aesthetic requirements, cities could demand and receive more green space, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-020-09490-6\">improved street lighting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150299\">designated zones where licentious activities happen</a> (because if they&#8217;ll happen anyway, might as well have them happen around a bunch of police), and the room to work on other neglected aspects of city infrastructure, from fiber optic cabling on down to updates to sewage systems, accessibility, and more.</p><p>The benefits to agglomeration are <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1871272178156699667\">small percentage growth dividends,</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/rich-country-poor-country\">in the medium-to-long term, that means enormous returns</a>. The price of delivering those returns could be as low as giving people democratic control of their cities.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-13\" href=\"#footnote-13\" target=\"_self\">13</a></p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Cf. <a href=\"https://archive.md/601Vu\">this</a>. The problem with this response to Burn-Murdoch&#8217;s display that the Anglosphere has anemic homebuilding is that it seems to neglect that the Anglosphere clearly isn&#8217;t building <em>enough</em>, even if it&#8217;s building <em>a lot </em>in absolute terms, as evidenced by its extreme increase in housing costs.

The legal regimes in these countries give existing home and land owners enormous power over what gets built near them, making it difficult to densify and connect cities. In their current incarnations, those systems are reminiscent of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but their problems could be fixed if they transitioned to direct democracy.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBurn-Murdoch 2023\nIn the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the legislature ( Sejm) had a rule that allowed for any member to immediately end the current legislative session. The liberum veto 2 made it impossible to convene a legislative session, for reasons domestic and foreign. Namely, foreign powers were able to exploit the legislative deadlock by paying off lords to use the veto, so the Commonwealth could not react to problems. From the beginning, the extremely individualistic and egalitarian setup of the Sejm meant the Commonwealth was doomed.\n\nImage: undefined\n\n\n\nPicture of Europe for July 1772\nAnglo-Saxon land use regimes provide individuals with something akin to the liberum veto, creating some of the world’s most effective N ot I n M y B ack Y ard- ism. Private citizens can vote down permitting local projects and they can leverage state and local laws to stall projects indefinitely, or at least until the point where they fall apart since long waits doom builders. Local elected officials have many means to frustrate building and they’re easily captured by local concerns, interest groups, and various parochial interests. 3\nFor a solution, look east—specifically, to Japan.\n\nHow Does Japan Build Cities?\n\nImage: An aerial photo of Tokyo, the most populous city on Earth : r/pics\n\n\n\n\nTokyo is an urban wonder, but it would be much less wonderful without land readjustment. Roughly one-third of all of Japan’s urban building was done through a process of replotting land parcels and reconstructing homes to increase local density and make way for new infrastructure. 4 Conceptually, that looks like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nMatsui 2019, Figure 1.1\nIn this diagram, you can see an area of low-density homes that has undergone land rights conversion, where, when two-thirds of the area’s existing homeowners agree, everyone’s right to their land is converted to the rights to an equivalent part of a new building that will be constructed on the land, potentially alongside other amenities, infrastructure, and additional buildings.\nThe key consideration in that last paragraph was how the decision to modify the land was made: through direct democracy by the area’s existing homeowners. The complex bargaining between local officials, activists, and landowners looking to build under different legal arrangements in the U.S. is radically simplified by putting the decision-making power in the lands of the people most affected by the land’s development. The question changes from “ Will someone use the liberum veto?” to “ Do the people wish to see their land improved?” If the answer is in the affirmative, the people win.\nSurprisingly, this means that Japan has relatively weak eminent domain law in the sense that their setup makes more concessions to existing landowners. To understand why, consider a community where the owners of different plots, enumerated A through H, need to gain access to infrastructure. They’re originally set up like so:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nDe Souza 2018, Figure 1.1A\nIn America’s eminent domain regime, one way to connect these plots to infrastructure is like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nDe Souza 2018, Figure 1.1C\nThe owners of plots A and G had their land expropriated to make way for the road, sidewalks, and other utilities. The owners of B, D, and E, and to some extent F, were compensated for the loss of parts of their claims through eminent domain, and they benefit through asset appreciation resulting from the new infrastructure. The owners of C and H got to fully maintain their properties, while also benefitting from proximity to new builds.\nThe system of expropriations and remodeling is not terribly fair, and it operates against the will of many of the people, to the benefit of a lucky few. Now let’s look at how Japan does it:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nDe Souza 2018, Figure 1.1D\nWith land readjustment, no one is expropriated. Everyone maintains a plot and infrastructure gets built. People only compromise on size, proximity, to other plots, and so on. As a means of provisioning urban infrastructure, this is obviously going to be more acceptable to large numbers of people than is the use of eminent domain. But is it better than simply not building at all?\nPeople who already own land might wish to keep it a certain way. Land readjustment might not be for them, and it’s likely to make them very upset because the people around them might vote to change their claims around. 5 But enough people will agree to land readjustments in enough places that it can have radical impacts on economic geography, rewarding those who accept it with access to new infrastructure and higher densities. There will even be some people who elect to have the government or firms build infrastructure on their jointly-held parcels, letting them bid to build on their land. When the building is through, it’ll be returned to its owners in their newly-arranged plots.\nConsider, for example, the readjustment of the Obu-Hantsuki area of Aichi Prefecture between 1994 and 2002:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOr consider the development of this new town in Chiba Prefecture between 1989 and 2005:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOr, if you’re a real nerd, just consider this picture of the Tsukuba Express. Why? Because land readjustment was crucial for building it!\n\nImage: About TX | Useful information | TSUKUBA EXPRESS\n\n\n\n\nHigh-speed rail? It can be had with land readjustment. 6 A sparkling new tower full of homes? Land readjustment. A new park, airport, school, stadium, subway, bus line, trolley, convention center, bike lane, or hotel? Land readjustment can bring these things to fruition by transforming complicated representative democracy questions into simple, one-off direct democracy ones. 7\nTo continue reading about land readjustment, here are several links. 8\n\nLooking Back West\nJapan is not the only country that uses land readjustment successfully. India, for example, has had several notable successes with it. Go just a bit further west from there and you’ll arrive in Israel, where similar democratic schemes have broken zoning deadlock and promoted urbanization.\nMore than a third of Israel’s new construction is done through two programs:\n\nPinui Binui: A program within which buildings are rezoned for rebuilding, with the choice to go through the process started through an agreement between homeowners and developers.\n\nTAMA 38: A program where homeowners only need to make a deal with developers to update existing buildings built before 1980, or to demolish and build something else in place.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nAn illustration of using Pinui Binui to demolish and rebuild bigger, via Alster 2024\nThese programs are elective, hyper-local, and successful, demonstrating dispositively that elective upzoning is politically feasible in Western nations. Similar programs have also helped to build rail lines and other local amenities. But how do programs like this get implemented? They upset incumbents, so there’s definitely resistance.\nIn Israel’s case, the programs were tolerated because of a need for resilience to earthquakes and concerns about dilapidation to the country’s relatively dated and hastily constructed housing stock. The country’s previously poor housing stock was made in such a slapdash manner because it was built to allow Israel to take in massive waves of immigrants and refugees. Or in other words, there was a historical impetus for the development of a quality institutional setup.\nA curious fact is that this makes Israel a bit like Japan. Part of the motivation for Israel’s housing policies also applies to the Japanese case, where the issue of earthquakes has always loomed large. 9\n\nLooking Even Further West\nTo get good housing policies given the political economy of incumbents who generally don’t want more housing, there has to be some impetus in place and a means of making new building tolerable. Israel and Japan have figured out their own ways of making this happen, and the country of France might be yet another good institutional model.\nIn the French case, the law since 1977 has held that, above some size threshold, buildings must be subjected to a set of heightened quality standards. These standards are binding past an “Architect Requirement Threshold”, whereafter licensed architects become the mandated preparers for building creation or modification plans. The plan “ aims at ensuring that only aesthetically pleasing, durable, and safe new housing is built. ”\nThe thresholds are exploited. Developers try to avoid exceeding thresholds because of the added costs of contracting a licensed architect and meeting their exacting demands. This is highly visible in the distributions of floor areas in new units:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nLevy 2024, Figure 3D\nMy point is less that France has issues with compliance with these sorts of regulations, more that it has thought of them, and that they seem like a fine concession. Imagine: What if homes could be built so long as they had a little added cost in the form of aesthetic review?\nA major complaint at many zoning board meetings is that new homes being proposed are ugly. To that, France has generated a simple solution: mandate pleasing aesthetics and move on. Take locals’ views out of consideration and place the control in the hands of architects and bureaucrats whose duties are minimal—but necessary to satisfy the community—and whose demands cannot be extreme. The demands just have to be real, whereas in the current zoning board-dominated regime, they are frequently not. By that I mean, aesthetics are usually an excuse to reject building, which leads me to the French answer: accept the excuse, but take away the bargaining power it creates! 10\nAnother westerly F-place worth mentioning here is Florida. In 2021, they passed a permitting reform bill for housing that made the state’s housing regime far more by-right than it was before. Under the bill, local jurisdictions are required to provide details about their permitting processes and the status of permit applications. This alone takes out a large portion of the issue with building by removing the opacity of the housing regime, but that’s not all.\nFlorida’s permitting reform bill also requires that permits are responded to in a timely manner. If a local jurisdiction does not respond within thirty business days, each additional day the permit is unanswered is a 10% refund of its total cost. If a permit is rejected, that’s not the end of it. Now, the jurisdiction must provide actionable feedback that can lead to correction and eventual approval. After this came into effect, Florida experienced an overnight building boom, and all because saying “Yes, and…” became the default.\n\nYes, and…\nThe techniques for building that I’ve outlined here all have one thing in common: they’re about getting people to say yes to building something. They’re things that enough people will find agreeable to allow something to be built. The overarching idea is simple: reformulate land use to take away the ability to say “no” or to otherwise stop building in its tracks. Instead, provide people with the ability to say “yes” with limited provisos that will help to leave them happier than if they had no input at all.\nFor the sake of clarity, limiting discretion is key, or even a place that adopts land readjustment will wind up held back by NIMBYs once again. The “and…” that comes when builders are told “yes” has to be sufficiently clear, final, and limited in scope, or it’s not really an “and…” at all—it’s a “no”.\n\nThe Agglomeration Imperative\nSomething must be done to promote agglomeration. By that I mean to promote not just urbanization, but different ways of allowing more people to get together in the real world. That includes not only high-density homebuilding in prime locations, but also the creation of rapid transport into those areas from far afield. Rail lines are a standout way to accomplish that goal, as they allow people to have their homes far outside of cities, but to easily enter cities rapidly, reliably, with little congestion and environmental impact, and at low cost.\nAdopting mass rail transport generates a variety of benefits. As I’ve already suggested, it alleviates the demand for housing within cities. For two, it concentrates economic activity within certain areas of cities by placing it near stations, putting minds closer together while also making it possible to easily concentrate governmental resources like police 11 in places where you can guarantee more traffic is happening. For three, it promotes geographic and social mobility due to its low user cost and time requirements. 12\nThere are many other benefits to rail, but it’s also not the only thing that can be used to promote agglomeration. With the imperative and the means to have more homes and infrastructure provided by treating building as a matter of “Yes, and…” with land readjustment, democratically-supported upzoning, and aesthetic requirements, cities could demand and receive more green space, improved street lighting, designated zones where licentious activities happen(because if they’ll happen anyway, might as well have them happen around a bunch of police), and the room to work on other neglected aspects of city infrastructure, from fiber optic cabling on down to updates to sewage systems, accessibility, and more.\nThe benefits to agglomeration are small percentage growth dividends, and in the medium-to-long term, that means enormous returns. The price of delivering those returns could be as low as giving people democratic control of their cities. 13\n1\n\nCf. this. The problem with this response to Burn-Murdoch’s display that the Anglosphere has anemic homebuilding is that it seems to neglect that the Anglosphere clearly isn’t building enough, even if it’s building a lot in absolute terms, as evidenced by its extreme increase in housing costs. Consider the data provided by over at, in this article.\nFirstly, the Anglosphere has had markedly increased prices:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, the Anglosphere has built unimpressively for how much population growth it’s experienced:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, this dovetails with the building patterns of the Anglosphere being uniquely inimical to high-density urban building as Burn-Murdoch described. Burn-Murdoch showed that British and American attitudes towards building are not pro-density in the sense of supporting apartments/flats:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nAnd the countries themselves are not high-density in terms of having high proportions of apartments/flats, or even just being very literally high-density:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nThese facts together suggest that the Anglosphere really is deficient at home-building in an important way that countries outside the Anglosphere generally are not.\n2\n\nAmong homebuilding advocates, what I’m analogizing to the liberum veto is more often called a “heckler’s veto”, but I prefer the historical analogy.\n3\n\nLaws like NEPA can also make it impossible to build the infrastructure required for densification. As an example, consider the struggle to build bike lanes in San Francisco. The failure to build even simple infrastructure like that contributes to the veto power of local interest groups and activists because it can be cited as a justification to delay or revoke building projects.\n4\n\nIt’s likely that much more than one-third of Japan’s urban development can be attributed to land readjustment after accounting for its indirect impacts on urban land allocation.\n5\n\nIn Japan, the government and private developers can provide incentives to encourage people to agree to readjustment, and sometimes people feel compelled to agree because their property values may decline otherwise. It can take years for people to obtain the consent of landowners to remodel their land, so this is no panacea, but it is better than t he process not existing at all.\n6\n\nA major issue preventing it is how hard it is to acquire large swathes of land, and this simplifies doing that.\n7\n\nIn theory, this system can also leave developers in a better position, since it can be fashioned in a way that lets them face all of their permitting barriers up-front.\n8\n\nAlso read these, about zoning in the U.S. and Japan.\n9\n\nMoreover, like Israel, Japan had to rapidly produce a large amount of housing in recent generations. In Japan’s case, the reason was World War II, and the policies from that era have stuck in some form or another. In Israel’s case, the issue was mass migration, and the poor policies of that era led to the better policies of today.\n10\n\nSomething similar has been proposed in the U.K. To my knowledge, they have been met with limited success.\n11\n\nCrime seems to harm agglomeration.\n12\n\nIt might even promote electric vehicle adoption, as in China.\n13\n\nAlso you have to reform NEPA (and, where applicable, its state-level equivalents) or it’s not even feasible to do major urban remodeling.",

This conclusion is in error for two reasons that have to do with magnitudes.</p><p>The first discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the fertility benefits. <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Lyman Stone&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:8919581,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c062404-95e3-4b54-96a3-875f4ff87641_4000x6000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;b93cf4d2-82ed-490e-9e58-58baecd2b1b9&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> has already <a href=\"https://archive.md/EfzSG\">produced an informative graph</a> that directly addresses the misinterpretation of this magnitude, so I&#8217;ll just share it for you all here.</p><p>Lyman&#8217;s graph shows France, with and without its pronatal child benefits. In the scenario with them, the total fertility rate is elevated by 0.1 to 0.2 points. It&#8217;s conceivable that people would view that amount as &#8220;small&#8221;, but it&#8217;s harder to maintain that view after reframing it in terms of existing French lives. Put differently, 5 to 10 million Frenchmen (~7-15% of the total 2023 French population) resulting from these policies is <em>definitely not small</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:496,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:640,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The second discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the lifetime tax revenues of children. Fertility benefit skeptics seem to believe that child benefits are very costly and children do not provide much in the way of returns to the state after they&#8217;ve become adults. This is far from true.</p><p>The lifetime tax returns of the typical American are in the hundreds of thousands, while the cost of fertility benefits is a pittance.

Fair enough, I&#8217;ll accept this point even though I place a high value on human life itself. If the point is true and worrying, simply adjust the benefits so that they&#8217;re disbursed through non-refundable tax credits, made available as direct tax reductions, provided with means-testing, provided in-kind as <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1892288200296505724\">subsidized IVF</a> (which only responsible parents <em>should </em>seek), or so on and so forth. <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/fertility-policy-for-rich-countries\">My preferred child benefit setup</a> provides massive inducements to be fertile and multiply without a preference for low-tax births.</p><div><hr></div><p>Now that we&#8217;re equipped with the cognitive tools to keep us counterfactually-minded and aware of the magnitudes that matter, let&#8217;s look at and qualify empirical estimates of the effects of fertility benefits.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Benefits = Babies</h3><p>When France introduced means testing to its child allowances, <a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/60/5/1493/382373/Fertility-and-Labor-Supply-Responses-to-Child\">fertility abruptly fell as the rate of decline in the fertility rate increased</a>.

This wasn&#8217;t a big benefit, but it was enough that repeal brought the annual birth rate decrement from -0.76 points to -1.80, then -1.84 the next year, then -1.87 after that, -1.91 in 2017, and finally, -1.94 in 2018.</p><p>Similarly impactful reforms have taken place in many locations.

Milligan&#8217;s paper leveraged the rollout of Quebec&#8217;s broad, pronatalist child benefits of up to C$8,000 to families of newborn children, finding that &#8220;the fertility of those eligible&#8230; is estimated to have increased by 12% on average, and by 25% for those eligible for the maximum benefit&#8221; as well as that an extra C$1,000 of benefits generates a 16.9% increase in fertility. Gonz&#225;lez found that Spain&#8217;s universal child benefits led to a considerable 6% increase in fertility in response to an 8.3% increase in income, driven by reduced numbers of abortions. The Cohen paper observed that reducing Israel&#8217;s child subsidies by the equivalent of 3.3% of income reduced fertility by 9.6%.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-023-09793-z\">a study of the fertility impacts of a universal child transfer in northern Norway</a>, the state covering 58% of the expenses of a child&#8217;s first year of life (12% more than normal) increased the odds of a child among those in their 20s by five percentage points. There was also an increase in the percentage of those with three kids of 1.4 percentage points.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> The effect pushed up fertility among those who were unmarried, but it didn&#8217;t seem to increase poverty.</p><p>In South Korea, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9383-z\">municipality-level childbirth grants and allowances have clear positive effects on fertility</a>. A 10 million won&#8212;or about $8,000 at the time&#8212;increase in family benefits comes with a 3.5% increase in total fertility. The authors projected that, to return Korea to a fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman (from about 1 per woman) would therefore require subsidies of about 44 million won per child. This is very large and likely unworkable, so they should do something else, but at least it&#8217;s apparent that Koreans are not immune to fertility incentives.</p><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-016-9417-x\">The Argentinian government initiated monthly roughly $50 cash transfers to households without workers in the formal sector</a>, leading to about two percentage points higher fertility among those with a child already, and no impact on the childless.

In <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">a 2021 review</a> of various pronatal policies, the section on transfers repeated much the same: &#8220;Overall, there is quite solid evidence that increases in transfers have an immediate effect on fertility&#8221; and this effect was generally sizable. Similarly, <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Lyman Stone&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:8919581,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c062404-95e3-4b54-96a3-875f4ff87641_4000x6000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;fee3ca13-37f2-4033-86c2-7fb5a36a518c&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> estimated an elasticity of fertility to a 1% increase in income of between 0.04 and 0.30.</p><p>Leveraging Lyman&#8217;s estimates, the elasticity to the private value of having a child&#8212;defined <a href=\"https://model-thinking.com/p/refillable-planet\">here</a>&#8212;would be $287,800/$80,610 (<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm\">inflation-adjusted</a> ages 0-18 cost of childrearing<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a>/household income) in 2023 = 3.57 * 0.04-0.30 = 0.14-1.07 (median = 0.47), <a href=\"https://model-thinking.com/p/refillable-planet\">thus justifying massive spending for even well-below median performing pronatal programs</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><p>But even this heartening level of efficacy should be qualified as being unduly pessimistic for a simple reason: relatively effective and ineffective policies are being lumped together to produce those elasticity estimates. Family leave policy, for instance, tends to be less efficacious for promoting fertility than transfers. Pessimists towards pronatal policy tend to gloss over or exploit ignorance about this distinction.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230503235403/https://reason.com/2023/05/02/storks-dont-take-orders-from-the-state/\">the piece whose title prompted this one&#8217;s</a>, the author wrote &#8220;The amount of money required to trigger even these small effects is enormous&#8230; &#8216;one extra percentage point of GDP spending&#8217; <strong>on early childhood education and child care programs</strong> was &#8216;associated with 0.2 extra children per woman.&#8217; In the U.S., where the 2022 GDP was $25.46 trillion, that would mean spending more than $250 billion.&#8221; Sadly, this conflation of relatively more and less efficacious programs was not addressed in that now well-cited article.</p><p>The issue of endogeneity when doing cross-country comparisons was also not dealt with at all in that article. That is to say, the author seemed to notice that different countries had different policies and that they were ending up with different fertility levels, but was much less interested in evaluating where their fertility situations would be with different sets of policies. As the bulk of the evidence in the literature indicates, however, pronatal policy definitely works. Each country implements different policies, in different ways, in different pre-existing fertility regimes, so we should expect those places to function&#8212;in a word&#8212;<em>differently</em>, preventing simple, cross-sectional pooh-poohing of the policies implemented in different countries.</p><p>Someone who is serious about whether pronatal policies work would not ignore this issue. Instead, they would cast aside simple claims like &#8216;Hungary does a lot of pronatal policy and their fertility is poor, so it must not work!&#8217; The reality, described <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/pro-natal-policies-work-but-they-come-with-a-hefty-price-tag\">here</a>, is that Hungary&#8217;s pronatal policy is gimmicky and excessively targeted, making it predictably ineffective because the policies do not correspond to anything like best practices. Hungary may appear to be &#8216;all-in&#8217; on pronatal policy and struggling, but that hardly means a thing when going &#8216;all-in&#8217; looks so different from what a competent planner would recommend. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1911555056475812232\">To get an example of what implementing empirically well-supported policy does, look no further than Mongolia. Mongolia was able to adopt simple fixes corresponding to a best practice from the literature and they saw a sizable and sustained bump in births</a>.</p><p>This is not to say that transfers are the only things that should be part of effective pronatal policy.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1681724777080279040\">Family</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-015-0562-z\">leave</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-019-01673-w\">policies</a> <em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/124/3/1363/1905162\">do</a> </em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01270-w\">still tend to work</a>,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">childcare policies </a><em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">do </a></em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">still tend to work, and healthcare policies </a><em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">do </a></em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">still tend to work</a>.

So, how could we address this? With a shock! And specifically, a shock that should predominantly have its impacts on women's socioeconomic outcomes <em>through their husbands</em>. Luckily, we have OPEC. Or more specifically, we have the coincidence of the U.S. having burdensome domestic regulations and OPEC embargoing it, causing the price of an alternative energy source&#8212;coal&#8212;to explosively increase after holding steady throughout the 1960s.</p><p>The Appalachian coal boom clearly favored the employability of males, as women weren&#8217;t going to be heading into the mines. So, as the crisis set in and coal prices spiked 44% between 1973-74 before stabilizing at twice their price throughout the 1960s, the status of men rose. But after the boom came the bust in the 1980s, as other energy sources were secured, and by 1990, the price of coal had returned to the level it was at in 1970.

Their fertility is just mediated in complex ways that lifting economic constraints might help to remedy. Focus on growth&#8212;but perhaps <em>not </em>on redistribution to women&#8212;and we may just lift them and get more babies in the process.</p><p>Others have investigated this thesis and variously found that <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/more-money-more-babies-part-3-further-evidence-on-the-positive-link-between-income-and-fertility-\">higher economic growth comes with greater fertility rates</a>; that major sources of economic disruption like <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-024-09919-x\">Brexit</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-024-09893-4\">the COVID pandemic</a> are likely to harm fertility rates; that the ebb and flow of the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09449-y\">business cycle</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-020-09556-y\">the harms of major recessions affect fertility predictably</a>; etc. And these things are sensible, because <em>raising</em> incomes leads to higher fertility.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Social Multiplication</h3><p>Everything I&#8217;ve said thus far is liable to undersell the benefits of fertility policy because people are social. For instance, in China, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1681785835396497408\">ethnic minorities exposed to exogenously lowered Han fertility reduced their own fertility</a>. If this were reversed, and fertility rates went up, the general desire for kids would probably go in the other direction, increasing instead of decreasing, by some margin.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1689761862429122560\">People raised with more kids in the family also tend to want additional children of their own</a>. Raise the average size of families, and you&#8217;ll raise expectations and resulting rates in lockstep.

If they were encapsulated in all such examples, effects would likely be even larger across the board. In short, what I&#8217;m saying is that the more we raise fertility, the more it&#8217;s liable to rise and self-sustain due to these sorts of knock-on effects. The amount of intervention required for a given boost or level target might fall with time, or it might become more effective as the willingness to have children in response to some stimulus falls. Who&#8217;s to say? We can only know if we try.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Governments Should Be Willing To Do and Pay A Lot</h3><p>I&#8217;ve briefly summarized a great deal of evidence, but I hope I&#8217;ve made it clear that the fertility rate is plastic in response to efforts to raise and lower it. If countries go all-in on credible on pronatal efforts, they can raise fertility rates by substantial margins. This evidence is so strong that, using the median elasticity above, it&#8217;s likely that the U.S. could raise its fertility rate above replacement while spending around 3% of its GDP, and it would still economically benefit substantially because the returns would exceed the costs almost three times over, and that&#8217;s not even accounting for the benefits from society becoming younger and more dynamic.</p><p>If the U.S. focused on economic growth in a more extensive, pro-family way, the required spending on fertility programs would be even lower, while<em> </em>the returns would be even higher given growth means socially raised productivity.</p><p>There is simply no need to be pessimistic about fertility policy, and yet, pessimism is the norm. I believe there&#8217;s no <em>good </em>reason for that. The reasons are variations on a theme of poor inference and poor grappling with the evidence. But with a clear mind and given all the evidence, the conclusion is clear: If we try, we can easily succeed.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\"

      "script_text": "Many people are very critical of the government’s ability to pay people to have children. The skeptical position is so common that, when fertility benefits are mentioned, one invariably earns a retort along the lines of ‘They’ve been tried and they don’t do anything.’\nBut that is not true. I believe there are at least two key errors supporting the belief.\n\nFertility Benefit Skeptics Make Causal Inference Missteps\nOne form of mistake is to consider the wrong estimates of fertility benefit effectiveness. Consider the simulated country with the following data:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe divergent series represent different outcomes for the country if it does or does not implement fertility benefits in year zero. The fertility benefit skeptic sees the series where benefits were implemented and declares “A-ha! They’ve failed!” because the series continued to decline after the benefits were implemented.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nBut the scenario without benefits has substantially lower fertility than the scenario with them. 1\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe plain fact is that both series trended down, but one was worse than the other for fertility, and it was the scenario without benefits. The superiority of scenarios with benefits to those without is something you may only be able to see clearly if you’re looking at causally-informative results. Understandably, if you are looking only at cross-sectional data, it can be easy to discount the effectiveness of benefits, because you’ll only see one or the other series, and it’s true that both went down.\nThis is something fertility benefit skeptics frequently do: they ignore worse counterfactual outcomes to fertility benefits being implemented.\n\nFertility Benefit Skeptics Don’t Consider Magnitudes\nSometimes fertility benefit skeptics do cite parts of the empirical literature, and if they’re not being selective with their citations, they’ll likely still manage to claim that fertility benefits do not work because the effects are ‘small’, and therefore ‘not worth the cost’. This conclusion is in error for two reasons that have to do with magnitudes.\nThe first discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the fertility benefits. has already produced an informative graph that directly addresses the misinterpretation of this magnitude, so I’ll just share it for you all here.\nLyman’s graph shows France, with and without its pronatal child benefits. In the scenario with them, the total fertility rate is elevated by 0.1 to 0.2 points. It’s conceivable that people would view that amount as “small”, but it’s harder to maintain that view after reframing it in terms of existing French lives. Put differently, 5 to 10 million Frenchmen (~7-15% of the total 2023 French population) resulting from these policies is definitely not small.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe second discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the lifetime tax revenues of children. Fertility benefit skeptics seem to believe that child benefits are very costly and children do not provide much in the way of returns to the state after they’ve become adults. This is far from true.\nThe lifetime tax returns of the typical American are in the hundreds of thousands, while the cost of fertility benefits is a pittance. If someone directly returns $200,000 2 to the state while only costing, say, $2,500 per year of childhood (i.e., $45,000), then their existence passes a cost-benefit test with flying colors. Throw in the indirect fiscal benefits of these policy-derived children, and benefits undoubtedly pass muster.\nOne might argue that the wrong sorts of people—those with low total lifetime tax contributions—would reproduce the most in response to fertility benefits. Fair enough, I’ll accept this point even though I place a high value on human life itself. If the point is true and worrying, simply adjust the benefits so that they’re disbursed through non-refundable tax credits, made available as direct tax reductions, provided with means-testing, provided in-kind as subsidized IVF(which only responsible parents should seek), or so on and so forth. My preferred child benefit setup provides massive inducements to be fertile and multiply without a preference for low-tax births.\n\nNow that we’re equipped with the cognitive tools to keep us counterfactually-minded and aware of the magnitudes that matter, let’s look at and qualify empirical estimates of the effects of fertility benefits.\n\nBenefits = Babies\nWhen France introduced means testing to its child allowances, fertility abruptly fell as the rate of decline in the fertility rate increased. This change is unambiguous, and all it took was reducing access to a combination birth or adoption premium, basic allowances, and allowances to support personal and professional life reconciliation.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of this decrease was to change the program from providing unconditional access to the basic allowances (about 180 Euros a month) to only being available in full to the poorest households, with half of the benefit amount being provided to middle-income households and none for the wealthiest French. This wasn’t a big benefit, but it was enough that repeal brought the annual birth rate decrement from -0.76 points to -1.80, then -1.84 the next year, then -1.87 after that, -1.91 in 2017, and finally, -1.94 in 2018.\nSimilarly impactful reforms have taken place in many locations. For example, in Germany, the government cut child-related welfare benefits to the tune of 18% of welfare recipients’ household incomes in the first year after a baby’s birth. 3 The aggregate fertility reduction resulting from this policy was a staggering 6.8% that was immediately felt between the two red lines in this graph, starting in January (first month the reform announcement could affect the birth rate due to abortions) and ending in April (the first month the reform could affect the birth rate through contraceptive use and abstinence).\n\nImage: figure 4\n\n\n\nSandner and Wiynck 2023, Fig. 4\nThe wonderful thing about this German study is that it estimated an elasticity for fertility, and it provided a brief literature review covering some other elasticity estimates. Their estimate was 0.38, which was considerable, but much smaller than the 1.3 ( Brewer, Ratcliffe and dSmith, 2012), 3.9 ( Milligan, 2005), 0.7 ( González, 2013), and 2.9 ( Cohen, Dehejia and Romanov, 2013) that they cited.\nThe Brewer paper exploited the U.K.’s 1999 low-income-targeted reforms that increased per-child spending by 50% with a difference-in-differences approach to show that births rose by about 15% among coupled—not single—women. Milligan’s paper leveraged the rollout of Quebec’s broad, pronatalist child benefits of up to C$8,000 to families of newborn children, finding that “the fertility of those eligible… is estimated to have increased by 12% on average, and by 25% for those eligible for the maximum benefit” as well as that an extra C$1,000 of benefits generates a 16.9% increase in fertility. González found that Spain’s universal child benefits led to a considerable 6% increase in fertility in response to an 8.3% increase in income, driven by reduced numbers of abortions. The Cohen paper observed that reducing Israel’s child subsidies by the equivalent of 3.3% of income reduced fertility by 9.6%.\nIn a study of the fertility impacts of a universal child transfer in northern Norway, the state covering 58% of the expenses of a child’s first year of life (12% more than normal) increased the odds of a child among those in their 20s by five percentage points. There was also an increase in the percentage of those with three kids of 1.4 percentage points. 4 The effect pushed up fertility among those who were unmarried, but it didn’t seem to increase poverty.\nIn South Korea, municipality-level childbirth grants and allowances have clear positive effects on fertility. A 10 million won—or about $8,000 at the time—increase in family benefits comes with a 3.5% increase in total fertility. The authors projected that, to return Korea to a fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman (from about 1 per woman) would therefore require subsidies of about 44 million won per child. This is very large and likely unworkable, so they should do something else, but at least it’s apparent that Koreans are not immune to fertility incentives.\nThe Argentinian government initiated monthly roughly $50 cash transfers to households without workers in the formal sector, leading to about two percentage points higher fertility among those with a child already, and no impact on the childless. Comparing mothers who were eligible to those who were ineligible, the result of the program looks fairly dramatic:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nGarganta et al. 2017, Fig. 2\nThe implementation of Quebec’s Parental Insurance Plan gave the province a more generous version of the Canadian federal Employment Insurance program and led to a considerable bump in fertility. For those without secondary education, fertility increased by 17%; for those who completed it, the jump was 46%; for those with university diplomas, there was a 27% increase in fertility. The effects are quite dramatic and shifted Quebec’s fertility above Ontario’s:\n\nImage: figure 2\n\n\n\nAge-specific fertility rates for Quebec and Ontario before and after the Parental Insurance Plan went into effect. Laplante 2024, Fig. 2\nAcross different countries and contexts, we see consistent evidence that transfers generate increases in fertility that are sizable in magnitude. In a 2021 review of various pronatal policies, the section on transfers repeated much the same: “Overall, there is quite solid evidence that increases in transfers have an immediate effect on fertility” and this effect was generally sizable. Similarly, estimated an elasticity of fertility to a 1% increase in income of between 0.04 and 0.30.\nLeveraging Lyman’s estimates, the elasticity to the private value of having a child—defined here —would be $287,800/$80,610 ( inflation-adjusted ages 0-18 cost of childrearing 5/household income) in 2023 = 3.57 * 0.04-0.30 = 0.14-1.07 (median = 0.47), thus justifying massive spending for even well-below median performing pronatal programs. 6\nBut even this heartening level of efficacy should be qualified as being unduly pessimistic for a simple reason: relatively effective and ineffective policies are being lumped together to produce those elasticity estimates. Family leave policy, for instance, tends to be less efficacious for promoting fertility than transfers. Pessimists towards pronatal policy tend to gloss over or exploit ignorance about this distinction.\nIn the piece whose title prompted this one’s, the author wrote “The amount of money required to trigger even these small effects is enormous… ‘one extra percentage point of GDP spending’ on early childhood education and child care programs was ‘associated with 0.2 extra children per woman.’ In the U.S., where the 2022 GDP was $25.46 trillion, that would mean spending more than $250 billion.” Sadly, this conflation of relatively more and less efficacious programs was not addressed in that now well-cited article.\nThe issue of endogeneity when doing cross-country comparisons was also not dealt with at all in that article. That is to say, the author seemed to notice that different countries had different policies and that they were ending up with different fertility levels, but was much less interested in evaluating where their fertility situations would be with different sets of policies. As the bulk of the evidence in the literature indicates, however, pronatal policy definitely works. Each country implements different policies, in different ways, in different pre-existing fertility regimes, so we should expect those places to function—in a word— differently, preventing simple, cross-sectional pooh-poohing of the policies implemented in different countries.\nSomeone who is serious about whether pronatal policies work would not ignore this issue. Instead, they would cast aside simple claims like ‘Hungary does a lot of pronatal policy and their fertility is poor, so it must not work!’ The reality, described here, is that Hungary’s pronatal policy is gimmicky and excessively targeted, making it predictably ineffective because the policies do not correspond to anything like best practices. Hungary may appear to be ‘all-in’ on pronatal policy and struggling, but that hardly means a thing when going ‘all-in’ looks so different from what a competent planner would recommend. To get an example of what implementing empirically well-supported policy does, look no further than Mongolia. Mongolia was able to adopt simple fixes corresponding to a best practice from the literature and they saw a sizable and sustained bump in births.\nThis is not to say that transfers are the only things that should be part of effective pronatal policy. 7 Family leave policies do still tend to work, 8 childcare policies do still tend to work, and healthcare policies do still tend to work. The efficacy may be more limited for these measures, but it’s unlikely that anywhere currently struggling with sub-replacement fertility will get their fertility rates up to acceptable levels without engaging in many measures like these, in addition to becoming more pro-housing 9 and pro-growth, because growth, as it turns out, matters.\n\nBooms = Babies\nI have seen way too many people conclude that this graph shows that income barely matters for fertility.\n\nImage: Total U.S. Fertility Rate by Family Income : r/Natalism\n\n\n\nSee also the similar graph from this piece.\nBut… why? If we increased the incomes of anyone along these ranks, their fertility might increase. Just as endogeneity plagues international comparisons, so too does it act as a bugbear for comparisons like these. But, as a simple test, when men win the lottery their fertility tends to increase. In that case, men was italicized with reason: lottery wins had no effect on fertility for women, seemingly because they had greater rates of divorce after they won. Contrarily, men had significantly lower rates of divorce and higher rates of marriage, presumably mediating their increased fertility. 10\nThis finding holds up in natural experimental settings. 11\nAs we know, women tend to want more kids than they have, and indeed in many places with sub-replacement fertility, they want more than enough to beat the replacement level. 12 So, are women lying? Consider the paper’s first result: comparing similarly-educated women living in similarly-expensive locations, completed fertility was positively correlated with husband’s income:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBlack et al. 2013, Figure 1\nThis finding might be down to selection into marriages. So, how could we address this? With a shock! And specifically, a shock that should predominantly have its impacts on women's socioeconomic outcomes through their husbands. Luckily, we have OPEC. Or more specifically, we have the coincidence of the U.S. having burdensome domestic regulations and OPEC embargoing it, causing the price of an alternative energy source—coal—to explosively increase after holding steady throughout the 1960s.\nThe Appalachian coal boom clearly favored the employability of males, as women weren’t going to be heading into the mines. So, as the crisis set in and coal prices spiked 44% between 1973-74 before stabilizing at twice their price throughout the 1960s, the status of men rose. But after the boom came the bust in the 1980s, as other energy sources were secured, and by 1990, the price of coal had returned to the level it was at in 1970. The boom, the peak, and the bust had clear effects on worker earnings and employment:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nRelieving the economic constraints felt by these workers turns out to have been very good for fertility. Adding them back turns out to have been very bad for it. Those males who experienced the boom had greater fertility, and those who experienced the bust had much worse fertility:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBlack et al. 2013, Figure 8\nThis finding speaks to the fact that women are not lying when they say they want more kids than they have right now. Their fertility is just mediated in complex ways that lifting economic constraints might help to remedy. Focus on growth—but perhaps not on redistribution to women—and we may just lift them and get more babies in the process.\nOthers have investigated this thesis and variously found that higher economic growth comes with greater fertility rates; that major sources of economic disruption like Brexit and the COVID pandemic are likely to harm fertility rates; that the ebb and flow of the business cycle and the harms of major recessions affect fertility predictably; etc. And these things are sensible, because raising incomes leads to higher fertility.\n\nSocial Multiplication\nEverything I’ve said thus far is liable to undersell the benefits of fertility policy because people are social. For instance, in China, ethnic minorities exposed to exogenously lowered Han fertility reduced their own fertility. If this were reversed, and fertility rates went up, the general desire for kids would probably go in the other direction, increasing instead of decreasing, by some margin.\nPeople raised with more kids in the family also tend to want additional children of their own. Raise the average size of families, and you’ll raise expectations and resulting rates in lockstep. Even signing people up to take care of infant simulators seems to increase pregnancy rates: 13\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nThese effects are only sometimes contained in estimates of the benefits of different pieces of pronatal policy. If they were encapsulated in all such examples, effects would likely be even larger across the board. In short, what I’m saying is that the more we raise fertility, the more it’s liable to rise and self-sustain due to these sorts of knock-on effects. The amount of intervention required for a given boost or level target might fall with time, or it might become more effective as the willingness to have children in response to some stimulus falls. Who’s to say? We can only know if we try.\n\nGovernments Should Be Willing To Do and Pay A Lot\nI’ve briefly summarized a great deal of evidence, but I hope I’ve made it clear that the fertility rate is plastic in response to efforts to raise and lower it. If countries go all-in on credible on pronatal efforts, they can raise fertility rates by substantial margins. This evidence is so strong that, using the median elasticity above, it’s likely that the U.S. could raise its fertility rate above replacement while spending around 3% of its GDP, and it would still economically benefit substantially because the returns would exceed the costs almost three times over, and that’s not even accounting for the benefits from society becoming younger and more dynamic.\nIf the U.S. focused on economic growth in a more extensive, pro-family way, the required spending on fertility programs would be even lower, while the returns would be even higher given growth means socially raised productivity.\nThere is simply no need to be pessimistic about fertility policy, and yet, pessimism is the norm. I believe there’s no good reason for that. The reasons are variations on a theme of poor inference and poor grappling with the evidence. But with a clear mind and given all the evidence, the conclusion is clear: If we try, we can easily succeed. 14\n1\n\nIf you would like a plot with all labels, here’s that:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nThe real number is above $500,000, which can easily cover things like the cost of schooling and public services consumed as children.\n3\n\nSandner and Wiynck, the authors of the German study, concluded by noting that the fertility response “found among welfare recipients… seems to be weaker than that of general populations.” Similarly, Reader, Portes and Patrick found that the U.K.’s limitation of means-tested child benefits to the first two children in a family led to perhaps a meager 0.7% lower fertility rate, or a 10% decline in relative terms, with perhaps a 16% reduction in the odds of having a third child. Why the small effect? Perhaps because there was poor awareness of the policy.\nA related fact may be that fertility policy will tend to be less effective for the very poor in general, as their kids are more often unintended. Healthcare policy, as it turns out, may help to remedy this by increasing the number of intentional births and reducing the numbers of unintentional ones.\nThere is very little reason to believe that fertility policy will be ‘dysgenic’ as it were.\n4\n\nSee this note on birth order effects.\n5\n\nSee here for additional notes.\n6\n\nNotably, if the benefit is IVF— the costs of which are relatively modest —, then we probably overestimate costs and underestimate benefits right now due to age-related changes in the success of IVF. Specifically, IVF works better for younger couples, meaning that if IVF is subsidized when it’s relatively more expensive in people’s lives, we should see greater success rates and lower spending on it and attendant procedures. If financial support is provided shortly after infertility diagnoses, the costs could be shrunken relative to the benefits even more greatly with a public subsidy for assisted reproductive technologies. Ben Podgursky is the one who pointed this out to me.\n7\n\nIt is worth noting, but not very relevant here, that the evidence that transfers work in already high-fertility environments is generally negative. Although they may still be effective at relatively high, but still much lower, levels of fertility.\n8\n\nrecently compiled some studies on this topic, but came away with different conclusions. I believe this is due to a different reading. See also, this.\n9\n\nAlthough see this on the effects of housing wealth on fertility in China.\n10\n\nThis replicated a finding from the U.S.\n11\n\nI previously wrote about this here.\n12\n\nNotably, ‘ideal fertility’ numbers are plastic and change in response to income changes, numbers of children people have already, numbers of children people are exposed to in the community and family, etc.\n13\n\nHonorable mention: The old Kibbutzim arrangement where children were communally reared seemed beneficial for fertility.\n14\n\nAnd because immigration is not a sustainable way to growth the population given falling global fertility, it must be pursued.",

To determine <em><strong>why</strong></em> autism rates<em> </em>have increased, we first have to know <em><strong>if</strong></em> autism rates have increased. There&#8217;s some evidence that speaks to that. For example, diagnosed rates of autism have clearly increased over time across every major data collection effort. If we look at <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3670-2\">recent snapshot data from one such effort conducted by the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS)</a>, we can see that autism diagnoses have stunningly increased since the 1930s, from applying to 0.001% of those in 1931 to 1.2% of five-year-olds in 2021.</p><div

striking and shocking nature of the data on this graph, interpreting it as evidence that <em>autism </em>has increased over time is hard.</p><p>For starters, the ages in the most recent cohorts are young&#8212;they&#8217;re children&#8212;but in the oldest cohorts, we&#8217;re talking about adults whose data wasn&#8217;t gathered by the CDDS when they were kids, but instead much later, long after these people had made it to adulthood, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0138-4\">when diagnosis is frequently neglected</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250227224029/https://blueabatherapy.com/autism/autism-life-expectancy/\">Autism is also associated with shorter lifespans</a>, which are even shorter for the people with the most severe manifestations of the condition. Accordingly, many of the oldest autistics would have already died off by the time the CDDS got around to surveying. These biases deflate the rate of autism the further back you go, exaggerating the subsequent increase.</p><p>The other, more pressing issue is that the constellation of traits categorized as &#8220;autism&#8221; wasn&#8217;t named until Leo Kanner&#8217;s descriptions of &#8220;abnormal behaviour&#8221; in the 1940s, and it would be another nearly <em>forty years </em>before American psychiatry provided criteria for autism diagnoses in the <em>third</em> edition of the <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(<em>DSM-III</em>).<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> Before the <em>DSM-III</em> came out in 1980, autism diagnoses were usually <em>ad hoc</em>, based on the personal views of different clinicians and researchers about what autism is and how to diagnose it. Because autism was regarded as particularly severe prior to the <em>DSM</em> treatment of it and those whose condition goes unnoticed by adulthood likely aren&#8217;t severe cases, and because there was practically no incentive to diagnose until the most recent generations, that meant it was diagnosed rarely, making subsequent increases that much more exaggerated.</p><p>The earliest data on autism rates is <em>severely </em>biased and greatly underestimates the prevalence of autism. In fact, all intertemporal comparisons of autism rates are biased for a simple but important reason: the definition of autism has changed!<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><p>Starting with Kanner&#8217;s criteria, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrdd.10029\">autism diagnoses were exceptionally rare with good reason</a>. The rarity of a diagnosis using Kanner&#8217;s criteria has to do with the peculiar conditions the criteria demanded to provide a diagnosis. For example, a child had to show both social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines. The former symptom is usually only observed in the profoundly mentally retarded&#8212;children with IQs that tend to be below 35&#8212;and the latter seemingly requires substantial cognitive ability.</p><p>After the <em>DSM-III</em> became available, clinicians started diagnosing more and more children with the condition: an autism diagnosis was a shiny new tool in the psychiatric arsenal. To qualify for a diagnosis, a child had to be judged as having all of six different criteria, including &#8220;Onset before 30 months of age&#8221;, &#8220;pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people&#8221;, &#8220;gross deficits in language development&#8221;, &#8220;if speech is present, peculiar speech patterns such as immediate and delayed echolalia, metaphorical language, pronominal reversal&#8221;, &#8220;bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment&#8221;, and &#8220;absence of delusions, hallucinations, loosening of associations, and incoherence as in schizophrenia.&#8221;</p><p>These criteria were replaced fourteen years later when the <em>DSM-IV</em> came out. With the new criteria, it became far easier to diagnose someone with autism. Now, instead of having to meet six high bars, one only had to meet six of sixteen lower bars. Instead of having to demonstrate a &#8220;pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people&#8221;, the clinician using the <em>DSM-IV</em> only had to note a &#8220;lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people&#8221;; instead of &#8220;gross deficits in language development&#8221;, children could merely show difficulty &#8220;sustain[ing] a conversation&#8221; or a &#8220;lack of varied spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play&#8221;. The clinician&#8217;s judgment of what&#8217;s &#8220;bizarre&#8221; was even replaced with the far more lax criteria of children showing a &#8220;persistent preoccupation with parts of objects&#8221;. What&#8217;s worse, some of the <em>DSM-IV</em> criteria were practically duplicates of one another, such as &#8220;failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level&#8221; and &#8220;lack of social or emotional reciprocity&#8221;, thus making it even easier to provide someone with an autism diagnosis.</p><p>The two diagnoses contained in the <em>DSM-III</em> (infantile autism and childhood onset pervasive developmental disorder) had also multiplied into five. The new diagnoses included the now-familiar Asperger&#8217;s and the less familiar Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, the latter of which first appeared in the 1987 <em>DSM-III-R</em>, and was defined by non-severe, subthreshold symptoms. The mild variants of autism introduced between the <em>DSM-III </em>and the <em>DSM-IV</em> quickly came to comprise the majority of autism diagnoses and <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231163551\">continue to do so</a>.</p><p>Non-severe autism that was easier to get kids diagnosed paired with increasing efforts to identify kids as having autism. Around 2000, the practice of co-diagnosing autism with other conditions like Down&#8217;s, Tourette&#8217;s, intellectual disability, and cerebral palsy took root in the psychiatric profession. At the same time, widespread recognition that autism could exist at every level of intelligence also gained traction and <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/about/policy/autism-screening-diagnosis-archived.pdf\">efforts to identify the condition in younger children kicked off</a>.</p><p>All of this happened in an environment that demanded the identification of ever more people with all sorts of disabilities. With the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress required schools to make special accommodations for disabled students. Two years later, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or &#8220;IDEA&#8221; from 1990 onwards), leading to the &#8220;Child Find&#8221; mandate, whereby schools were required to actively identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, regardless of severity. With the Child Find mandate in place, each disabled child found led to additional funds for schools, incentivizing them to classify ever more children as having disabilities.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p><p>Given the known loosening of diagnostic criteria, the efforts to identify people who fit the new criteria, novel incentives to diagnose and over-diagnose, the advent of public awareness campaigns and consequently growing public awareness of autism and other disabilities, the question of &#8220;<em><strong>If</strong></em>&#8221; autism rates have <em>really </em>increased should be thought of as at least unsettled, and more likely the default hypothesis should be that changes in autism diagnosis rates reflect changes in diagnostics, laws, and culture rather than real growth in the prevalence of autism in our society.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Did California Prove the Epidemic is Real?</h3><p>One of the most prominent arguments that there is a &#8220;real&#8221; epidemic of autism comes from the a misinterpretation of data by the University of California Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>In 1999, the CDDS reported that autism had increased by almost 273% between 1987 and 1998. The scale of this increase was enough to throw California&#8217;s legislature into high alert and they commissioned M.I.N.D. to ascertain the causes of the increase. In 2002, M.I.N.D. reported there was &#8220;no evidence that a loosening in the diagnostic criteria has contributed to the increase number of autism clients served by [CDDS] Regional Centers&#8221;. The basis of this conclusion was M.I.N.D.&#8217;s reasoning that, since an autistic cohort born between 1983 and 1985 (initially diagnosed with the more restrictive <em>DSM-III</em>) and an autistic cohort born between 1993 and 1995 (initially diagnosed with the less restrictive <em>DSM-IV</em>) were both assessed with the <em>DSM-IV</em> and found to still be diagnosed as autistic, then the &#8220;observed increase in autism cases cannot be explained by a loosening in the criteria used to make the diagnosis&#8221;.</p><p>If that conclusion seems illogical given the procedure, that&#8217;s because it is. If it <em>does not </em>seem illogical to you, then I&#8217;ll borrow <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00334.x\">a well-known explanation of the issue</a> to help you understand that it is.</p><blockquote><p>To understand the fallacy of the conclusion, consider the following analogy, based on male height and graphically illustrated

A diagnostic instrument based on the looser, more recent criterion of 72 in. would identify males who met the 74.5 in criterion. Although a perfectly reliable diagnostic instrument based on a looser criterion would identify 100% of the individuals who meet the looser criterion along with 100% of the individuals who meet the more restricted criterion, a highly reliable instrument might identify about 90% of each group; this is the percentage of each cohort in the California study who met the more recent autism criteria.</p><p>Most crucially, broadening the criterion will result in a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases. For instance, census data allow us to estimate that 2,778 males in McClennan County, Texas would be called tall by the more restricted 74.5-in. criterion, and 10,360 males would be called tall by the broader 72-in. criterion; if these two criteria had been applied a decade apart, a 273% increase in the number of males called tall would have emerged&#8212;without any real increase in Texans&#8217; height. In the same way, the 273% increase from 2,778 versus 10,360 California children who received services for &#8220;autism&#8221; in 1987 versus 1998 could well be a function of broadened criteria.</p></blockquote><p>What these authors argued for is no mere theoretical possibility. An empirical example where we know this happened comes from <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrdd.10029\">studies that have applied Kanner&#8217;s original criteria to more modern samples of autistic children</a>. Children who qualified under Kanner&#8217;s criteria were also classified as autistic by the criteria in more recent versions of the <em>DSM</em>, but only about 40% of the children identified as autistic by <em>DSM </em>criteria met Kanner&#8217;s more stringent criteria for a diagnosis. Similarly, when autism diagnoses became somewhat <em>more difficult </em>to obtain with the release of the <em>DSM-5</em>, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1814891\">researchers observed that about a fifth of the children the CDC&#8217;s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network classified as autistic under </a><em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1814891\">DSM-IV-TR</a></em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1814891\">  criteria did not meet the </a><em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1814891\">DSM-5</a></em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1814891\">&#8217;s criteria for diagnosis</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> Furthermore, the more severe a child&#8217;s <em>DSM-IV-TR</em> diagnosis in terms of the number of criteria they met, the more the two standards agreed.

</em>suggest that rising rates were driven by broader diagnostic criteria, practices, or both. Namely, rates of intellectual impairment were thirty-four percentage points lower in the more recent cohort&#8212;61% earlier and 27% later, a difference equivalent to just over 0.89 <em>d</em> with equivalent population variances and normality in the distribution of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) levels&#8212;and on two out of three dimensions used for autism diagnosis, the later cohort was significantly less symptomatic than the earlier cohort. These findings indicate that the California study found a diagnosis of autism had come to represent something significantly less impactful for people&#8217;s lives in a short period of time, but they nevertheless concluded that diagnosis had not broadened. How? By saying that the difference was not &#8220;clinically significant&#8221;. To return to the height example from earlier:</p><blockquote><p>Comparing two cohorts of males in McClennan County diagnosed according to our more restricted (74.5-in.) versus our broader (72-in.) criterion would probably result in a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts&#8217; average height&#8212;but the difference would be just about an inch (i.e., most likely not a clinically significant difference).</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3>Novel Recording Exaggerates Increases</h3><p>Likely the second most prominent argument for a &#8220;real&#8221; autism epidemic is that the scale of the increase in autism diagnoses is so large it must be real. This belief does not follow from its premises, and frankly, a large increase is biologically implausible whereas a diagnostic change is something we <em>know for a fact </em>can cause major changes in diagnosis numbers. But I digress.</p><p>One of the most common sources for the claim of a massive short-term increase is the data schools collect to report to the Department of Education for IDEA compliance. To quote the Autism Society of America: &#8220;Figures from the most recent U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s 2002 Report to Congress on IDEA reveal that the number of students with autism in America&#8217;s schools jumped an alarming 1,354% in the eight-year period from the school year 1991-92 to 2000-01.&#8221;</p><p>That <em>might </em>be a lot, but not noted in that message: Autism wasn&#8217;t an IDEA report category before 1991-92, and in that year, it was entirely optional for school administrators to use. Every newly-introduced reporting category starts off similarly, being underused compared to the level it will be used at, and likely underused compared to the level it should be used at.</p><p>Morton Gernsbacher has provided other examples of IDEA categories whose usage went up by a large amount for similar reasons as evidence for this proposition. As he noted, from 1991-92 to 2000-01, &#8220;traumatic brain injuries&#8221; grew by 5,059%, and by 2000-01, the category &#8220;developmental delay&#8221; had grown 663% from when it was introduced in 1997-98. These are effects that are not driven by any environmental cause or shift in genetics; there was no mass outbreak of people being smacked across the head that had coincidentally started in the year it became possible to report that sort of thing. These changes are <em>just</em> about increased use of a reporting category after it becomes available&#8212;a pure shift in reporting. This is common; Gernsbacher:</p><blockquote><p>After the initial year, the number of children reported under the IDEA category of autism has increased by approximately 23% annually. Why the continuing annual increase? As is the case with new options in the marketplace, like cellular phones and high-speed Internet, new reporting categories in the annual child count are not capitalized upon instantaneously; they require incrementally magnified awareness and augmentation or reallocation of resources.</p></blockquote><p>As an example of this, note Massachusetts&#8217; IDEA reporting and how it&#8217;s changed over time. From 1992 to 2001, they had the country&#8217;s lowest rate, at only about 0.4-0.5 per 1,000 children. But in 2002, the rate they reported went up by 400% in a single year as a result of the choice to start actually counting the number of students with disabilities rather than attempting to calculate their number from a ratio based on the proportion of students belonging to each disability category in 1992.</p><p>Massachusetts was responsible and sensible and they <em>did not </em>claim that the massive one-year increase in autism reports meant autism had actually become far more common in a single year. Instead, they explained to Congress that the numbers would keep going up by large amounts for several years as &#8220;districts better understand how to submit their data at the student level&#8221; and &#8220;all districts comply completely with the new reporting methods.&#8221; This same sort of thing has happened all across the country.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Lines Going Up Together</h3><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-018-3670-2\">Yet another</a> <a href=\"https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-069X-13-73\">prominent argument</a> that there&#8217;s a &#8220;real&#8221; autism epidemic is that age-resolved snapshots of autism rates and constant-age tracking estimates substantially agree.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><p>Age-resolved snapshots are cross-sectional profiles of the prevalence of autism by age. Constant-age tracking estimates are time series prevalences for successive cohorts all measured at the same age. The idea is that if the slopes are the same, then the rise must be real, because the reference age used in the constant-age tracking estimates will be one that&#8217;s a good proxy for cumulative incidence. Age-resolved snapshots are intended to better isolate birth-cohort risk because they dampen period diagnostic noise, whereas constant-age tracking gives the &#8220;how many people of a certain age need services&#8221; answer, at least in theory.</p><p>But both slopes are affected by common forces. Consider it like this:</p><div class=\"latex-rendered\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;persistentExpression&quot;:&quot;P_{\\\\text{measured}}(\\\\text{age},\\\\text{birth-cohort})=P_{\\\\text{true}}(\\\\text{birth-cohort})\\\\times\\\\underbrace{\\\\Pr(\\\\text{case has been identified by that age})}_{\\\\text{Detection Function}}&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;TCPGEBHXEU&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"LatexBlockToDOM\"></div><p>If P_{true} is actually constant, any systematic increase in the detection function will make <em>both </em>the age-resolved snapshot <em>and </em>the constant-age tracking series rise. There are many things that will affect both slopes, and likely to similar degrees.</p><p><strong>Earlier and more aggressive case-finding</strong>.

Additionally, lowering the typical age at diagnosis further is frequently requested by researchers and advocates, for the sake of autistic children who might do better if they receive care at a younger age. Many researchers have recognized that this makes a contribution to autism rates. <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/2009/01000/the_rise_in_autism_and_the_role_of_age_at.16.aspx\">For births in California in 1990 versus 2001</a>, for example, 12% of the rise in autism diagnosis rates was explicable by a falling age at diagnosis alone.

This sounds absurd, but it was a view voiced in the recent autism press conference at the HHS. I&#8217;ll explain.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709650243\">Between 1984 and 1985</a>, researchers in North Dakota contacted &#8220;all relevant health and service providers&#8221; in the state and asked them &#8220;to provide names and records of all patients who had autistic symptoms&#8221;. The identified patients were between the ages of two and eighteen, and after getting in touch, they were provided with a comprehensive evaluation. During that evaluation, it was observed that twenty-one met <em>DSM-III </em>criteria for autism, two met the criteria for childhood onset pervasive developmental disorder (COPDD), and thirty-six were diagnosed with atypical pervasive developmental disorder. Thus, the prevalence for North Dakota was estimated at 1.16 per 10,000 for autism, 0.11 per 10,000 for COPDD, and 1.99 per 10,000 for APDD, for an overall pervasive developmental disorder rate of 3.26 per 10,000.</p><p>The way this study was understood by RFK Jr. was extremely differently from its reality. His remarks were as follows:</p><blockquote><p>In 1987, it was another exhaustive study, a peer-reviewed study in North Dakota. Set out to county every child in the state with a pervasive developmental disorder including autism. That study meticulously combed through every record, every diagnosis, and even conducted in-person assessments of the entire population of 180,000 children under 18. The autism rate they found was 3.3 per 10,000. That&#8217;s in line with the 1 in 10,000 that was found in Wisconsin 17 years earlier.</p><p>For context, today the last number of 1 in 36 is 83 times higher. In 1987, out of every one million kids, 330 were diagnosed with autism. Today there are 27,777 for every million.</p><p>If you accept the epidemic denier&#8217;s narrative, you have to believe that researchers in North Dakota missed 98.8% of the children with autism. Thousands of profoundly disabled children were somehow invisible to doctors, teachers, parents, and even their own study. The same researchers who followed the original cohort for 12 years double-checked their number. They went back in 2000 and found that they had missed exactly one child.</p><p>So doctors and therapists in the past were not stupid. They weren&#8217;t missing all these cases. The epidemic is real.</p></blockquote><p>Practically every detail RFK Jr. provided during this section was incorrect or a misunderstanding. My suspicion is that someone on his team wrote these remarks for him and he believed what he was told. That person must have either been ignorant or severely biased, because they cannot have written this given what the study actually was. RFK Jr. should fire them for misleading him into spouting misinformation in an official statement of the HHS.</p><p>For one, the study was not as exhaustive as RFK Jr. was misled into believing it was. The researchers would have liked to detect every child in the state who had the conditions they were screening for, but they relied on recorded cases in the few years after the introduction of the <em>DSM-III</em>, before widespread recognition of autism. Moreover, the authors only contacted providers and asked them to refer patients to them for interviews, and there was no verification of the quality of those reports. Without the force of law behind them, there is no reason to suspect each provider would have provided all of their cases. Given the time the study took place, they certainly did not have adequate records, either, for financial and diagnostic reasons I&#8217;ve already gone into above. Contrary to what RFK Jr. was told, the researchers <em>did not </em>personally go out to do interviews with every child in the state either.</p><p>For two, the original study did not estimate the autism rate as 3.3 per 10,000. That&#8217;s what they estimated the overall pervasive developmental disorder rate at. This may seem to favor RFK Jr.&#8217;s point even more, but why this is relevant is unclear since the practices and funding for diagnosis and awareness of autism then differ radically from today.</p><p>For three, since we know their original estimate was an <em>under</em>-estimate, it&#8217;s not clear what value is supposed to be provided by mentioning the follow-ups. Well, maybe. The follow-ups do provide <em>some</em> value, but not for reasons stated by RFK Jr. In <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/088307380201700906\">the follow-up</a>, the researchers got in touch with just fifty-two of the original fifty-nine subjects. Ten declined to participate, leaving data for forty-two to work with. The researchers who did this follow-up did not, as RFK Jr. stated, find that they missed a child, because they did not do any novel discovery. The only time &#8216;just one child&#8217; came up in the study, it was that one child had died between ascertainment and follow-up. The other forty-one whose data were revisited were found to generally show lower severity compared to their earlier assessment, with a 20% reduction using the criteria of the <em>DSM-III-R</em>, and a 23% reduction using the <em>DSM-IV</em>. Also: &#8220;Global Assessment of Functioning improved 19%, and the average number of comorbidities decreased 45%. Thirty-seven percent of patients improved in all four measures, whereas only 5% improved in only one measure.&#8221;</p><p>What value this data <em>might </em>provide to RFK Jr. is that it might reinforce his case about how dramatic the incline in autism identification has been, because it na&#239;vely seems likely that profound cases have increased even more dramatically given this baseline. But the reality is that severe cases were seriously underidentified, so it cannot really do that. We know this data is being misunderstood for many reasons.</p><ul><li><p>North Dakota still had asylums, and as the autism researcher and UCLA professor Edward Ritvo noted in his newsletter &#8220;No Epidemic of Autism&#8221;, these were important at the time. North Dakota had only just begun shutting down its asylums as it entered the 1980s, and the common practice then was to &#8220;warehouse&#8221; autistic people who had been &#8220;improperly diagnosed and housed.&#8221; This accounts for many of the most severe cases being missing from the sample and much of the rest of the country in this period.</p></li><li><p>Co-diagnosis of autism and other disorders was not common until many years after the period 1984-85 in which the children were ascertained. If the children had a more severe disorder or&#8212;in many cases&#8212;even a less severe one that excludes an autism diagnosis, they would likely have been diagnosed with that alone rather than with infantile autism.</p></li><li><p>The age-range for the sample prohibits credible diagnosis for most cases. To be referred into the sample, the diagnosis had to have been logged before the researchers contacted the provider in 1984-85, and the <em>DSM-III</em> had only just come out in 1980.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-15\" href=\"#footnote-15\" target=\"_self\">15</a> Furthermore, the <em>DSM-III</em> criteria used required onset before thirty months of age, and the style of retrospective diagnosis required was and remains rare and impractical. Due to the diagnostic criteria in use in the study, most ages of child who could have theoretically been in the sample had to be seriously underdiagnosed.</p></li><li><p>Dakota is a state that is very White relative to the rest of the country, and the whole country used to be considerably more White than it is now. Recently, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-020-04460-0\">the increase in autism diagnoses</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-024-06403-5\">has been greater for non-White persons</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-16\" href=\"#footnote-16\" target=\"_self\">16</a> This suggests underdiagnosis of non-Whites is something that used to be quite prominent, but more relevantly, it speaks to the need to demographically adjust future estimates to make them comparable to ones from the past. Even more importantly, it speaks to issues with the CDC ADDM&#8217;s&#8212;RFK Jr.&#8217;s primary reference&#8212;identification of the profoundly autistic. Non-Whites tend to have lower IQs than Whites, and a profound diagnosis can occur on the basis of an IQ score equal to or below 50 alone.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-17\" href=\"#footnote-17\" target=\"_self\">17</a> The increase in non-White diagnoses that likely stems from better service provisioning and reduced rates of neglect for diagnosis and other psychiatric services in their communities has thus elevated the rate of <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/153828779/countries-cant-have-mean-iqs-in-the-s\">profound diagnoses </a><em><a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/153828779/countries-cant-have-mean-iqs-in-the-s\">without adaptive behavior deficits</a></em>&#8212;profound diagnoses in name alone! <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2015762117\">The same thing has happened across class lines</a>, as autism has gone from a wealthy family diagnosis to one that&#8217;s becoming more common in poor families.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-18\" href=\"#footnote-18\" target=\"_self\">18</a></p></li><li><p>Diagnostic substitution has resulted in increases in the number of profound cases on the basis of intellectual disability and shifting people with serious non-autism disorders into being classified as autistic. It is not that profound cases were missed <em>per se</em>, it is that definitions have indisputably radically changed.</p></li><li><p>People have started to lie to receive diagnoses. People seek out diagnoses, even as adults, in order to acquire greater levels of service for their children, and to receive <a href=\"https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ps.202000144\">additional welfare benefits for themselves</a>. As the popularity of autism has increased via social media, more people have begun to self-diagnose<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-19\" href=\"#footnote-19\" target=\"_self\">19</a> and to seek out professional diagnoses as well.</p></li><li><p>The 1-in-36 and 1-in-31 figures do not refer to severe cases, they refer to all cases, increasingly many of which are non-profound.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-20\" href=\"#footnote-20\" target=\"_self\">20</a> Talking about this change as if it represents an increase in profound autism alone that could not have possibly been missed, or as if symptom levels within the profound and non-profound categories haven&#8217;t fallen, or even talking about it as if it&#8217;s something that <em>needs to be diagnosed</em> for those affected to live a normal life is <em>profoundly</em> in error.</p></li></ul><div><hr></div><h3>There&#8217;s So Much Evidence Favoring Diagnostic Change</h3><h4>Policy Change</h4><p>We can be certain that autism rates have gone up for artefactual reasons&#8212;diagnosis, changing awareness and incentives, etc. rather than real increases in the number of people with autism&#8212;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-023-00423-0\">by exploiting policy changes</a>. For example, above, I mentioned the Massachusetts saw autism reports increase 400% in one year due to a change in school reporting. Similarly, when states implement a policy of rewarding school districts for diagnoses, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570677X22000843\">diagnoses immediately rise by about 25%</a>. The underlying prevalence doesn&#8217;t shift, the incentives to diagnose do, simple as that.</p><p>Something similar happens when autism insurance mandates are put into effect. When insurers are legally compelled to provide treatments for children with autism, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/edfp/article-abstract/20/1/110/118035/The-Academic-and-Behavioral-Impacts-of-an-Autism\">the number of people diagnosed with autism increases right away</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2532586\">One study</a> looked at mandates that affected children covered by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana between 2008 and 2012. States that implemented the mandates initially had a diagnosis prevalence of 1.8 per 1,000, but after a year of the mandates, that crept up by 0.17, then by 0.27 in the second year, and by 0.29 in the third. The effect of a mandate in this period was a roughly 16% increase in the number diagnosed over trend.</p><p>This result was entirely predicted by the insurers and is a major reason why they attempted to prevent the mandates from being enacted. Supporting the arguments of insurers about run-away cost growth, a related finding is that when these mandates are placed on them, <a href=\"https://www.jaacap.org/article/S0890-8567(12)00418-2/abstract\">families shift from public to privately funded insurance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2017.0515\">people shift towards using considerably more services</a>, but <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/abstract/2018/03000/the_differential_effects_of_insurance_mandates_on.6.aspx\">the evidence on spending increases is not unambiguous, and the amount of the increase varies considerably by initial spending levels</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-21\" href=\"#footnote-21\" target=\"_self\">21</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890856717318671\">Age caps on mandates also help to limit spending</a>.</p><h4>Correlate Drift</h4><p>Meta-analytically, the meaning of autism has drifted in terms of the things it correlates with. As noted above, we know this is true for demographic correlates like race and class, and it&#8217;s becoming ever more true for sex as well.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-22\" href=\"#footnote-22\" target=\"_self\">22</a> But some correlates are more biologically proximal, and those too have drifted. For example, emotion recognition and theory of mind deficits? Down in more recent cohorts. Cognitive flexibility and planning problems? Diminished. P3b amplitudes and brain volumes? Not as exaggerated in autism any longer!</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1107.6923076923076\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1344,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:258455,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/161498315?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Lvag!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb08a157-6546-403e-8f36-0e8819e075f1_2055x1897.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2747847\">R&#248;dgaard et al. 2019, Figure 2</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>All of this means that autism is becoming less like what we might&#8217;ve once known autism to be.

Autism is a business, no matter how bad that sounds to say. The place providers do their diagnosing indexes characteristics of the providers and of the quality of the diagnosis, the cases, etc. as well. With that said, we know that, in some times and places, a large part of the increase in diagnoses can be chalked up to increased use of outpatient diagnosis. In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/1919642\">this Danish example</a>, about 40% of the increase in reported autism prevalence could be chalked up to the inclusion of outpatient contacts alone. A further third could be attributed to diagnostic change alone, and together, those factors explained about 60% of the increase.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-23\" href=\"#footnote-23\" target=\"_self\">23</a></p><p>One of the more influential settings affecting autism diagnoses is probably going to be <em>proximity to autistic people</em>. People learn socially, and many of them have learned about their own autism from the experience of encountering their autistic friends or seeing autism mentioned online. Many parents have learned that their kids might have autism from seeing their kids&#8217; friends. <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/651448\">A brilliant study</a> using data from California provided perhaps the best evidence for this sort of effect.</p><p>These authors had access to California&#8217;s Birth Statistical Master Files and they used that data alongside the CDDS&#8217; autism diagnosis data to track thousands of people who had autism and their siblings longitudinally, even through residential moves. With this data in hand, it becomes possible to test whether living physically near someone diagnosed with autism increases the odds of a child being themselves diagnosed. It does. The probability of being diagnosed significantly increases the closer a family is to another child diagnosed with autism.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\"

this finding was not driven by underlying time trends, whereby, due to the rising prevalence of autism, &#8220;proximity to the nearest child with autism has increased over time simply because there are more children with autism.&#8221; They then ruled out population density by refitting the model with a median split, finding that the effect held up. This is pretty critical, since it suggests toxicant-based explanations have to affect both urban and rural areas. Their fixed-effects model also rules out non-time-varying toxicant sources.</p><p>The proximity effect on diagnosis also seems to be qualified by the type of autism. Namely, it leads to a larger increase in autism of the moderate-to-high functioning variety than of the low-functioning variety. The source of the referral for diagnosis also seems to be correlated based on proximity. Meaning, if the nearest child diagnosed with autism got referred by, say, a physician or hospital, then it&#8217;s more likely that the child now being referred was referred by the same source. With this in mind, the authors&#8217; found suggestive evidence that the culprit&#8212;or savior?&#8212;could be school districts, as the effect only tended to show up when children were close but shared the same school district. Unfortunately, the samples that were close but in different districts were small, so that finding has to be viewed tentatively. But what doesn&#8217;t is the effect of moving.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800.2747252747253\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:150115,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/161498315?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CsTd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8eaf28af-edf5-4384-b012-4eef9209ede9_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Leveraging this data, we can compute a causally-informed estimate of <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/lying-for-climate-crusading\">the population-attributable fraction</a> (PAF) of autism cases due to proximity effects. In this study, 40% of people were exposed in the sense of having an autistic child living within 500 meters of their home, and the effect was considerable, leading us to a PAF of 16%. In other words, 16% of autism cases can be attributed to living near other children with autism, for whatever set of reasons, from sharing a school district on down to living near the same hospitals or even an effect of cultural-geographic clustering. Additionally, bringing the quality of Medi-Cal coverage up&#8212;or lowering it down?&#8212;to the level of other insurance plans in this period would have increased diagnoses by another 13% due to the underdiagnosis effects of coverage for the poor or the overdiagnosis effects of other plans. The jury is out on how to interpret that effect.</p><h4>Repeat This Point</h4><p>Everything I&#8217;ve talked about so far is quite beside the point. A single piece of evidence indicates that there is no real epidemic of autism. As remarked in a review in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0138-4\">a 2020 </a><em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0138-4\">Nature Reviews Disease Primers</a></em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41572-019-0138-4\"> article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>No significant evidence is available supporting that autism is rarer in older people, which provides further evidence against the suggestion that autism is increasing in prevalence over time.</p></blockquote><p>The most major misconception in attempts to diagnose the causes and reality of the &#8220;autism epidemic&#8221; is this: <em>that it&#8217;s much more common among kids than adults.</em></p><p>If you&#8217;ve read this far, you&#8217;ll no doubt have realized that the difference in diagnosis rates between children and adults stems from the former being exposed to a far greater level of novel identification criteria and practices, because autism is supposed to be diagnosed early. Active case-finding expeditions virtually all concern children and children alone, with adults given short shrift and, at best, being classified as autistic based on their rare opportunities to obtain a diagnosis earlier in life, or through self-selection.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/epidemiology-of-autism-in-adults-across-age-groups-and-ability-levels/D4F48E07D1002DE6F75A67FF9A4FFCF7\">When researchers go out of their way to screen adults</a> based on ICD-10/<em>DSM-IV</em> criteria, they observe an autism rate of just over 1%. <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(06)69041-7/abstract\">When the same methods are used by researchers who go out of their way to screen children</a>, they observe an autism rate of just over 1%. If you were to use more or less expansive criteria, you would almost-certainly still find the same rates among the young and the old, albeit with a bias for very old ages due to survival deficits associated with autism and difficulties reliably reaching old people.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-25\" href=\"#footnote-25\" target=\"_self\">25</a> In truth, the concordance in rates across ages is a lucky coincidence of the expansion of autism, because it is extremely unlikely that many autistic individuals would survive to old age were they classified under Kanner&#8217;s criteria as opposed to the more modern, looser definitions in use today.</p><p>Some of the most &#8216;slam-dunk&#8217; evidence comes from places like Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, which have population registers. These registers provide them with lots of information about people that could be used for understanding if there&#8217;s been diagnostic runaway without a similar increase in autism symptom levels. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1961\">using Swedish data</a>, we can see that there was no significant time-trend for measured symptom scores (<em>p</em> = 0.85), but there was a highly-significant and highly-positive time trend for autism diagnoses (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800.2747252747253\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:339196,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/161498315?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!iBTj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55ba24f3-91d6-45e7-9c31-9b9c9b6a77a4_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Diagnoses are simply not a workable criteria for understanding prevalence without explicit and credible attempts to go out and find everyone who fits different diagnoses. The autism prevalence for Swedish kids based on symptom score measurements? A consistent 0.95% that didn&#8217;t significantly and systematically go up or down! But the diagnoses nevertheless just kept going, more than doubling between 1993 and 2002. But this doubling still wasn&#8217;t up to snuff, because the diagnosis numbers never actually met the known community prevalence of autism, and, as you now know, that prevalence drifts based on how strictly or loosely you define autism.</p><div><hr></div><p>So remember this:</p><p>There is not, and has never been, any credible evidence for a &#8220;real&#8221; epidemic of autism or for any of its proposed environmental causes. Answering the question of <em><strong>if </strong></em>there is a &#8220;real&#8221; autism epidemic has provided a complete answer to the question of <em><strong>why</strong></em> there might be.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Non-Causes and How To Avoid Them</h3><p>People have proposed tons of explanations for rising autism rates. These have almost all been careless attempts, since they have reasoned from the existence of a &#8220;real&#8221; epidemic, and thus about something to be explained in terms of increasing exposures. People have tried to argue for all sorts of out-there causes that imply we&#8217;re mismanaging our health systems, giving out drugs too willy-nilly, getting infected <em>en masse</em> and just generally being imbeciles about toxins in ways that are counter-indicated by real data.</p><p>I&#8217;ve previously mentioned now-falsified examples of proposed causes like <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1779615432015536300\">acetaminophen use during pregnancy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/wanted-more-maternal-health-research\">epidural use at birth, and infection during pregnancy</a>. More recently, people have proposed ultrasound use during pregnancy as something to fear (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ppe.12998\">it&#8217;s not supported</a>), and much more popularly, lots of people believe the rise in diagnoses&#8212;or, per them, <em>the real rise in autism</em>&#8212;is driven by vaccination.</p><p>The theory that autism is driven by vaccines makes no biological sense, fails to comport with the well-known extreme heritability of autism, and <em>predicts </em>nonsensical things given the expansion in diagnosis rates over time. For example, if vaccination has driven the expansions in rates, then it should have highly nonlinear effects: when vaccines are added to the childhood vaccination schedule, the overwhelming majority of people get them immediately, so why does the autism diagnosis rate keep climbing steadily? Without an accompanying rise in autism rates in the year vaccines are introduced, or in way that&#8217;s consistent with actual vaccine uptake, there&#8217;s no statistical plausibility to the autism-vaccine link. That <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M18-2101\">there simply is no statistical link in large cohorts is therefore unsurprising</a>. That there is <em>definitely </em>no causal link, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444\">as discerned with sibling studies</a>, is doubly unsurprising.</p><div

vaccine-autism link refuses to die in a large part of the public&#8217;s imagination. Some part of this is because people want it to be true. A not-insignificant number of parents even <em>feel</em> that there&#8217;s a lot of truth in it, because they&#8217;ve fallen for the old fallacy that, because something happened after something else, they must&#8217;ve isolated the cause.</p><p>In many cases, this happens because parents are looking for an explanation for why they just started to notice their child was autistic, and they&#8217;re happy to chalk it up to vaccines and well visits. People go so far in looking for support that they <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1887556273517781075\">flat-out misread studies on the alleged harms of vaccination</a> and they fall into theory rabbit holes, where the link is supported because they believe in some mechanism behind it.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-26\" href=\"#footnote-26\" target=\"_self\">26</a> Mercury content, thimerosal, and vaccination in general have all had mechanisms proposed to explain their association with autism, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1868778651543826668\">and they&#8217;ve all failed</a>, probably because there&#8217;s no association between vaccination and autism in the first place.</p><p>Plainly, if you want to avoid falling into the same traps, think causally and eschew consideration of &#8220;evidence&#8221; presented by people who cannot reason in terms of standard evidence like trials, large cohort studies, the rapidly expanding number of causal cross-sectional studies (i.e., DiDs, RDDs, IVs, etc.), and realistic animal evidence.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-27\" href=\"#footnote-27\" target=\"_self\">27</a> When a hypothesis is supported by conspiracy theorizing and cross-sectional associations that don&#8217;t replicate or can be seen to be due to confounding, then drop it and the person proposing them.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-28\" href=\"#footnote-28\" target=\"_self\">28</a> The person pushing the idea likely wants to convince you more than they want to be right, and you should let them know you know that by ignoring them.

These are</p><ol><li><p><strong>Older parents.</strong> The age at first marriage and the age at first childbirth are increasing, and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01753-x\">this seems to have a causal effect on children&#8217;s risk of autism</a>. Could this be environmental, driven by the womb? Maybe, but since the paternal age effect is larger, it seems like the age-related accumulation of mutations in sperm will be more likely to take the blame.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-30\" href=\"#footnote-30\" target=\"_self\">30</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Our increasingly awesome healthcare systems. </strong>People who would never have survived childbirth or early childhood in previous generations are surviving nowadays at historically unprecedented rates. The examples range from those with major congenital defects to people with minor, but <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/128/2/344/30617/Perinatal-and-Neonatal-Risk-Factors-for-Autism-A\">still risk-disposing issues, like autism</a>.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-31\" href=\"#footnote-31\" target=\"_self\">31</a></p></li></ol><p>We keep young people alive today better than we ever have, and that means that people who have historically been at-risk of an early death are being kept alive well beyond where they would have been historically. This might not mean much for the people who receive mild autism diagnoses, but it can mean a lot for those who receive profound diagnoses, since they are at the greatest risk of an early demise.</p><p>I think that, though this increases the societal burden of the incapable to some degree, it is still to be lauded, because their lives still have value. The families broken up by having to raise these kids may be worse off, and there may be some calculus through which our medical advances are bad for society, but it&#8217;ll take a lot to move me from the position of valuing the lives of even the profoundly disabled.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-32\" href=\"#footnote-32\" target=\"_self\">32</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Opinionated Readings</h3><p>Here is where I voice my pleasurable agreement with RFK Jr.&#8217;s recent speech about autism. Near the end, he noted that the cost of medical care for autism are set to balloon over $1 trillion annually by 2035. This estimate seems credible and I take no issue with it. In fact, if a pro-diagnosis radical works their position into the next iteration of the <em>DSM</em> or the AMA succeeds in destroying prior authorization, the costs will probably be far greater.</p><p>This is why I have tried to avoid or qualify &#8220;under-&#8221; and &#8220;overdiagnosis&#8221; in addition to avoiding calling diagnostic change &#8220;good&#8221;. Change in diagnostic criteria and clinical practice can be &#8220;good&#8221; with respect to equating rates across age and demographic groups when diagnosis disparities are driven by bias, and it can be good for identifying people who genuinely need care. But we have to face this trio of facts:</p><ol><li><p>We diagnose way too many people with autism that&#8217;s so mild it doesn&#8217;t need treatment.</p></li><li><p>So much spending on care for autistic people is wasteful. Someone with a mild case of Asperger&#8217;s does not need to hit a mandated spending cap for their condition, and someone with mental retardation whose caretakers convinced a clinician to give them a more favorable diagnosis should not be receiving treatment intended for autistics and found to be useless for the merely mentally retarded.</p></li><li><p>We have pathologized normal-range behavior.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-33\" href=\"#footnote-33\" target=\"_self\">33</a></p></li></ol><p>The first two points speak for themselves. The latter is one that must be reiterated.</p><p>So many aspects of normal child&#8212;and particularly <em>male</em>&#8212;behavior have been turned into issues that demand psychiatric attention, and this has been done intentionally. I am actually awestruck by the fact that RFK Jr. has not fired the head of the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Mental Health, one Judith Rapoport, who was once quoted as saying:</p><blockquote><p>I'll call a kid a zebra if it will get him the educational services I think he needs.</p></blockquote><p>To most people, admitting that you&#8217;ll lie to get someone diagnosed with a condition because you see a need should be a cause for alarm. Would you trust the psychiatrist telling you they&#8217;ll lie to get you services? Maybe, because you want those services, but would you like to pay for the same treatment for a million other kids? And if the next year, none of the kids deserve that treatment but they&#8217;re getting diagnosed anyway, do you want to foot the bill?</p><p>That the diagnostic situation has now evolved to the point where too many people are receiving services they do not need is now so well-evidenced that debate is hard to fathom and cutting the fat is more than warranted. I wish RFK Jr. all the luck in the world in these efforts, and if he wants a succinct, well-supported report on how to do the cuts without cutting care for the kids who really need it, he has my number.</p><div><hr></div><h3>We Must Get This Right</h3><p>We have a moral duty to get this right.

Plenty of people followed bad science and poor reasoning&#8212;likely in many cases <em>desperately, </em>and understandably&#8212;to the point where apparently about 7% of autistic people had been given a harmful, often painful, and&#8212;for autistics&#8212;difficult to endure treatment to remove heavy metals from their body in the hopes that it would treat their condition. This did not work. All it did was cost a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of relationships between parents and autistic children, and it hurt people who often wouldn&#8217;t know anything about what was going on.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-34\" href=\"#footnote-34\" target=\"_self\">34</a></p><p>If bad science leads people to avoiding epidurals, a lot of mothers are going to needlessly suffer through birth. If bad science leads people to avoiding acetaminophen, a lot of people are going to live their lives with more pain than they would have otherwise. If bad science leads people to avoiding vaccines, a lot of kids are going to suffer, a lot of kids are going to die, and a lot of parents are going to wonder why they ever believed it was better to have a dead child than an autistic one.</p><p>There is no &#8220;autism epidemic&#8221; and there never was. There are no responsible toxins to remove from the food supply or chemicals to purge from the water or the air.

They noted that the number of auxiliary health workers increased in lock-step with the number of autism diagnoses. A 100% increase in autism cases increased their wages over non-autism health occupations by 8-11%, and boosted the number of providers by 9-14%. They found that a third of new autism diagnoses were simply replacing mental retardation diagnoses, but argued that this wasn&#8217;t happening for other disorders.</p><p>While this study is interesting and it was able to show evidence for diagnostic substitution, it suffers from some major flaws in reasoning. Namely, the authors seem to think that the residual of their substitution-driven increase was a real increase. They thought this because, they reasoned, auxiliary health providers cannot diagnose people, so they cannot induce demand. But this is a bizarre supposition. Just because you cannot directly diagnose, you cannot induce demand? Nurses induce demand for medication in states where they can&#8217;t access the prescription pad. I see no reason to think the same can&#8217;t be true here. Furthermore, the wages and labor supply of auxiliary health providers can increase for many more reasons than actual need for them. As an example where that happens, think of unions, or about how many people were needlessly hired into real estate offices before the Great Recession.</p><p>Related to this study, other works supports the idea that more providers are hired when more money flows towards autism. For example, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10803-021-05044-2\">Medicaid expansions lead to more hiring of child psychiatrists and board-certified behavioral analysts</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-15\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-15\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">15</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The date of release for the <em>DSM-III</em> is also part of why we know the Wisconsin data RFK Jr. mentioned is irrelevant for reasons I&#8217;ve already explained.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-16\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-16\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">16</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Part of this likely reflects <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/jrnldbp/fulltext/2021/11000/racial,_ethnic,_and_sociodemographic_disparities.11.aspx\">known difficulties diagnosing Blacks and Hispanics</a>.

Cases classified as profound by the CDC tend to shift towards being non-profound with age due to the natural increase in cognitive ability as kids age up. Since the ADDM reports prevalences at ages four and eight, their surveillance leaves considerable room for cases categorized as profound on the basis of IQ scores to shift towards being non-profound.</p><p>Reports from the ADDM often seem to recognize this. In <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/ss/ss7402a1.htm\">the most recent one</a>, they wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, the surveillance case definition of intellectual disability is not the same as a clinical diagnosis; IQ measurements in young children might lack stability and do not necessarily mean children have received a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Current diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability require documentation of adaptive behavior impairments, but adaptive assessments often are not present in children&#8217;s records.</p></blockquote><p>It is also worth noting that the ADDM data necessarily reflect reporting biases because they are based on reporting done in different states using different diagnostic criteria, which lead to predictable variation in rates across state lines. The states also have access to different data to report up, and the sourcing of this data affects the rate of diagnoses. For example, California, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wisconsin provided IDEA Part C Early Intervention data, which, as Footnote 11 notes, come with elevated rates of diagnosis. Some data sources, like Medicaid, were purely administrative and lacked developmental evaluations.</p><p>Or, in summation, there was variation in reporting sources, practices, and policies across states, and these predictably affect rates within ADDM sampling years, including the most recent one. This fact should be a lesson to those who cite the ADDM&#8217;s data as an indication of a &#8220;real&#8221; autism epidemic.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-21\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-21\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">21</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Though these mandates might appear to wastefully increase diagnoses, that might not be the case.

Sweden has good screening for autism, free healthcare, etc., and I suspect the HDI association just reflects comorbidity with lower IQ, as in America with Blacks and Hispanics with autism being more likely to be classified as severely or profoundly autistic for IQ reasons despite not showing adaptive behavior deficits as often as comparably low-IQ White children diagnosed with autism.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-24\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-24\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">24</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Interestingly, distance also has a marginally-significant <em>negative </em>effect on sole diagnosis with mental retardation, indicating diagnostic substitution from that to autism.

Or maybe when an official in the area diagnoses someone with autism, they&#8217;re more likely to do the same for others too. There are many possibilities to explain this potentiality, but it should also be noted that comorbid autism plus mental retardation significantly increases with proximity, so perhaps parents of mentally retarded children also seek out an autism diagnosis based on awareness or other proximity-related factors.</p><p>The authors also found that in this period, families with lower socioeconomic status got diagnosed considerably less often.

Quote:</p><blockquote><p>Our CI for age is consistent with a percentage increase in prevalence of 4% or a percentage decrease of 6% per year of age. [i.e., a non-significant age effect] Small reductions of prevalence with age could be explained by increased mortality in autism or by older respondents being less available to participate in a household survey because of loss of family support or increased use of institutionalization. However, based on the literature reviewed earlier, we would expect substantially lower rates in earlier birth cohorts (older respondents) if rates of ASD have been rising considerably during recent decades, and we would also expect lower rates in younger adults than in recent childhood surveys using the ADOS-4. We did not find this. Overall, our findings suggest that prevalence is neither rising nor falling significantly.</p><p>This favors the interpretation that methods of ascertainment have changed in more recent surveys of children compared with the earliest surveys in which the rates reported were considerably lower. Our data suggest that the causes of autism appear to be temporally constant and that recent apparent rises in rates of diagnosis must therefore reflect better survey case finding rather than some new environmental toxin.</p></blockquote><p>Comparable diagnosis rates are obtained even using similar population-general criteria in an environment where children should be expected to receive more diagnoses, such as in the NHS&#8217; <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231226135219/https://files.digital.nhs.uk/FB/8EA993/MHCYP%202017%20Less%20Common%20Disorders.pdf\">Mental Health of Children and Young People in England</a> </em>(1.2%) and the<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241222190447/https://files.digital.nhs.uk/pdf/1/o/adult_psychiatric_study_ch6_web.pdf\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241222190447/https://files.digital.nhs.uk/pdf/1/o/adult_psychiatric_study_ch6_web.pdf\">Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey</a> </em>(0.8%, values not significantly different). <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/10/e003219\">By 2010,</a> administrative diagnosis rates had not yet reached this community prevalence.

      "script_text": "One of the major priorities of the new Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.), is to figure out why rates of autism have been increasing over time.\nBut is this a good priority? To determine why autism rates have increased, we first have to know if autism rates have increased. There’s some evidence that speaks to that. For example, diagnosed rates of autism have clearly increased over time across every major data collection effort. If we look at recent snapshot data from one such effort conducted by the California Department of Developmental Services (CDDS), we can see that autism diagnoses have stunningly increased since the 1930s, from applying to 0.001% of those in 1931 to 1.2% of five-year-olds in 2021.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSee this study to understand this chart.\nDespite the striking and shocking nature of the data on this graph, interpreting it as evidence that autism has increased over time is hard.\nFor starters, the ages in the most recent cohorts are young—they’re children—but in the oldest cohorts, we’re talking about adults whose data wasn’t gathered by the CDDS when they were kids, but instead much later, long after these people had made it to adulthood, when diagnosis is frequently neglected. 1 Autism is also associated with shorter lifespans, which are even shorter for the people with the most severe manifestations of the condition. Accordingly, many of the oldest autistics would have already died off by the time the CDDS got around to surveying. These biases deflate the rate of autism the further back you go, exaggerating the subsequent increase.\nThe other, more pressing issue is that the constellation of traits categorized as “autism” wasn’t named until Leo Kanner’s descriptions of “abnormal behaviour” in the 1940s, and it would be another nearly forty years before American psychiatry provided criteria for autism diagnoses in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders( DSM-III). 2 Before the DSM-III came out in 1980, autism diagnoses were usually ad hoc, based on the personal views of different clinicians and researchers about what autism is and how to diagnose it. Because autism was regarded as particularly severe prior to the DSM treatment of it and those whose condition goes unnoticed by adulthood likely aren’t severe cases, and because there was practically no incentive to diagnose until the most recent generations, that meant it was diagnosed rarely, making subsequent increases that much more exaggerated.\nThe earliest data on autism rates is severely biased and greatly underestimates the prevalence of autism. In fact, all intertemporal comparisons of autism rates are biased for a simple but important reason: the definition of autism has changed! 3\nStarting with Kanner’s criteria, autism diagnoses were exceptionally rare with good reason. The rarity of a diagnosis using Kanner’s criteria has to do with the peculiar conditions the criteria demanded to provide a diagnosis. For example, a child had to show both social aloofness and elaborate repetitive routines. The former symptom is usually only observed in the profoundly mentally retarded—children with IQs that tend to be below 35—and the latter seemingly requires substantial cognitive ability.\nAfter the DSM-III became available, clinicians started diagnosing more and more children with the condition: an autism diagnosis was a shiny new tool in the psychiatric arsenal. To qualify for a diagnosis, a child had to be judged as having all of six different criteria, including “Onset before 30 months of age”, “pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people”, “gross deficits in language development”, “if speech is present, peculiar speech patterns such as immediate and delayed echolalia, metaphorical language, pronominal reversal”, “bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment”, and “absence of delusions, hallucinations, loosening of associations, and incoherence as in schizophrenia.”\nThese criteria were replaced fourteen years later when the DSM-IV came out. With the new criteria, it became far easier to diagnose someone with autism. Now, instead of having to meet six high bars, one only had to meet six of sixteen lower bars. Instead of having to demonstrate a “pervasive lack of responsiveness to other people”, the clinician using the DSM-IV only had to note a “lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people”; instead of “gross deficits in language development”, children could merely show difficulty “sustain[ing] a conversation” or a “lack of varied spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play”. The clinician’s judgment of what’s “bizarre” was even replaced with the far more lax criteria of children showing a “persistent preoccupation with parts of objects”. What’s worse, some of the DSM-IV criteria were practically duplicates of one another, such as “failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level” and “lack of social or emotional reciprocity”, thus making it even easier to provide someone with an autism diagnosis.\nThe two diagnoses contained in the DSM-III(infantile autism and childhood onset pervasive developmental disorder) had also multiplied into five. The new diagnoses included the now-familiar Asperger’s and the less familiar Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, the latter of which first appeared in the 1987 DSM-III-R, and was defined by non-severe, subthreshold symptoms. The mild variants of autism introduced between the DSM-III and the DSM-IV quickly came to comprise the majority of autism diagnoses and continue to do so.\nNon-severe autism that was easier to get kids diagnosed paired with increasing efforts to identify kids as having autism. Around 2000, the practice of co-diagnosing autism with other conditions like Down’s, Tourette’s, intellectual disability, and cerebral palsy took root in the psychiatric profession. At the same time, widespread recognition that autism could exist at every level of intelligence also gained traction and efforts to identify the condition in younger children kicked off.\nAll of this happened in an environment that demanded the identification of ever more people with all sorts of disabilities. With the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Congress required schools to make special accommodations for disabled students. Two years later, Congress passed the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or “IDEA” from 1990 onwards), leading to the “Child Find” mandate, whereby schools were required to actively identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities, regardless of severity. With the Child Find mandate in place, each disabled child found led to additional funds for schools, incentivizing them to classify ever more children as having disabilities. 4\nGiven the known loosening of diagnostic criteria, the efforts to identify people who fit the new criteria, novel incentives to diagnose and over-diagnose, the advent of public awareness campaigns and consequently growing public awareness of autism and other disabilities, the question of “ If ” autism rates have really increased should be thought of as at least unsettled, and more likely the default hypothesis should be that changes in autism diagnosis rates reflect changes in diagnostics, laws, and culture rather than real growth in the prevalence of autism in our society.\n\nDid California Prove the Epidemic is Real?\nOne of the most prominent arguments that there is a “real” epidemic of autism comes from the a misinterpretation of data by the University of California Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (M.I.N.D.) Institute. 5\nIn 1999, the CDDS reported that autism had increased by almost 273% between 1987 and 1998. The scale of this increase was enough to throw California’s legislature into high alert and they commissioned M.I.N.D. to ascertain the causes of the increase. In 2002, M.I.N.D. reported there was “no evidence that a loosening in the diagnostic criteria has contributed to the increase number of autism clients served by [CDDS] Regional Centers”. The basis of this conclusion was M.I.N.D.’s reasoning that, since an autistic cohort born between 1983 and 1985 (initially diagnosed with the more restrictive DSM-III) and an autistic cohort born between 1993 and 1995 (initially diagnosed with the less restrictive DSM-IV) were both assessed with the DSM-IV and found to still be diagnosed as autistic, then the “observed increase in autism cases cannot be explained by a loosening in the criteria used to make the diagnosis”.\nIf that conclusion seems illogical given the procedure, that’s because it is. If it does not seem illogical to you, then I’ll borrow a well-known explanation of the issue to help you understand that it is.\n\nTo understand the fallacy of the conclusion, consider the following analogy, based on male height and graphically illustrated [below].\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nThis is an approximation of their figure. The distribution they showed seems to be more platykurtic.\n\nSuppose the criterion for “tall” was 74.5 in. and taller in the mid-1980s, but the criterion was loosened to 72 in. and taller in the mid-1990s. A diagnostic instrument based on the looser, more recent criterion of 72 in. would identify males who met the 74.5 in criterion. Although a perfectly reliable diagnostic instrument based on a looser criterion would identify 100% of the individuals who meet the looser criterion along with 100% of the individuals who meet the more restricted criterion, a highly reliable instrument might identify about 90% of each group; this is the percentage of each cohort in the California study who met the more recent autism criteria.\nMost crucially, broadening the criterion will result in a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases. For instance, census data allow us to estimate that 2,778 males in McClennan County, Texas would be called tall by the more restricted 74.5-in. criterion, and 10,360 males would be called tall by the broader 72-in. criterion; if these two criteria had been applied a decade apart, a 273% increase in the number of males called tall would have emerged—without any real increase in Texans’ height. In the same way, the 273% increase from 2,778 versus 10,360 California children who received services for “autism” in 1987 versus 1998 could well be a function of broadened criteria.\nWhat these authors argued for is no mere theoretical possibility. An empirical example where we know this happened comes from studies that have applied Kanner’s original criteria to more modern samples of autistic children. Children who qualified under Kanner’s criteria were also classified as autistic by the criteria in more recent versions of the DSM, but only about 40% of the children identified as autistic by DSM criteria met Kanner’s more stringent criteria for a diagnosis. Similarly, when autism diagnoses became somewhat more difficult to obtain with the release of the DSM-5, researchers observed that about a fifth of the children the CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network classified as autistic under DSM-IV-TR 6 criteria did not meet the DSM-5 ’s criteria for diagnosis. 7 Furthermore, the more severe a child’s DSM-IV-TR diagnosis in terms of the number of criteria they met, the more the two standards agreed. This finding also held up in Australia, where it seems that the introduction of the DSM-5 curbed the number of new diagnoses for a time 8.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nMaenner et al. 2014, Figure 1\nOther details of the California study directly suggest that rising rates were driven by broader diagnostic criteria, practices, or both. Namely, rates of intellectual impairment were thirty-four percentage points lower in the more recent cohort—61% earlier and 27% later, a difference equivalent to just over 0.89 d with equivalent population variances and normality in the distribution of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) levels—and on two out of three dimensions used for autism diagnosis, the later cohort was significantly less symptomatic than the earlier cohort. These findings indicate that the California study found a diagnosis of autism had come to represent something significantly less impactful for people’s lives in a short period of time, but they nevertheless concluded that diagnosis had not broadened. How? By saying that the difference was not “clinically significant”. To return to the height example from earlier:\n\nComparing two cohorts of males in McClennan County diagnosed according to our more restricted (74.5-in.) versus our broader (72-in.) criterion would probably result in a statistically significant difference between the two cohorts’ average height—but the difference would be just about an inch (i.e., most likely not a clinically significant difference).\n\nNovel Recording Exaggerates Increases\nLikely the second most prominent argument for a “real” autism epidemic is that the scale of the increase in autism diagnoses is so large it must be real. This belief does not follow from its premises, and frankly, a large increase is biologically implausible whereas a diagnostic change is something we know for a fact can cause major changes in diagnosis numbers. But I digress.\nOne of the most common sources for the claim of a massive short-term increase is the data schools collect to report to the Department of Education for IDEA compliance. To quote the Autism Society of America: “Figures from the most recent U.S. Department of Education’s 2002 Report to Congress on IDEA reveal that the number of students with autism in America’s schools jumped an alarming 1,354% in the eight-year period from the school year 1991-92 to 2000-01.”\nThat might be a lot, but not noted in that message: Autism wasn’t an IDEA report category before 1991-92, and in that year, it was entirely optional for school administrators to use. Every newly-introduced reporting category starts off similarly, being underused compared to the level it will be used at, and likely underused compared to the level it should be used at.\nMorton Gernsbacher has provided other examples of IDEA categories whose usage went up by a large amount for similar reasons as evidence for this proposition. As he noted, from 1991-92 to 2000-01, “traumatic brain injuries” grew by 5,059%, and by 2000-01, the category “developmental delay” had grown 663% from when it was introduced in 1997-98. These are effects that are not driven by any environmental cause or shift in genetics; there was no mass outbreak of people being smacked across the head that had coincidentally started in the year it became possible to report that sort of thing. These changes are just about increased use of a reporting category after it becomes available—a pure shift in reporting. This is common; Gernsbacher:\n\nAfter the initial year, the number of children reported under the IDEA category of autism has increased by approximately 23% annually. Why the continuing annual increase? As is the case with new options in the marketplace, like cellular phones and high-speed Internet, new reporting categories in the annual child count are not capitalized upon instantaneously; they require incrementally magnified awareness and augmentation or reallocation of resources.\nAs an example of this, note Massachusetts’ IDEA reporting and how it’s changed over time. From 1992 to 2001, they had the country’s lowest rate, at only about 0.4-0.5 per 1,000 children. But in 2002, the rate they reported went up by 400% in a single year as a result of the choice to start actually counting the number of students with disabilities rather than attempting to calculate their number from a ratio based on the proportion of students belonging to each disability category in 1992.\nMassachusetts was responsible and sensible and they did not claim that the massive one-year increase in autism reports meant autism had actually become far more common in a single year. Instead, they explained to Congress that the numbers would keep going up by large amounts for several years as “districts better understand how to submit their data at the student level” and “all districts comply completely with the new reporting methods.” This same sort of thing has happened all across the country.\n\nLines Going Up Together\nYet another prominent argument that there’s a “real” autism epidemic is that age-resolved snapshots of autism rates and constant-age tracking estimates substantially agree. 9\nAge-resolved snapshots are cross-sectional profiles of the prevalence of autism by age. Constant-age tracking estimates are time series prevalences for successive cohorts all measured at the same age. The idea is that if the slopes are the same, then the rise must be real, because the reference age used in the constant-age tracking estimates will be one that’s a good proxy for cumulative incidence. Age-resolved snapshots are intended to better isolate birth-cohort risk because they dampen period diagnostic noise, whereas constant-age tracking gives the “how many people of a certain age need services” answer, at least in theory.\nBut both slopes are affected by common forces. Consider it like this:\n\nIf P_{true} is actually constant, any systematic increase in the detection function will make both the age-resolved snapshot and the constant-age tracking series rise. There are many things that will affect both slopes, and likely to similar degrees.\nEarlier and more aggressive case-finding. This introduces lead-time bias and occurs because of factors like increasingly universal developmental screening, parent awareness campaigns, 10 routine M-CHAT checks at well-child visits, and so on. 11\n\nSnapshot: In one calendar year, younger children (born more recently) already carry larger fractions of their lifetime diagnoses, so the prevalence‑by‑age line tilts upward toward the younger ages.\n\nTracking: Each ADDM cycle observes eight‑year‑olds whose diagnostic “clock” started earlier, so the fraction identified by age 8 grows steadily over successive birth cohorts.\n\nEvidence: It’s recognized that measures “have been introduced to reduce the age at autism spectrum disorder diagnosis” not just in the U.S., but globally. Additionally, lowering the typical age at diagnosis further is frequently requested by researchers and advocates, for the sake of autistic children who might do better if they receive care at a younger age. Many researchers have recognized that this makes a contribution to autism rates. For births in California in 1990 versus 2001, for example, 12% of the rise in autism diagnosis rates was explicable by a falling age at diagnosis alone. In that same study, another 56% of the period’s rise was due to the inclusion of milder autism cases. Earlier age at diagnosis has also contributed\nBroader or looser diagnostic criteria. The DSM-IV folded Asperger disorder into the spectrum and the DSM-5 kept autism as a category but relaxed specifiers for language delay, co-occurrence, and IQ, making additional borderline cases eligible for diagnosis. Furthermore, school and insurance rules for diagnosis, check-ups, and so on often mirror DSM changes within a few years, providing means for a smooth increase in diagnoses with time, without a change in true prevalence.\n\nResult: Every cohort diagnosed under the newer rules—whether you view them at a specific age in tracking data or at any age in a snapshot—captures additional mild cases that would have been below threshold earlier.\n\nEvidence: The CDC’s ADDM data shows that the proportion of autism cases without intellectual disability has been climbing for decades, even including recent waves. Between 2000 and 2016, 84.6% of the increase in the ADDM was due to non-profound autism, with the remainder due to the profound variety. 12 Within both categories, diagnoses became less symptomatic; thus, autism in general has become less symptomatic. 13 This indicates criteria creep rather than an etiologic surge, as rising autism diagnoses with falling severity means some part of the diagnosis numbers going up reflects autism becoming a less alarming thing to be diagnosed with.\nImproved surveillance infrastructure. Electronic health records, state autism registries, and linkage with early‑intervention databases systematically capture cases that would have been missed two decades ago.\n\nThus, each new surveillance cycle benefits from better data feeds—boosting the constant-age estimate.\n\nWithin a single year, the platforms tend to have the most complete data on recent births (who have been in the record-linked systems since birth), nudging the snapshot upward for younger ages.\nDiagnostic substitution and category migration. Schools and clinicians may relabel children who would once have received “speech delay”, “learning disability”, or “intellectual disability” as autism because the label affords better services or clearer guidance. Parents have even been noted to push for their child carrying a diagnosis like “intellectually disabled” to be diagnosed with autism instead, because it provides additional funds and services.\n\nSubstitutions affects all ages in a given year, raising the snapshot, and accumulates across successive cohorts, raising the tracking estimate.\n\nEvidence: Special-education records reveal a decline in “mental retardation” and other diagnosis counts with each uptick in autism during the 1990s. This is observed in many areas, at many points in time. 14\nThe upward tracking slope comes from each successive cohort being subjected to earlier, broader, and arguably more complete ascertainment by a given age. The upward tilt in the snapshot comes from those same forces acting within the single surveillance year, giving younger children a head start on accumulating diagnoses.\nAcknowledging all this, the argument from similarity in slopes becomes fallacious and presumptuous. Additional evidence for this point comes from the way the results are presented. The slopes are allowed to differ radically—regularly by amounts like 20 to 40%!—and they’re still declared to be so similar as to support a “real” autism epidemic, when the difference indicates variability that’s so great it should cast doubt on any such inference.\n\nProfoundly Autistic or Profoundly… Something Else?\nA novel argument that autism has “really” increased is to be incredulous that researchers might have missed cases by modern criteria when they went out and sought cases with old criteria. This sounds absurd, but it was a view voiced in the recent autism press conference at the HHS. I’ll explain.\nBetween 1984 and 1985, researchers in North Dakota contacted “all relevant health and service providers” in the state and asked them “to provide names and records of all patients who had autistic symptoms”. The identified patients were between the ages of two and eighteen, and after getting in touch, they were provided with a comprehensive evaluation. During that evaluation, it was observed that twenty-one met DSM-III criteria for autism, two met the criteria for childhood onset pervasive developmental disorder (COPDD), and thirty-six were diagnosed with atypical pervasive developmental disorder. Thus, the prevalence for North Dakota was estimated at 1.16 per 10,000 for autism, 0.11 per 10,000 for COPDD, and 1.99 per 10,000 for APDD, for an overall pervasive developmental disorder rate of 3.26 per 10,000.\nThe way this study was understood by RFK Jr. was extremely differently from its reality. His remarks were as follows:\n\nIn 1987, it was another exhaustive study, a peer-reviewed study in North Dakota. Set out to county every child in the state with a pervasive developmental disorder including autism. That study meticulously combed through every record, every diagnosis, and even conducted in-person assessments of the entire population of 180,000 children under 18. The autism rate they found was 3.3 per 10,000. That’s in line with the 1 in 10,000 that was found in Wisconsin 17 years earlier.\nFor context, today the last number of 1 in 36 is 83 times higher. In 1987, out of every one million kids, 330 were diagnosed with autism. Today there are 27,777 for every million.\nIf you accept the epidemic denier’s narrative, you have to believe that researchers in North Dakota missed 98.8% of the children with autism. Thousands of profoundly disabled children were somehow invisible to doctors, teachers, parents, and even their own study. The same researchers who followed the original cohort for 12 years double-checked their number. They went back in 2000 and found that they had missed exactly one child.\nSo doctors and therapists in the past were not stupid. They weren’t missing all these cases. The epidemic is real.\nPractically every detail RFK Jr. provided during this section was incorrect or a misunderstanding. My suspicion is that someone on his team wrote these remarks for him and he believed what he was told. That person must have either been ignorant or severely biased, because they cannot have written this given what the study actually was. RFK Jr. should fire them for misleading him into spouting misinformation in an official statement of the HHS.\nFor one, the study was not as exhaustive as RFK Jr. was misled into believing it was. The researchers would have liked to detect every child in the state who had the conditions they were screening for, but they relied on recorded cases in the few years after the introduction of the DSM-III, before widespread recognition of autism. Moreover, the authors only contacted providers and asked them to refer patients to them for interviews, and there was no verification of the quality of those reports. Without the force of law behind them, there is no reason to suspect each provider would have provided all of their cases. Given the time the study took place, they certainly did not have adequate records, either, for financial and diagnostic reasons I’ve already gone into above. Contrary to what RFK Jr. was told, the researchers did not personally go out to do interviews with every child in the state either.\nFor two, the original study did not estimate the autism rate as 3.3 per 10,000. That’s what they estimated the overall pervasive developmental disorder rate at. This may seem to favor RFK Jr.’s point even more, but why this is relevant is unclear since the practices and funding for diagnosis and awareness of autism then differ radically from today.\nFor three, since we know their original estimate was an under-estimate, it’s not clear what value is supposed to be provided by mentioning the follow-ups. Well, maybe. The follow-ups do provide some value, but not for reasons stated by RFK Jr. In the follow-up, the researchers got in touch with just fifty-two of the original fifty-nine subjects. Ten declined to participate, leaving data for forty-two to work with. The researchers who did this follow-up did not, as RFK Jr. stated, find that they missed a child, because they did not do any novel discovery. The only time ‘just one child’ came up in the study, it was that one child had died between ascertainment and follow-up. The other forty-one whose data were revisited were found to generally show lower severity compared to their earlier assessment, with a 20% reduction using the criteria of the DSM-III-R, and a 23% reduction using the DSM-IV. Also: “Global Assessment of Functioning improved 19%, and the average number of comorbidities decreased 45%. Thirty-seven percent of patients improved in all four measures, whereas only 5% improved in only one measure.”\nWhat value this data might provide to RFK Jr. is that it might reinforce his case about how dramatic the incline in autism identification has been, because it naïvely seems likely that profound cases have increased even more dramatically given this baseline. But the reality is that severe cases were seriously underidentified, so it cannot really do that. We know this data is being misunderstood for many reasons.\n\nNorth Dakota still had asylums, and as the autism researcher and UCLA professor Edward Ritvo noted in his newsletter “No Epidemic of Autism”, these were important at the time. North Dakota had only just begun shutting down its asylums as it entered the 1980s, and the common practice then was to “warehouse” autistic people who had been “improperly diagnosed and housed.” This accounts for many of the most severe cases being missing from the sample and much of the rest of the country in this period.\n\nCo-diagnosis of autism and other disorders was not common until many years after the period 1984-85 in which the children were ascertained. If the children had a more severe disorder or—in many cases—even a less severe one that excludes an autism diagnosis, they would likely have been diagnosed with that alone rather than with infantile autism.\n\nThe age-range for the sample prohibits credible diagnosis for most cases. To be referred into the sample, the diagnosis had to have been logged before the researchers contacted the provider in 1984-85, and the DSM-III had only just come out in 1980. 15 Furthermore, the DSM-III criteria used required onset before thirty months of age, and the style of retrospective diagnosis required was and remains rare and impractical. Due to the diagnostic criteria in use in the study, most ages of child who could have theoretically been in the sample had to be seriously underdiagnosed.\n\nDakota is a state that is very White relative to the rest of the country, and the whole country used to be considerably more White than it is now. Recently, the increase in autism diagnoses has been greater for non-White persons. 16 This suggests underdiagnosis of non-Whites is something that used to be quite prominent, but more relevantly, it speaks to the need to demographically adjust future estimates to make them comparable to ones from the past. Even more importantly, it speaks to issues with the CDC ADDM’s—RFK Jr.’s primary reference—identification of the profoundly autistic. Non-Whites tend to have lower IQs than Whites, and a profound diagnosis can occur on the basis of an IQ score equal to or below 50 alone. 17 The increase in non-White diagnoses that likely stems from better service provisioning and reduced rates of neglect for diagnosis and other psychiatric services in their communities has thus elevated the rate of profound diagnoses without adaptive behavior deficits —profound diagnoses in name alone! The same thing has happened across class lines, as autism has gone from a wealthy family diagnosis to one that’s becoming more common in poor families. 18\n\nDiagnostic substitution has resulted in increases in the number of profound cases on the basis of intellectual disability and shifting people with serious non-autism disorders into being classified as autistic. It is not that profound cases were missed per se, it is that definitions have indisputably radically changed.\n\nPeople have started to lie to receive diagnoses. People seek out diagnoses, even as adults, in order to acquire greater levels of service for their children, and to receive additional welfare benefits for themselves. As the popularity of autism has increased via social media, more people have begun to self-diagnose 19 and to seek out professional diagnoses as well.\n\nThe 1-in-36 and 1-in-31 figures do not refer to severe cases, they refer to all cases, increasingly many of which are non-profound. 20 Talking about this change as if it represents an increase in profound autism alone that could not have possibly been missed, or as if symptom levels within the profound and non-profound categories haven’t fallen, or even talking about it as if it’s something that needs to be diagnosed for those affected to live a normal life is profoundly in error.\n\nThere’s So Much Evidence Favoring Diagnostic Change\nPolicy Change\nWe can be certain that autism rates have gone up for artefactual reasons—diagnosis, changing awareness and incentives, etc. rather than real increases in the number of people with autism— by exploiting policy changes. For example, above, I mentioned the Massachusetts saw autism reports increase 400% in one year due to a change in school reporting. Similarly, when states implement a policy of rewarding school districts for diagnoses, diagnoses immediately rise by about 25%. The underlying prevalence doesn’t shift, the incentives to diagnose do, simple as that.\nSomething similar happens when autism insurance mandates are put into effect. When insurers are legally compelled to provide treatments for children with autism, the number of people diagnosed with autism increases right away.\nOne study looked at mandates that affected children covered by UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Humana between 2008 and 2012. States that implemented the mandates initially had a diagnosis prevalence of 1.8 per 1,000, but after a year of the mandates, that crept up by 0.17, then by 0.27 in the second year, and by 0.29 in the third. The effect of a mandate in this period was a roughly 16% increase in the number diagnosed over trend.\nThis result was entirely predicted by the insurers and is a major reason why they attempted to prevent the mandates from being enacted. Supporting the arguments of insurers about run-away cost growth, a related finding is that when these mandates are placed on them, families shift from public to privately funded insurance and people shift towards using considerably more services, but the evidence on spending increases is not unambiguous, and the amount of the increase varies considerably by initial spending levels. 21 Age caps on mandates also help to limit spending.\nCorrelate Drift\nMeta-analytically, the meaning of autism has drifted in terms of the things it correlates with. As noted above, we know this is true for demographic correlates like race and class, and it’s becoming ever more true for sex as well. 22 But some correlates are more biologically proximal, and those too have drifted. For example, emotion recognition and theory of mind deficits? Down in more recent cohorts. Cognitive flexibility and planning problems? Diminished. P3b amplitudes and brain volumes? Not as exaggerated in autism any longer!\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nRødgaard et al. 2019, Figure 2\nAll of this means that autism is becoming less like what we might’ve once known autism to be. Where individuals with autism used to be more distinct from those without, they’re increasingly “normal”. Compare this to the situation with schizophrenia, which has a far more (keyword) pathognomonic presentation: time goes on and schizophrenia’s correlates are maintained.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nRødgaard et al. 2019, Figure 2\nSetting is Everything?\nAn under-discussed source of autism diagnoses is that providers are self-interested. Autism is a business, no matter how bad that sounds to say. The place providers do their diagnosing indexes characteristics of the providers and of the quality of the diagnosis, the cases, etc. as well. With that said, we know that, in some times and places, a large part of the increase in diagnoses can be chalked up to increased use of outpatient diagnosis. In this Danish example, about 40% of the increase in reported autism prevalence could be chalked up to the inclusion of outpatient contacts alone. A further third could be attributed to diagnostic change alone, and together, those factors explained about 60% of the increase. 23\nOne of the more influential settings affecting autism diagnoses is probably going to be proximity to autistic people. People learn socially, and many of them have learned about their own autism from the experience of encountering their autistic friends or seeing autism mentioned online. Many parents have learned that their kids might have autism from seeing their kids’ friends. A brilliant study using data from California provided perhaps the best evidence for this sort of effect.\nThese authors had access to California’s Birth Statistical Master Files and they used that data alongside the CDDS’ autism diagnosis data to track thousands of people who had autism and their siblings longitudinally, even through residential moves. With this data in hand, it becomes possible to test whether living physically near someone diagnosed with autism increases the odds of a child being themselves diagnosed. It does. The probability of being diagnosed significantly increases the closer a family is to another child diagnosed with autism. 24\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nLiu, King and Bearman, Fig. 2A\nAfter demonstrating this, the authors showed that this finding was not driven by underlying time trends, whereby, due to the rising prevalence of autism, “proximity to the nearest child with autism has increased over time simply because there are more children with autism.” They then ruled out population density by refitting the model with a median split, finding that the effect held up. This is pretty critical, since it suggests toxicant-based explanations have to affect both urban and rural areas. Their fixed-effects model also rules out non-time-varying toxicant sources.\nThe proximity effect on diagnosis also seems to be qualified by the type of autism. Namely, it leads to a larger increase in autism of the moderate-to-high functioning variety than of the low-functioning variety. The source of the referral for diagnosis also seems to be correlated based on proximity. Meaning, if the nearest child diagnosed with autism got referred by, say, a physician or hospital, then it’s more likely that the child now being referred was referred by the same source. With this in mind, the authors’ found suggestive evidence that the culprit—or savior?—could be school districts, as the effect only tended to show up when children were close but shared the same school district. Unfortunately, the samples that were close but in different districts were small, so that finding has to be viewed tentatively. But what doesn’t is the effect of moving.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging this data, we can compute a causally-informed estimate of the population-attributable fraction(PAF) of autism cases due to proximity effects. In this study, 40% of people were exposed in the sense of having an autistic child living within 500 meters of their home, and the effect was considerable, leading us to a PAF of 16%. In other words, 16% of autism cases can be attributed to living near other children with autism, for whatever set of reasons, from sharing a school district on down to living near the same hospitals or even an effect of cultural-geographic clustering. Additionally, bringing the quality of Medi-Cal coverage up—or lowering it down?—to the level of other insurance plans in this period would have increased diagnoses by another 13% due to the underdiagnosis effects of coverage for the poor or the overdiagnosis effects of other plans. The jury is out on how to interpret that effect.\nRepeat This Point\nEverything I’ve talked about so far is quite beside the point. A single piece of evidence indicates that there is no real epidemic of autism. As remarked in a review in a 2020 Nature Reviews Disease Primers article:\n\nNo significant evidence is available supporting that autism is rarer in older people, which provides further evidence against the suggestion that autism is increasing in prevalence over time.\nThe most major misconception in attempts to diagnose the causes and reality of the “autism epidemic” is this: that it’s much more common among kids than adults.\nIf you’ve read this far, you’ll no doubt have realized that the difference in diagnosis rates between children and adults stems from the former being exposed to a far greater level of novel identification criteria and practices, because autism is supposed to be diagnosed early. Active case-finding expeditions virtually all concern children and children alone, with adults given short shrift and, at best, being classified as autistic based on their rare opportunities to obtain a diagnosis earlier in life, or through self-selection.\nWhen researchers go out of their way to screen adults based on ICD-10/ DSM-IV criteria, they observe an autism rate of just over 1%. When the same methods are used by researchers who go out of their way to screen children, they observe an autism rate of just over 1%. If you were to use more or less expansive criteria, you would almost-certainly still find the same rates among the young and the old, albeit with a bias for very old ages due to survival deficits associated with autism and difficulties reliably reaching old people. 25 In truth, the concordance in rates across ages is a lucky coincidence of the expansion of autism, because it is extremely unlikely that many autistic individuals would survive to old age were they classified under Kanner’s criteria as opposed to the more modern, looser definitions in use today.\nSome of the most ‘slam-dunk’ evidence comes from places like Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Norway, which have population registers. These registers provide them with lots of information about people that could be used for understanding if there’s been diagnostic runaway without a similar increase in autism symptom levels. As it turns out, using Swedish data, we can see that there was no significant time-trend for measured symptom scores ( p= 0.85), but there was a highly-significant and highly-positive time trend for autism diagnoses ( p< 0.001).\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nDiagnoses are simply not a workable criteria for understanding prevalence without explicit and credible attempts to go out and find everyone who fits different diagnoses. The autism prevalence for Swedish kids based on symptom score measurements? A consistent 0.95% that didn’t significantly and systematically go up or down! But the diagnoses nevertheless just kept going, more than doubling between 1993 and 2002. But this doubling still wasn’t up to snuff, because the diagnosis numbers never actually met the known community prevalence of autism, and, as you now know, that prevalence drifts based on how strictly or loosely you define autism.\n\nSo remember this:\nThere is not, and has never been, any credible evidence for a “real” epidemic of autism or for any of its proposed environmental causes. Answering the question of if there is a “real” autism epidemic has provided a complete answer to the question of why there might be.\n\nNon-Causes and How To Avoid Them\nPeople have proposed tons of explanations for rising autism rates. These have almost all been careless attempts, since they have reasoned from the existence of a “real” epidemic, and thus about something to be explained in terms of increasing exposures. People have tried to argue for all sorts of out-there causes that imply we’re mismanaging our health systems, giving out drugs too willy-nilly, getting infected en masse and just generally being imbeciles about toxins in ways that are counter-indicated by real data.\nI’ve previously mentioned now-falsified examples of proposed causes like acetaminophen use during pregnancy, epidural use at birth, and infection during pregnancy. More recently, people have proposed ultrasound use during pregnancy as something to fear ( it’s not supported), and much more popularly, lots of people believe the rise in diagnoses—or, per them, the real rise in autism —is driven by vaccination.\nThe theory that autism is driven by vaccines makes no biological sense, fails to comport with the well-known extreme heritability of autism, and predicts nonsensical things given the expansion in diagnosis rates over time. For example, if vaccination has driven the expansions in rates, then it should have highly nonlinear effects: when vaccines are added to the childhood vaccination schedule, the overwhelming majority of people get them immediately, so why does the autism diagnosis rate keep climbing steadily? Without an accompanying rise in autism rates in the year vaccines are introduced, or in way that’s consistent with actual vaccine uptake, there’s no statistical plausibility to the autism-vaccine link. That there simply is no statistical link in large cohorts is therefore unsurprising. That there is definitely no causal link, as discerned with sibling studies, is doubly unsurprising.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nBut despite its origins in fraud, and its repeated, decisive refutations, the vaccine-autism link refuses to die in a large part of the public’s imagination. Some part of this is because people want it to be true. A not-insignificant number of parents even feel that there’s a lot of truth in it, because they’ve fallen for the old fallacy that, because something happened after something else, they must’ve isolated the cause.\nIn many cases, this happens because parents are looking for an explanation for why they just started to notice their child was autistic, and they’re happy to chalk it up to vaccines and well visits. People go so far in looking for support that they flat-out misread studies on the alleged harms of vaccination and they fall into theory rabbit holes, where the link is supported because they believe in some mechanism behind it. 26 Mercury content, thimerosal, and vaccination in general have all had mechanisms proposed to explain their association with autism, and they’ve all failed, probably because there’s no association between vaccination and autism in the first place.\nPlainly, if you want to avoid falling into the same traps, think causally and eschew consideration of “evidence” presented by people who cannot reason in terms of standard evidence like trials, large cohort studies, the rapidly expanding number of causal cross-sectional studies (i.e., DiDs, RDDs, IVs, etc.), and realistic animal evidence. 27 When a hypothesis is supported by conspiracy theorizing and cross-sectional associations that don’t replicate or can be seen to be due to confounding, then drop it and the person proposing them. 28 The person pushing the idea likely wants to convince you more than they want to be right, and you should let them know you know that by ignoring them. Demand good evidence, or you might find yourself fooled into thinking there’s been a “real” autism epidemic and it’s down to someone’s cause célèbre. 29\nActual Causes?\nThough no one has ever provided quality evidence for an environmental cause of autism, there may still be at least two things that could be causing slightly—but not massively—rising rates of autism. These are\n\nOlder parents. The age at first marriage and the age at first childbirth are increasing, and this seems to have a causal effect on children’s risk of autism. Could this be environmental, driven by the womb? Maybe, but since the paternal age effect is larger, it seems like the age-related accumulation of mutations in sperm will be more likely to take the blame. 30\n\nOur increasingly awesome healthcare systems. People who would never have survived childbirth or early childhood in previous generations are surviving nowadays at historically unprecedented rates. The examples range from those with major congenital defects to people with minor, but still risk-disposing issues, like autism. 31\nWe keep young people alive today better than we ever have, and that means that people who have historically been at-risk of an early death are being kept alive well beyond where they would have been historically. This might not mean much for the people who receive mild autism diagnoses, but it can mean a lot for those who receive profound diagnoses, since they are at the greatest risk of an early demise.\nI think that, though this increases the societal burden of the incapable to some degree, it is still to be lauded, because their lives still have value. The families broken up by having to raise these kids may be worse off, and there may be some calculus through which our medical advances are bad for society, but it’ll take a lot to move me from the position of valuing the lives of even the profoundly disabled. 32\n\nOpinionated Readings\nHere is where I voice my pleasurable agreement with RFK Jr.’s recent speech about autism. Near the end, he noted that the cost of medical care for autism are set to balloon over $1 trillion annually by 2035. This estimate seems credible and I take no issue with it. In fact, if a pro-diagnosis radical works their position into the next iteration of the DSM or the AMA succeeds in destroying prior authorization, the costs will probably be far greater.\nThis is why I have tried to avoid or qualify “under-” and “overdiagnosis” in addition to avoiding calling diagnostic change “good”. Change in diagnostic criteria and clinical practice can be “good” with respect to equating rates across age and demographic groups when diagnosis disparities are driven by bias, and it can be good for identifying people who genuinely need care. But we have to face this trio of facts:\n\nWe diagnose way too many people with autism that’s so mild it doesn’t need treatment.\n\nSo much spending on care for autistic people is wasteful. Someone with a mild case of Asperger’s does not need to hit a mandated spending cap for their condition, and someone with mental retardation whose caretakers convinced a clinician to give them a more favorable diagnosis should not be receiving treatment intended for autistics and found to be useless for the merely mentally retarded.\n\nWe have pathologized normal-range behavior. 33\nThe first two points speak for themselves. The latter is one that must be reiterated.\nSo many aspects of normal child—and particularly male —behavior have been turned into issues that demand psychiatric attention, and this has been done intentionally. I am actually awestruck by the fact that RFK Jr. has not fired the head of the Child Psychiatry Branch of the National Institutes of Mental Health, one Judith Rapoport, who was once quoted as saying:\n\nI'll call a kid a zebra if it will get him the educational services I think he needs.\nTo most people, admitting that you’ll lie to get someone diagnosed with a condition because you see a need should be a cause for alarm. Would you trust the psychiatrist telling you they’ll lie to get you services? Maybe, because you want those services, but would you like to pay for the same treatment for a million other kids? And if the next year, none of the kids deserve that treatment but they’re getting diagnosed anyway, do you want to foot the bill?\nThat the diagnostic situation has now evolved to the point where too many people are receiving services they do not need is now so well-evidenced that debate is hard to fathom and cutting the fat is more than warranted. I wish RFK Jr. all the luck in the world in these efforts, and if he wants a succinct, well-supported report on how to do the cuts without cutting care for the kids who really need it, he has my number.\n\nWe Must Get This Right\nWe have a moral duty to get this right. I know many of my readers departed from me a few paragraphs ago when I said I value the lives of the severely handicapped, and I expect more will stop reading right now, but what I’m going to write is heartfelt:\nI do not like knowing that autistic people are suffering for no reason.\nI recently noted an example of this over on Twitter. That example was chelation treatment. Plenty of people followed bad science and poor reasoning—likely in many cases desperately, and understandably—to the point where apparently about 7% of autistic people had been given a harmful, often painful, and—for autistics—difficult to endure treatment to remove heavy metals from their body in the hopes that it would treat their condition. This did not work. All it did was cost a lot of money, a lot of time, a lot of relationships between parents and autistic children, and it hurt people who often wouldn’t know anything about what was going on. 34\nIf bad science leads people to avoiding epidurals, a lot of mothers are going to needlessly suffer through birth. If bad science leads people to avoiding acetaminophen, a lot of people are going to live their lives with more pain than they would have otherwise. If bad science leads people to avoiding vaccines, a lot of kids are going to suffer, a lot of kids are going to die, and a lot of parents are going to wonder why they ever believed it was better to have a dead child than an autistic one.\nThere is no “autism epidemic” and there never was. There are no responsible toxins to remove from the food supply or chemicals to purge from the water or the air. If we cannot get this right, I doubt we’ll be able to do anything else any better.\n1\n\nMany adults who would unambiguously be classified as autistic today were classified as having different disorders in the past.\n2\n\nUsing the DSM-I and DSM-II, autistic children would likely have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics, if they could be diagnosed at all.\n3\n\n“Bias” in the sense that one cannot say that a diagnosed proportion in a given year is a better representation of the true rate of autism than the measurement in another year, only that the rates are better or worse representations of a certain definition of autism.\n4\n\nWith the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, Congress made clear that it was considering stepping in to change how funds were allocated because schools were excessively diagnosing completely normal children with disabilities to obtain federal funds. The 1997 changes included a mandate to report on race and ethnicity and additional monitoring and corrective action if states or districts showed signs of disproportionality, that is, if certain groups were being over-classified as disabled. In 2004, the reauthorization of IDEA came with a cap on federal funding growth and the formula was changed so funding was no longer tied directly to the number of students classified as disabled.\nNotably, the 2004 reauthorization included evidence that Congress actually engaged with the empirical evidence on the quality of disability classifications. For example, see their Footnote 137, wherein they rejected the dated notion that an “IQ-achievement discrepancy” reliably and consistently indicates educationally meaningful disability.\n5\n\nThe Credibility of M.I.N.D.\nFor the backstory on M.I.N.D. and the term “autism epidemic”, I cannot recommend Gernsbacher’s account more. It details, in brief, how M.I.N.D. stoked the errant belief in an epidemic of autism in a bid to receive additional funding and institutional support for themselves, and how this has damaged the NIH by pushing more of their relatively fixed pot of money towards researching an illusory epidemic of autism.\n6\n\nWhich was functionally the same for autism as the non-revised DSM-IV.\n7\n\nA review concluded that the average diagnosis reduction from DSM-IV to DSM-5 was one third for all diagnoses, and two thirds for milder forms.\n8\n\nThis study was also an extension of the findings like those reached by Maenner et al. As they noted in their literature review:\n\nA recent systematic review (Smith et al. 2015) and meta-analysis (Bennett and Goodall 2016) examined the sensitivity and specificity of the DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5, and the number of individuals diagnosed using these criteria. Across studies, a 35 and 37 % reduction in the proportion of individuals eligible for a DSM-5 diagnosis of ASD has been reported relative to the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, respectively (Bennett and Goodall 2016). Lower rates of diagnostic stability were evident for individuals with a previous diagnosis of PDD-NOS or Asperger’s disorder and/or an IQ over 70 (Bennett and Goodall 2016; Smith et al. 2015). Substantial variation was found across studies, with 38–93 % of individuals maintaining a diagnosis across criteria, reflecting differences in study sampling, methodology and the version of the DSM-5 (working or final) applied.\n9\n\nA related problematic means of claiming that the autism epidemic is “real” is to use inappropriate age-period-cohort models that are substantially driven by their assumptions. Researchers have noted this sensitivity, but I want to reiterate that the models used in the literature to make claims about a “real” epidemic are implausible in light of findings on changes in diagnostic criteria and practices.\n10\n\nAwareness campaigns also apply to clinicians. For example, knowledge of practices that increase rates of diagnosis, like conducting a 24-month screening after negative 18-month screening, spreads through people raising awareness in the professional community, and by practice administrators and non-psychiatric clinical staff promulgating policies.\n11\n\nBut cases are up among adults as well. Part of this adult increase is clearly self-interested and diagnoses are obtained in the purpose of additional welfare benefits.\n12\n\nThis statistic also overstates the relative portion of diagnoses that, with a certain diagnostic criteria, should be profound, because individuals with high cognitive ability are more likely to be missed.\n13\n\nEvidence for this same point comes from all over, but I want to highlight a study from Western Australia, since it had quite clear reporting. Its authors noted: “For children aged ≤5 years the incidence of ASD diagnosis increased significantly from 1992, with an average annual increase of 22%. Similar findings were found for autism. In the corresponding years the incidence of diagnosis of severe ID fell by 10% per annum and mild–moderate ID increased by 3% per annum.”\n14\n\nAnother study used a proxy method to support the notion of diagnostic substitution. They noted that the number of auxiliary health workers increased in lock-step with the number of autism diagnoses. A 100% increase in autism cases increased their wages over non-autism health occupations by 8-11%, and boosted the number of providers by 9-14%. They found that a third of new autism diagnoses were simply replacing mental retardation diagnoses, but argued that this wasn’t happening for other disorders.\nWhile this study is interesting and it was able to show evidence for diagnostic substitution, it suffers from some major flaws in reasoning. Namely, the authors seem to think that the residual of their substitution-driven increase was a real increase. They thought this because, they reasoned, auxiliary health providers cannot diagnose people, so they cannot induce demand. But this is a bizarre supposition. Just because you cannot directly diagnose, you cannot induce demand? Nurses induce demand for medication in states where they can’t access the prescription pad. I see no reason to think the same can’t be true here. Furthermore, the wages and labor supply of auxiliary health providers can increase for many more reasons than actual need for them. As an example where that happens, think of unions, or about how many people were needlessly hired into real estate offices before the Great Recession.\nRelated to this study, other works supports the idea that more providers are hired when more money flows towards autism. For example, Medicaid expansions lead to more hiring of child psychiatrists and board-certified behavioral analysts.\n15\n\nThe date of release for the DSM-III is also part of why we know the Wisconsin data RFK Jr. mentioned is irrelevant for reasons I’ve already explained.\n16\n\nPart of this likely reflects known difficulties diagnosing Blacks and Hispanics. Before accurate autism diagnoses, they are more likely to receive alternative, inaccurate diagnoses, and it takes them more visits to receive any diagnosis. For Hispanics, perhaps this is a cultural artefact and it’ll disappear after linguistic acculturation. But for Blacks? Perhaps psychiatric providers view them differently? Perhaps they’re more resistant to receiving certain diagnoses? It’s unclear to me why this bias exists, but it does, and my supposition is that the increased funding, awareness, and focus on minorities has reduced these diagnostic difficulties.\n17\n\nNote: Non-Whites tended to have higher rates of both autism in general and were more likely to have a severe variety in the latest ADDM report. The “Asian” category, it should be noted, refers to “Asian or Pacific Islander”.\n18\n\nA more recent iteration of IDEA than what I mentioned earlier implemented a multi-stage screening protocol that leads to greatly increased diagnosis rates that might have a particularly large impact on Hispanic households, because of their underrepresentation due to poor English skills.\n19\n\nAnd they are notably dissimilar from diagnosed autistic people.\n20\n\nThe judgment that profound cases are going up based on the CDC’s ADDM data is one that should be treated very cautiously because the relevant diagnostic factors (i.e., autism plus an IQ of 50 or less) are so often remedied with time. Cases classified as profound by the CDC tend to shift towards being non-profound with age due to the natural increase in cognitive ability as kids age up. Since the ADDM reports prevalences at ages four and eight, their surveillance leaves considerable room for cases categorized as profound on the basis of IQ scores to shift towards being non-profound.\nReports from the ADDM often seem to recognize this. In the most recent one, they wrote:\n\nFinally, the surveillance case definition of intellectual disability is not the same as a clinical diagnosis; IQ measurements in young children might lack stability and do not necessarily mean children have received a diagnosis of intellectual disability. Current diagnostic criteria for intellectual disability require documentation of adaptive behavior impairments, but adaptive assessments often are not present in children’s records.\nIt is also worth noting that the ADDM data necessarily reflect reporting biases because they are based on reporting done in different states using different diagnostic criteria, which lead to predictable variation in rates across state lines. The states also have access to different data to report up, and the sourcing of this data affects the rate of diagnoses. For example, California, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Utah, and Wisconsin provided IDEA Part C Early Intervention data, which, as Footnote 11 notes, come with elevated rates of diagnosis. Some data sources, like Medicaid, were purely administrative and lacked developmental evaluations.\nOr, in summation, there was variation in reporting sources, practices, and policies across states, and these predictably affect rates within ADDM sampling years, including the most recent one. This fact should be a lesson to those who cite the ADDM’s data as an indication of a “real” autism epidemic.\n21\n\nThough these mandates might appear to wastefully increase diagnoses, that might not be the case. They may genuinely help parents to get needed care that, when received, alleviates burdens on them. For example, there’s suggestive evidence that they reduce the need for parents to stop working. They may also crowd out sources of autism support.\n22\n\nFor an interesting read on sex and autism, see here.\n23\n\nAnother potentially relevant aspect of setting is country of residence. Several studies have noted that immigrants tend to have higher autism rates than in their countries of origin, and this difference is more dramatic if their country is poorer. To me, this reads as diagnostic resources being more available in richer countries, but there’s still the possibility it’s some sort of strange selection effect.\nAnother migrant-related finding to note is that, in Sweden, the children of migrant parents showcase a higher risk of being diagnosed with low-functioning autism, and this risk is higher for those whose parents come from countries with low HDI levels. Sweden has good screening for autism, free healthcare, etc., and I suspect the HDI association just reflects comorbidity with lower IQ, as in America with Blacks and Hispanics with autism being more likely to be classified as severely or profoundly autistic for IQ reasons despite not showing adaptive behavior deficits as often as comparably low-IQ White children diagnosed with autism.\n24\n\nInterestingly, distance also has a marginally-significant negative effect on sole diagnosis with mental retardation, indicating diagnostic substitution from that to autism. Perhaps parents of mentally retarded youths learn from nearby parents of children with an autism diagnosis that they can get additional services through seeking a diagnosis of autism. Or maybe when an official in the area diagnoses someone with autism, they’re more likely to do the same for others too. There are many possibilities to explain this potentiality, but it should also be noted that comorbid autism plus mental retardation significantly increases with proximity, so perhaps parents of mentally retarded children also seek out an autism diagnosis based on awareness or other proximity-related factors.\nThe authors also found that in this period, families with lower socioeconomic status got diagnosed considerably less often. This data is from the period in which wealthier parents were seeking out diagnoses more, and were more capable of getting them, so this makes sense.\n25\n\nThis was explicitly noted in this study of the prevalence in adults. Quote:\n\nOur CI for age is consistent with a percentage increase in prevalence of 4% or a percentage decrease of 6% per year of age. [i.e., a non-significant age effect] Small reductions of prevalence with age could be explained by increased mortality in autism or by older respondents being less available to participate in a household survey because of loss of family support or increased use of institutionalization. However, based on the literature reviewed earlier, we would expect substantially lower rates in earlier birth cohorts (older respondents) if rates of ASD have been rising considerably during recent decades, and we would also expect lower rates in younger adults than in recent childhood surveys using the ADOS-4. We did not find this. Overall, our findings suggest that prevalence is neither rising nor falling significantly.\nThis favors the interpretation that methods of ascertainment have changed in more recent surveys of children compared with the earliest surveys in which the rates reported were considerably lower. Our data suggest that the causes of autism appear to be temporally constant and that recent apparent rises in rates of diagnosis must therefore reflect better survey case finding rather than some new environmental toxin.\nComparable diagnosis rates are obtained even using similar population-general criteria in an environment where children should be expected to receive more diagnoses, such as in the NHS’ Mental Health of Children and Young People in England(1.2%) and the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey(0.8%, values not significantly different). By 2010, administrative diagnosis rates had not yet reached this community prevalence. The issues with administrative underestimation relative to community prevalence are well-known and appreciated in the U.K., and researchers there treat the administrative prevalences—appropriately— as underestimates contaminated by age-related bias. But, reassuringly for those who are interested in making administrative and community prevalences agree, rates of diagnosis have been increasing faster there for adults.\nIt is also worth noting that the Global Burden of Disease study, which aims to account for methodological differences between different estimate sources, has not pointed to any increase in autism prevalence. Their U.S. estimate in 1990 was a prevalence of 1.05%, and in 2021, it was 1.03%—no real difference. The 2019 GBD study also had a 2024 publication on it that illustrates the lack of difference in predicted autism diagnoses between the ages of 5 and 24 as well.\n26\n\nBut mechanisms are not and cannot be evidence. Just because something is supposed to work some way to explain some thing does not make it so, and nutrition science is littered with zombie theories where a mechanism failed to deliver, but people persist anyway.\n27\n\nNot to be confused with animal evidence like what supported recent dye ban proposals, where rats are injected with nontrivial portions of their own bodyweight in dye and they’re found to suffer for it.\nConsider this a second 27th footnote: If you want to see a lot more causal studies on exposures and autism, then encourage governments to open up archival datasets and to collect more data so that large-sample sibling studies for every little exposure can be performed at a moment’s notice.\n28\n\nIf you’ve gotten this far, you will now realize that poor diagnosis, limited awareness, and avoidance of modern psychiatric practice explain many of the ‘odd’ observations that “real” epidemic promoters cite, like allegedly low Amish rates of autism. The alternative explanations based on vaccine (most Amish are vaccinated) and toxin exposure are little more than throwing darts at a wall, and in some forms better characterized as conspiracy theorizing.\n29\n\nThe alleged link between vaccines and autism was recently widely mocked on Twitter by people plotting associations that were often even more strongly but obviously spuriously linked to autism. Click through the quote tweets on this to see many examples.\n30\n\nAssortative mating is also a possible and potentially related reason for the rise.\n31\n\nThis meta-analysis is somewhat irksome because it attempts to attribute autism to the difficulties observed in childbirth rather than the difficulties to autism. Given the sibling-controlled evidence on the autism-epidural association, we can be reasonably certain that the association goes from autism to birth difficulties that lead women to prefer strong pain control. This readily makes intuitive sense, as autism is also associated with things like, say, having a very large head.\n32\n\nThis is decidedly not a stance against embryo selection, gene editing, and so on to prevent the births of people with profound autism. Companies like Orchid are providing immense value for humanity and the future, and they should be lauded for making the future better and, in a respect, trivializing some of the medical advances that let us perform wonders like keeping the severely at-risk from dying early. I just value life a lot, even though I would prefer if everyone lived a better life, free from congenital or acquired disease.\n33\n\nIf I had to add a fourth fact, it would be that there are unacceptably many people who are gaming the system for their personal benefit. They get expanded normal care, they get more time to take the SAT, they get a boost to their grades, etc., and all of that is worth combatting.\n34\n\nThere’s a similar story to tell about many other kook- and crank-driven treatments, like giving autistic people secretin.",

If you&#8217;re looking to acquire Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Retatrutide or other GLP-1RA drugs at an extremely low price of around $15-$40 per month, see <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/how-to-get-cheap-ozempic\">this article</a>.</em></p><div><hr></div><p>There&#8217;s a loud minority online that hates the idea of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs (GLP-1RAs) like Ozempic and Tirzepatide. They don&#8217;t like that they allow people to &#8216;cheat&#8217; their way to weight loss, that the drugs make it &#8216;too easy&#8217; to lose weight. The ideas that people can inject a simple fix to their problems or that a drug can be unambiguously good just doesn&#8217;t sit well with them, so they invent and latch on to bad reasons to dislike GLP-1RAs. They make claims like:</p><ul><li><p>GLP-1RAs don&#8217;t work because you have to keep on them, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-worst-argument-against-ozempic\">just like how you have to keep exercising and dieting to maintain weight loss normally</a>.</p></li><li><p>GLP-1RAs cause thyroid cancer, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1901434539588649348\">even though that association doesn&#8217;t seem to be supported</a>.</p></li><li><p>GLP-1RAs are making people blind on a staggering scale, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1917703456921641115\">even though that&#8217;s implausible and seemingly untrue</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Not one of the numerous alleged, major downsides of GLP-1RAs has held up to scrutiny so far, and it&#8217;s not clear why they would when the trial results so clearly show tolerability, that the drugs have been in use for long enough and with enough prescriptions for major downsides to be apparent, and that the mechanisms behind the drug are so benign and commonplace. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1897502827448033553\">The mechanism in question is neural GLP-1 agonism</a>, and we know that operations that create relatively high levels of endogenous GLP-1 production&#8212;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-017-2913-1\">like Roux-En-Y gastric bypass</a>&#8212;are safe, meaning that there&#8217;s a large amount of excellent, long-term data to reassure us that GLP-1RAs should be too.</p><p>One popular argument against GLP-1RAs is that they lead to excessively high muscle mass loss compared to standard, non-pharmacological weight loss. Some people have even taken this so far as to claim that GLP-1RAs lead to more muscle than fat loss. Both points are difficult to credibly support, but there is at least <em>something </em>intuitively sensible about the first claim even if a pharmacological mechanism is absent. A pretty apparent fact is that the people who use GLP-1RAs tend to be lazier: they tend to exercise less and eat worse than people losing weight the traditional, non-drug assisted way. That could have predictable consequences for the ratio of muscle to fat loss, or so the logic goes.</p><p>Whether the logic actually holds is another matter.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #1: Do People Lose More Muscle Than Fat?</h3><p>The claim here is that people cut weight with GLP-1RAs primarily by losing muscle rather than fat, thus worsening body composition after drug-assisted weight loss. This position is not supported empirically. In each trial, the opposite is true: people lose more fat than muscle, improving their body composition as they lose weight.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183\">a major trial of Semaglutide</a>, the treatment group lost an average of 8.36 kilograms of fat and 5.26 kilograms of lean body mass. The placebo group lost an average of 1.37 kilograms of fat and 1.83 kilograms of lean body mass. The relative contributions of fat to weight loss were 61.4% for the GLP-1RA group and 42.8% for the group losing weight with a placebo.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">a major trial of Tirzepatide</a>, the treatment group lost 33.9% of their total fat mass and 10.9% of their lean mass, versus 8.2% and 2.6% for the placebo group. Both outcomes were favorable, but the treated participants fared better: &#8220;The ratio of total fat mass to total lean mass decreased more with tirzepatide (from 0.93 at baseline to 0.70 at week 72) than with placebo (from 0.95 to 0.88).&#8221; Similarly, in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.23939\">a relatively short trial of Retatrutide</a> (Poster-474), participants saw considerable weight loss which was two-thirds fat and one-third lean.</p><p><a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932\">Similar</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2824%2900272-9/abstract\">ratios are</a> <a href=\"https://www.easd.org/media-centre/home.html#!resources/tirzepatide-achieves-significant-weight-loss-without-adverse-effects-on-muscle-composition-surpass-3-mri-d33f2a13-d83e-4112-8763-621e82d3e128\">observed in</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-019-05065-8\">different</a> <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/12/2414\">trials</a> and these results are <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728\">entirely typical across the literature</a>. The only net unfavorable compositional result came from <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01158.x\">a trial of a less effective, daily-dosed older generation of GLP-1RA drug</a>, Liraglutide. That failure was a narrow one (60% lean mass loss) in a very low-power substudy which also produced the nonsensical result&#8212;which failed to replicate&#8212;that a higher dose led to less weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #2: Is the Muscle Loss Ratio Unusually High?</h3><p>The claim here is that GLP-1RAs cause more muscle loss than would be expected given the same amount of weight loss done without pharmacological assistance, such as through using diet, exercise, or bariatric surgery. A simple way to answer this is to plot body weight loss versus lean body mass loss across different intervention regimes conducted on similar populations. That was recently done in <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728\">a paper in the journal </a><em><a

diet, GLP-1RAs, and bariatric surgery produce clinically comparable and statistically indistinguishable reductions in lean body mass. This fact has been pointed out in GLP-1RA trials; <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">for example</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Participants treated with tirzepatide had a percent reduction in fat mass approximately three times greater than the reduction in lean mass, resulting in an overall improvement in body composition. <strong>The ratio of fat-mass loss to lean-mass loss was similar to that reported with <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21577\">lifestyle-based and surgical treatments for obesity</a>.</strong></p></blockquote><p>But this does not actually answer the claim because it&#8217;s about <em>muscle loss</em>. Lean mass measurements are a great proxy for muscle, but lean mass is not just muscle, as it also includes water, bone, and other tissues, in addition to fat infiltration.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> There is, however, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00027-0/fulltext\">one brand-new study</a> that does provide an answer using MRI-based measurements from the SURPASS-3 trial of Tirzepatide and from the U.K. Biobank.</p><p>The study looked at individuals in the large and popular U.K. Biobank cohort and assessed the relationship between non-pharmacological weight loss and muscle loss so that &#8216;normal&#8217; weight loss could be compared to the weight loss in a matched cohort that lost weight using GLP-1RAs.

To get to that answer, the amount of muscular volume lost at a given amount of weight loss has to be compared directly. The answer from that analysis was favorable: those on Tirzepatide lost 0.04 liters more muscular volume at the same level of weight loss, which is both clinically unimportant and was statistically nonsignificant (<em>p</em> = 0.22).</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #3: Do GLP-1RAs Produce Muscular Dysfunction?</h3><p>We now know that GLP-1RAs produce more fat loss than muscle loss and that the muscle loss from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is comparable to the muscle loss that comes with lifestyle-based weight loss and from surgery. But now we have to ask: do GLP-1RAs make people unusually weak? It&#8217;s one thing to maintain muscular volume, but it may be quite another to maintain muscular quality.</p><p>There are considerable reasons to disbelieve the claim that muscular dysfunction follows from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss. The evidence above indicated that muscular volume is maintained, and that alone is <em>very strong</em> evidence that this belief is unfounded, but it is not itself dispositive. In the comparison between Tirzepatide-based weight loss and weight loss in the U.K. Biobank, additional evidence came in the form of observations about <em>fat infiltration</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\" title=\"Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Aldona Griskeviciene/Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure></div><p>Fat infiltration, or myosteatosis, refers to the condition where fat gets in and between muscle fibers. This happens to everyone to varying extents, and it&#8217;s particularly marked with age. Moreover, it is <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-023-02641-5\">strongly related</a> to reduced strength, and increases in it seem to cause frailty and physical weakness. More importantly, reductions are accompanied by improved physical functioning. There&#8217;s high-quality documentation of this fact based on <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/3/711/5289722\">individuals who have received Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses</a>. Their operation did cause weight loss (-30%), did cause fat loss (-48%), and did cause both lean mass loss (-13%) and reductions in absolute strength (-9%). However, relative strength increased by a much more substantial margin (+32%), and this improvement came with significant improvements in physical performance measures, like improved walking speed and heightened physical activity levels.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>This is what is expected with <em>any </em>intentional weight loss efforts aimed at improving body composition and weight level. That should not come as a surprise since fat genuinely impedes muscular function. Relatedly, in individuals experiencing disease-related wasting and <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/hep/fulltext/2023/10001/the_liver_meeting__boston,_massachusetts_nov.1.aspx#JCL2194\">among those with metabolic disorders</a>, fat infiltration tends to <em>increase </em>as weight declines, suggesting our eyes aren&#8217;t playing tricks on us and that those individuals are experiencing unhealthy weight loss.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the kicker: fat infiltration falls with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss, as it does with non-pharmacological weight loss. This finding holds both compared to a control drug (shown below) and compared to the weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample (-0.42pp, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001).<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> Therefore, we should have it as our prior that this sort of weight loss is not unlikely to <em>improve </em>rather than <em>degrade </em>muscular function, given everything else we know.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\"

by noting, for example, that <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932\">there is no apparent excess reduction in metabolism after taking GLP-1RAs</a>, indicating that the weight loss is metabolically healthful. Or, to take things to their logical conclusion, we could simply look at what participants in trials report about their physical functioning. That means <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">reporting significantly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183\">fewer physical limitations</a> in daily life and <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15620\">otherwise improved physical functioning and even quality of life</a>.</p><p>One could reasonably say that participants are overhyping the benefits to quality of life or physical functioning, but given all the other evidence, that argument rests on unsolid ground and it would be more reasonable to claim that the changes are real and correctly being observed by patients. This is even more strongly supported by observations regarding health, like those based on the reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in lung function, and even based on reported social improvements. Social improvements, I feel, should be viewed as indications of health improvements, since if people are socializing more, are going out more, and are off their couch in general, they&#8217;re probably doing other things that are more healthful and which were more difficult when they were fatter.</p><p>All lines of evidence point to GLP-1RAs <em>improving </em>rather than worsening muscle quality and physical functioning. Though there is reason to be concerned about individuals who are at-risk for sarcopenia using the drugs when they should not, that is not an indictment of GLP-1RAs in general use or mechanistically.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> It is, instead, a point of caution doctors should keep in mind when making the choice to prescribe these drugs.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Strong Priors: Weight Loss is Therapeutic</h3><p>On the basis of the existing evidence, we can confidently state this: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to be unique except in as much as GLP-1RA users are self-selected. With this statement of the evidence in mind, the weight loss that people are undergoing using GLP-1RAs should be regarded as health-promoting as much as weight loss in general is.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>Concerns about <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.067676\">induced frailty</a> and so many other alleged side effects of GLP-1RAs run counter to the evidence and routinely lack any semblance of biological plausibility or any sort of statistical credibility. If I had to bet, that will remain true and scientifically unsupported concerns will continue to dominate the GLP-1 debate.</p><div><hr></div><h3>June 18th 2025 Update: The COURAGE and EMBRAZE Trials</h3><p>Several companies are developing products to reduce the amount of lean mass loss that occurs during GLP1-RA-induced weight loss. While this effort does not seem justified based on the existence of excess GLP-1-RA-related lean mass loss, it&#8217;s still justified for the reason that it&#8217;s generally good to lose less lean mass. Furthermore, if people fear excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RAs, regardless of that fear&#8217;s reality, a company might be able to profitably sell something to address that concern, which could be good for its bottom line. It&#8217;s hard to blame companies for exploiting this fear.</p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250607183759/https://newsroom.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/interim-results-ongoing-phase-2-courage-trial-confirm-potential\">Regeneron</a> (COURAGE) and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250618221625/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250618254394/en/Scholar-Rock-Reports-Positive-Phase-2-EMBRAZE-Trial-Results-Demonstrating-Statistically-Significant-Preservation-of-Lean-Mass-with-Apitegromab-During-Tirzepatide-Induced-Weight-Loss\">Scholar Rock</a> (EMBRAZE) recently released preliminary phase II trial results showing the success of their myostatin inhibition-based approaches.

These loss ratios seem to be fine and at a level where weight loss is certainly healthful, especially for individuals suffering from serious obesity. With that said, semaglutide may be statistically&#8212;but not typically clinically&#8212;worse than tirzepatide across the published literature, and perhaps low-dose myostatin inhibitors could make both superior to most other weight loss approaches, if not in terms of the total lean mass loss ratio itself, then in terms of that <em>in combination</em> with the feasibility of treatment.</p><p>Though I did not illustrate it, Regeneron&#8217;s high-dose trevogrumab and garetosmab therapy was superior in terms of lean mass loss to almost everything on this chart and it was superior to everything on this chart feasibility- and absolute loss in a given amount of time-wise, but garetosmab tolerability left something to be desired.</p><p>The results of the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials are encouraging regardless of the validity or lack thereof of worries over excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3>June 21st 2025 Update: A Systematic Review of GLP-1RAs</h3><p>There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002604952400341X\">a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on GLP-1RA effects on body composition</a> and its results are worth mentioning.</p><p>Across twenty-two randomized controlled trials of varying lengths, drugs, and dosages, GLP-1RAs were associated with 3.55 kilograms of lost weight, 2.95 kilograms of lost fat mass, and 0.86 kilograms of lost lean mass. You might notice that 2.95 + 0.86 = 3.81, not 3.55, so something is amiss. You&#8217;d be right: all the estimates aren&#8217;t matched; not every study reported each outcome, so there&#8217;s a bit of noisiness. But, using these numbers, we can get a plausible range of values for the lean mass percentage. If we use the fat mass loss as a percentage of the overall body weight loss, GLP-1RAs are associated with 16.9% lean mass loss, and if we use the lean mass loss, the number is 24.2%, and if we reason from the sum of the lean and fat mass loss numbers, the lean percentage is 22.6%. Per the authors, lean mass loss generally comprised &#8220;approximately 25% of the total weight loss&#8221;, consistent with the Quarter FFM Rule.</p><p>If we look specifically at the results for top-line GLP-1RAs in use today, we see that they had reports on 15 mg weekly tirzepatide, 1 mg weekly semaglutide, and 14 mg daily oral semaglutide, in addition to reported on liraglutide given at dosages of 1.8 or 3.0 mg. Comparing the lean mass percentages for these different drugs is possible, and I&#8217;ve added a chart of this in this footnote<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, but I want to advise that I don&#8217;t think simply comparing fat loss percentages without contextualization is the right approach. The reason is, different trials led to different total weight loss, and total weight loss moderates the extent of lean mass loss. If you lose enough weight, you will eventually lose both more and a higher percentage of lean mass. It&#8217;s unclear if this happens in the range seen in these studies. Indeed, one could easily argue the opposite, but for low amounts of lost weight, because the first weight to go is lean mass in the form of water weight. So, we&#8217;ll isolate our view to the endpoints of trials with significant and positive weight loss.</p><p>As with the overall results, there is some imprecision due to unmatched estimates, so keep that in mind. Tirzepatide (15 mg/week) led to 10.81 kilograms of lost weight, of which 8.75 were fat and 1.84 were lean. Taking the lean percentage from the sum, we get 17.4%, or from the total based on fat mass lost, we get 19.1% versus 17.0% reasoning from fat and lean mass losses, respectively. For semaglutide (1mg/week), there were 6.24 kilograms of total weight lost, of which 4.37 were fat and 1.22 were lean. The same numbers were 16.4%, 30%, and 19.6%. For oral semaglutide, total losses were 2.60 kilograms, with 2 kilograms of fat and 0.60 lean, for 23.1% lean mass losses.</p><p>If we take all the aggregated treatment effects with weight loss in this review, we can assess the slopes for fat and lean mass loss versus total weight lost straightforwardly. By contrasting these slopes, we can gather an expectation about lean mass loss as weight loss grows.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\"

tirzepatide datapoint or the estimates with nonsignificant total losses. Even removing all of them doesn&#8217;t really change the picture. The authors of the paper used the individual study point estimates when they did a meta-regression similar to this, and they found slopes of &#946; = 0.7 and 0.09 for fat and lean mass loss, respectively. Their estimates were even more favorable towards GLP-1RAs than the estimates I made from the aggregated numbers. In both cases, linearity seemed tenable enough.</p><p>This review provided substantial and clear evidence: <em>GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to produce meaningfully different compositional effects than typical weight loss, as represented by the Quarter FFM Rule.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>June 23rd Update: The Age of Mass-Market Monoclonals?</h3><p>Today, Eli Lilly gave an incredible presentation at the ADA 2025 meeting. They showed the results of treating people with their activin type-II receptor inhibitor, bimagrumab, without and without the addition of semaglutide.

Let&#8217;s go left-to-right:</p><ul><li><p>Bimagrumab on its own led to weight reductions, as seen in <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774903\">an earlier phase II trial</a>.</p><ul><li><p>These reductions were entirely due to the loss of fat.</p></li><li><p>Meaning, muscle was entirely preserved in bimagrumab-only treatment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Semaglutide alone led to a proportion of fat loss not distinguishable from the Quarter FFM Rule. It did not lead to excess lean mass loss.</p></li><li><p>Combination bimagrumab and semaglutide led to compositional improvements.</p><ul><li><p>Proportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in typical weight loss.</p></li><li><p>Proportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in weight loss with good control over exercise and diet.</p></li><li><p>The pace of weight loss was accelerated over semaglutide-based expectations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The dosage of bimagrumab (10mg/kg in low-dose arms or 30mg/kg in high-dose arms) was unrelated to the extent of lean mass preservation, only to weight loss.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a></p><ul><li><p>This fits with, but, at this dosage, fails to confirm the theory that much lower dosages could still deliver substantially improved lean mass preservation.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Reassuringly, bimagrumab did not seem to produce &#8216;useless&#8217; muscle, as it was at least strength-preserving, and potentially strength-enhancing.</p><ul><li><p>Physical function was improved.</p></li><li><p>Grip strength was sustained or improved.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Leptin levels fell by more and adiponectin levels increased by more among the bimagrumab users.</p></li><li><p>Proxied inflammation levels fell more with bimagrumab than with semaglutide alone.</p></li></ul><p>Now, onto the bad parts.</p><p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a statistical caveat here: Eli Lilly primarily presented TOT instead of ITT estimates. These are more favorable to efficacy judgments and they make comparisons with other plots in different studies more difficult. Moreover, the difference may be particularly meaningful in this case, because high-dose monoclonal antibody treatments often come with a lot of side effects. This was no exception, although it should be noted that none of the side effects were &#8220;serious&#8221;, meaning becoming life-threatening.</p><p>The side effects that were above and beyond the typical side effects seen with semaglutide were:</p><ul><li><p>Muscle spasms (~50-75% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~6% for placebo and ~9-13% for semaglutide)</p></li><li><p>Acne (~34-55% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~4% for placebo and 9-11% for semaglutide)</p></li><li><p>Lipid profiles showed an atherogenic shift.</p><ul><li><p>HDL levels decreased transiently in all weight loss groups, but they decreased more for bimagrumab users, and they only returned to baseline by 48 weeks for them, whereas they returned to baseline by 24 weeks for semaglutide users.</p><ul><li><p>For all treatment groups, HDL levels increased above baseline to a comparable degree after the trial was through, so this is not an ongoing concern.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>LDL levels experienced a sustained roughly 10% decline for the semaglutide-only groups, but they experienced a sizable increase for the bimagrumab groups, ranging between 15% for the highest-dose group to 30% for the high-dose bimagrumab-alone group.</p><ul><li><p>The levels in the high-dose groups that took semaglutide moved back to baseline by 24 weeks after treatment.</p></li><li><p>Levels for the high-dose bimagrumab-only group dropped down to +18% by 24 weeks after treatment, and in both of the bimagrumab groups using low-dose semaglutide, they seemed to not move at all post-treatment, sticking around at ~13-16% above baseline.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>All the caveats noted, this antibody treatment clearly has major potential and possible mass market appeal.</p><p>Acne is generally mild and manageable, and muscle spasms are also generally mild, and they&#8217;re usually transient. Both are also side effects seen with anabolic steroid usage, and you can just ask bodybuilders how they deal with those issues: <em>they&#8217;ll usually say they&#8217;re fine, manageable, and worthwhile. </em>(Imagine how much this will help bodybuilders with cut and bulk cycles!) Since steroid users tend to be younger and hardier, they might not even care about the muscle spasms at all, but these could be a bigger issue for the general population and especially for the elderly. The lipid issue is also something seen with anabolic steroid usage, and it is also manageable, but definitely more pesky. The atherogenic effect of LDL accumulates with time, so therapy with bimagrumab might benefit from statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or simply not going on for a very long time. Bimagrumab definitely benefits from being paired with semaglutide to control the atherogenic risk, and it may also benefit if there are bimagrumab-related <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.11.659035v1\">glycemic control issues</a> down the line. This atherogenic issue might present an issue for the people who want to use bimagrumab to <em>gain </em>muscle, but they are neither here nor there. If there are other side effects like alopecia, those have not come up to my knowledge, and they will need to be investigated. That sort of thing may be a phase IV issue.</p><p>In the study&#8217;s high-dose bimagrumab and semaglutide arm, 94% of participants achieved at least a 30% reduction in fat mass, so given you can very likely just come off to get rid of the acne and muscle spasm side effects while sustaining your weight well due to the preserved muscle mass, a huge number of customers will find this to be worthwhile. When this moves to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-022-01189-0\">a subcutaneous dosage factor</a> and the price drops, I am certain we&#8217;ll see lots of people clamoring to use this product and products like it. Eli Lilly is also running a trial with tirzepatide instead of semaglutide; it&#8217;s likely that trial will see even smaller reductions in lean mass and even greater weight loss, with <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1936128617463136529\">fewer gastrointestinal side effects</a>.</p><p>Best of luck to Eli Lilly and to every other pharmaceutical company trying to make this a reality. What they&#8217;re doing here is nothing short of amazing. They are making weight loss an injectable, and making being&#8212;in terms of being muscular and low-fat&#8212;increasingly trivial. If companies like Eli Lilly, Regeneron, and Scholar Rock succeed, then Americans will become much more attractive, athletic, and healthy, fast.</p><p>I hope to see more work done in this area to alleviate the issue of lean mass loss with weight loss, even though this study and studies like it show that it&#8217;s not a problem that&#8217;s unique to or accentuated in GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>Will I Keep Updating This Post?</em></h3><p>There will be no more large edits unless something big happens. The evidence is clear enough and anyone still in denial about the fact that GLP-1RAs do not lend themselves to excess lean mass loss is fighting an uphill battle against mountains of evidence.</p><p>I will likely only be doing small edits below, largely by bullet point, as new results come along. I also may go back and edit the parts on Regeneron&#8217;s, Scholar Rock&#8217;s, and Eli Lilly&#8217;s results once the papers are published for the preliminary trial results I covered.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Short Updates</h3><ul><li><p><strong>June 24, 2025: </strong>A subscriber sent me <a href=\"https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/47/10/1718/154535/Incretin-Based-Weight-Loss-Pharmacotherapy-Can\">Locatelli et al.&#8217;s</a> article arguing that adding exercise to incretin-based therapies would help to reduce the extent of lean mass loss.<br><br>The data they cite overlaps considerably with what I cite here, so not much new on that front. The conclusions they reach are about benefits from exercise also valid, and if you scroll up to the weight loss method vs. compositional change chart I made, you can see evidence for it. As public health advice, their conclusions are not very useful, because <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/148945836/june-th-update-real-world-rebound-evidence\">motivating people is a major part of the issue with weight in the first place</a>. But there might be utility in telling people that exercise can offset lean mass loss, or that the lean mass loss ratio is broadly similar between GLP-1RA therapy and other forms of weight loss.</p></li></ul><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The most common means of measuring lean body mass is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA. When DXA is used, it &#8220;sees&#8221;:</p><ul><li><p>Bone mineral (minerals in bone)</p></li><li><p>Fat mass (soft-tissue pixels whose X-ray attenuation matches adipose tissue, like subcutaneous, visceral, or large seams of inter- and intra-muscular fat large enough to dominate a pixel)</p></li><li><p>Lean soft-tissue mass (everything else, including water, muscle fibers, organs, connective tissue, plus any fat or fibrous tissue interspersed within muscle but too fine-grained for DXA to resolve)</p></li></ul><p>DXA classifies each 1-5mm pixel into one of these categories based on the ratio of low- and high-energy X-ray attenuation. If a pixel contains mostly fat, it lands in the &#8220;fat&#8221; bin, but small droplets and marbling of fat inside a muscle fiber bundle typically share the pixel with far more water-rich tissue, so the algorithm tags the whole pixel as &#8220;lean&#8221;. This also applies to fibrous scar tissue and edema in that DXA cannot distinguish them from contractile muscle.</p><p>This is known in the literature using DXA.</p><ul><li><p>In studies using DXA in Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy (DMD), <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23072-5\">we see notes like</a>: &#8220;Accumulation of fibrous tissue in boys with DMD can also affect lean body mass measures because DXA does not differentiate between healthy muscle and fibrous tissue and, therefore, measures of functional muscle mass could be overestimated. As DMD progresses, the percentage of total muscle volume decreases as muscle is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. DXA does not differentiate fat infiltration from intermuscular or subcutaneous fat, and therefore cannot provide a completely accurate interpretation of fat distribution.

      "script_text": "This was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here. If you’re looking to acquire Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Retatrutide or other GLP-1RA drugs at an extremely low price of around $15-$40 per month, see this article.\n\nThere’s a loud minority online that hates the idea of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs (GLP-1RAs) like Ozempic and Tirzepatide. They don’t like that they allow people to ‘cheat’ their way to weight loss, that the drugs make it ‘too easy’ to lose weight. The ideas that people can inject a simple fix to their problems or that a drug can be unambiguously good just doesn’t sit well with them, so they invent and latch on to bad reasons to dislike GLP-1RAs. They make claims like:\n\nGLP-1RAs don’t work because you have to keep on them, just like how you have to keep exercising and dieting to maintain weight loss normally.\n\nGLP-1RAs cause thyroid cancer, even though that association doesn’t seem to be supported.\n\nGLP-1RAs are making people blind on a staggering scale, even though that’s implausible and seemingly untrue.\nNot one of the numerous alleged, major downsides of GLP-1RAs has held up to scrutiny so far, and it’s not clear why they would when the trial results so clearly show tolerability, that the drugs have been in use for long enough and with enough prescriptions for major downsides to be apparent, and that the mechanisms behind the drug are so benign and commonplace. The mechanism in question is neural GLP-1 agonism, and we know that operations that create relatively high levels of endogenous GLP-1 production— like Roux-En-Y gastric bypass —are safe, meaning that there’s a large amount of excellent, long-term data to reassure us that GLP-1RAs should be too.\nOne popular argument against GLP-1RAs is that they lead to excessively high muscle mass loss compared to standard, non-pharmacological weight loss. Some people have even taken this so far as to claim that GLP-1RAs lead to more muscle than fat loss. Both points are difficult to credibly support, but there is at least something intuitively sensible about the first claim even if a pharmacological mechanism is absent. A pretty apparent fact is that the people who use GLP-1RAs tend to be lazier: they tend to exercise less and eat worse than people losing weight the traditional, non-drug assisted way. That could have predictable consequences for the ratio of muscle to fat loss, or so the logic goes.\nWhether the logic actually holds is another matter.\n\nClaim #1: Do People Lose More Muscle Than Fat?\nThe claim here is that people cut weight with GLP-1RAs primarily by losing muscle rather than fat, thus worsening body composition after drug-assisted weight loss. This position is not supported empirically. In each trial, the opposite is true: people lose more fat than muscle, improving their body composition as they lose weight.\nIn a major trial of Semaglutide, the treatment group lost an average of 8.36 kilograms of fat and 5.26 kilograms of lean body mass. The placebo group lost an average of 1.37 kilograms of fat and 1.83 kilograms of lean body mass. The relative contributions of fat to weight loss were 61.4% for the GLP-1RA group and 42.8% for the group losing weight with a placebo.\nIn a major trial of Tirzepatide, the treatment group lost 33.9% of their total fat mass and 10.9% of their lean mass, versus 8.2% and 2.6% for the placebo group. Both outcomes were favorable, but the treated participants fared better: “The ratio of total fat mass to total lean mass decreased more with tirzepatide (from 0.93 at baseline to 0.70 at week 72) than with placebo (from 0.95 to 0.88).” Similarly, in a relatively short trial of Retatrutide(Poster-474), participants saw considerable weight loss which was two-thirds fat and one-third lean.\nSimilar ratios are observed in different trials and these results are entirely typical across the literature. The only net unfavorable compositional result came from a trial of a less effective, daily-dosed older generation of GLP-1RA drug, Liraglutide. That failure was a narrow one (60% lean mass loss) in a very low-power substudy which also produced the nonsensical result—which failed to replicate—that a higher dose led to less weight loss.\n\nClaim #2: Is the Muscle Loss Ratio Unusually High?\nThe claim here is that GLP-1RAs cause more muscle loss than would be expected given the same amount of weight loss done without pharmacological assistance, such as through using diet, exercise, or bariatric surgery. A simple way to answer this is to plot body weight loss versus lean body mass loss across different intervention regimes conducted on similar populations. That was recently done in a paper in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe data here contains considerable noise, but the picture is nevertheless clear: at similar levels of total body weight loss, diet, GLP-1RAs, and bariatric surgery produce clinically comparable and statistically indistinguishable reductions in lean body mass. This fact has been pointed out in GLP-1RA trials; for example:\n\nParticipants treated with tirzepatide had a percent reduction in fat mass approximately three times greater than the reduction in lean mass, resulting in an overall improvement in body composition. The ratio of fat-mass loss to lean-mass loss was similar to that reported with lifestyle-based and surgical treatments for obesity.\nBut this does not actually answer the claim because it’s about muscle loss. Lean mass measurements are a great proxy for muscle, but lean mass is not just muscle, as it also includes water, bone, and other tissues, in addition to fat infiltration. 1 There is, however, one brand-new study that does provide an answer using MRI-based measurements from the SURPASS-3 trial of Tirzepatide and from the U.K. Biobank.\nThe study looked at individuals in the large and popular U.K. Biobank cohort and assessed the relationship between non-pharmacological weight loss and muscle loss so that ‘normal’ weight loss could be compared to the weight loss in a matched cohort that lost weight using GLP-1RAs. The relationships in either cohort, as it turns out, were high and statistically indistinguishable:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis, however, does not inform us enough alone about whether there was more or less muscle loss, as it could have been the case that the intercepts differed. To get to that answer, the amount of muscular volume lost at a given amount of weight loss has to be compared directly. The answer from that analysis was favorable: those on Tirzepatide lost 0.04 liters more muscular volume at the same level of weight loss, which is both clinically unimportant and was statistically nonsignificant ( p= 0.22).\n\nClaim #3: Do GLP-1RAs Produce Muscular Dysfunction?\nWe now know that GLP-1RAs produce more fat loss than muscle loss and that the muscle loss from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is comparable to the muscle loss that comes with lifestyle-based weight loss and from surgery. But now we have to ask: do GLP-1RAs make people unusually weak? It’s one thing to maintain muscular volume, but it may be quite another to maintain muscular quality.\nThere are considerable reasons to disbelieve the claim that muscular dysfunction follows from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss. The evidence above indicated that muscular volume is maintained, and that alone is very strong evidence that this belief is unfounded, but it is not itself dispositive. In the comparison between Tirzepatide-based weight loss and weight loss in the U.K. Biobank, additional evidence came in the form of observations about fat infiltration.\n\nImage: Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\n\n\n\nAldona Griskeviciene/Shutterstock.com\nFat infiltration, or myosteatosis, refers to the condition where fat gets in and between muscle fibers. This happens to everyone to varying extents, and it’s particularly marked with age. Moreover, it is strongly related to reduced strength, and increases in it seem to cause frailty and physical weakness. More importantly, reductions are accompanied by improved physical functioning. There’s high-quality documentation of this fact based on individuals who have received Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses. Their operation did cause weight loss (-30%), did cause fat loss (-48%), and did cause both lean mass loss (-13%) and reductions in absolute strength (-9%). However, relative strength increased by a much more substantial margin (+32%), and this improvement came with significant improvements in physical performance measures, like improved walking speed and heightened physical activity levels. 2\nThis is what is expected with any intentional weight loss efforts aimed at improving body composition and weight level. That should not come as a surprise since fat genuinely impedes muscular function. Relatedly, in individuals experiencing disease-related wasting and among those with metabolic disorders, fat infiltration tends to increase as weight declines, suggesting our eyes aren’t playing tricks on us and that those individuals are experiencing unhealthy weight loss.\nHere’s the kicker: fat infiltration falls with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss, as it does with non-pharmacological weight loss. This finding holds both compared to a control drug (shown below) and compared to the weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample (-0.42pp, p< 0.0001). 3 Therefore, we should have it as our prior that this sort of weight loss is not unlikely to improve rather than degrade muscular function, given everything else we know.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSattar et al. 2025, Figure 1A, 1-2\nWe can take this reasoning several steps further by noting, for example, that there is no apparent excess reduction in metabolism after taking GLP-1RAs, indicating that the weight loss is metabolically healthful. Or, to take things to their logical conclusion, we could simply look at what participants in trials report about their physical functioning. That means reporting significantly fewer physical limitations in daily life and otherwise improved physical functioning and even quality of life.\nOne could reasonably say that participants are overhyping the benefits to quality of life or physical functioning, but given all the other evidence, that argument rests on unsolid ground and it would be more reasonable to claim that the changes are real and correctly being observed by patients. This is even more strongly supported by observations regarding health, like those based on the reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in lung function, and even based on reported social improvements. Social improvements, I feel, should be viewed as indications of health improvements, since if people are socializing more, are going out more, and are off their couch in general, they’re probably doing other things that are more healthful and which were more difficult when they were fatter.\nAll lines of evidence point to GLP-1RAs improving rather than worsening muscle quality and physical functioning. Though there is reason to be concerned about individuals who are at-risk for sarcopenia using the drugs when they should not, that is not an indictment of GLP-1RAs in general use or mechanistically. 4 It is, instead, a point of caution doctors should keep in mind when making the choice to prescribe these drugs.\n\nStrong Priors: Weight Loss is Therapeutic\nOn the basis of the existing evidence, we can confidently state this: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to be unique except in as much as GLP-1RA users are self-selected. With this statement of the evidence in mind, the weight loss that people are undergoing using GLP-1RAs should be regarded as health-promoting as much as weight loss in general is. 5\nConcerns about induced frailty and so many other alleged side effects of GLP-1RAs run counter to the evidence and routinely lack any semblance of biological plausibility or any sort of statistical credibility. If I had to bet, that will remain true and scientifically unsupported concerns will continue to dominate the GLP-1 debate.\n\nJune 18th 2025 Update: The COURAGE and EMBRAZE Trials\nSeveral companies are developing products to reduce the amount of lean mass loss that occurs during GLP1-RA-induced weight loss. While this effort does not seem justified based on the existence of excess GLP-1-RA-related lean mass loss, it’s still justified for the reason that it’s generally good to lose less lean mass. Furthermore, if people fear excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RAs, regardless of that fear’s reality, a company might be able to profitably sell something to address that concern, which could be good for its bottom line. It’s hard to blame companies for exploiting this fear.\nRegeneron(COURAGE) and Scholar Rock(EMBRAZE) recently released preliminary phase II trial results showing the success of their myostatin inhibition-based approaches. Without inhibitors, those in Regeneron’s semaglutide weight loss group dropped 34.5% lean mass and those in Scholar Rock’s tirzepatide weight loss group saw 30.2% lean mass loss. These were, respectively, nonsignificantly better and worse than the major trials cited above. Inhibitors seemed to be tolerated well and they did reduce the percentages of weight loss that was lean. The fat-free mass loss percentages in these trials were not significantly different or clinically distinct from the traditional loss range given by the well-known “ Quarter Fat-Free Mass Rule ”. Given the relative laziness of these users compared to people undergoing normal weight loss, there seems to be basically nothing abnormal here, consistent with the results presented above.\nIf we throw together percentages of lean mass lost with ketogenic diet, the traditional fat-free mass loss rule (25%, 20-30%), the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials, rapid and slow “ successful ” weight loss, bariatric surgery, the Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment results from Keys’ The Biology of Human Starvation stratified by weeks 1-12 versus 12+ (see discussion here), as well as typical values for older pharmacotherapies like orlistat and non-incretin agents, dieting in insulin-sensitive versus resistant subjects, people undergoing typical combination diet, aerobic, and resistance exercise regimes, and so on, then we’ll have some healthy comparisons. I’ve omitted values for crash diets, ‘good practice’ high-protein very-low-calorie diets, mixed diet plus aerobic and resistance exercise regimens, and things that have not held up well, like chromium picolinate supplementation, as the heterogeneity in the literature is just too much to deal with.\nThe usual caveats for this domain apply, as there is a lot of heterogeneity in sampling, there’s error in measurement, bias in publication, and so on, so take this all with a pinch of salt and imagine that the presented numbers are point-estimates for reasonably-wide ranges. On that point, I don’t include confidence intervals for every value, and the Quarter FFM interval is the typically-cited range. Without further ado:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nFor most people, there’s nothing alarming about the composition of weight loss from GLP-1RAs when compared to a sampling from the wider literature. These loss ratios seem to be fine and at a level where weight loss is certainly healthful, especially for individuals suffering from serious obesity. With that said, semaglutide may be statistically—but not typically clinically—worse than tirzepatide across the published literature, and perhaps low-dose myostatin inhibitors could make both superior to most other weight loss approaches, if not in terms of the total lean mass loss ratio itself, then in terms of that in combination with the feasibility of treatment.\nThough I did not illustrate it, Regeneron’s high-dose trevogrumab and garetosmab therapy was superior in terms of lean mass loss to almost everything on this chart and it was superior to everything on this chart feasibility- and absolute loss in a given amount of time-wise, but garetosmab tolerability left something to be desired.\nThe results of the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials are encouraging regardless of the validity or lack thereof of worries over excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.\n\nJune 21st 2025 Update: A Systematic Review of GLP-1RAs\nThere’s a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on GLP-1RA effects on body composition and its results are worth mentioning.\nAcross twenty-two randomized controlled trials of varying lengths, drugs, and dosages, GLP-1RAs were associated with 3.55 kilograms of lost weight, 2.95 kilograms of lost fat mass, and 0.86 kilograms of lost lean mass. You might notice that 2.95 + 0.86 = 3.81, not 3.55, so something is amiss. You’d be right: all the estimates aren’t matched; not every study reported each outcome, so there’s a bit of noisiness. But, using these numbers, we can get a plausible range of values for the lean mass percentage. If we use the fat mass loss as a percentage of the overall body weight loss, GLP-1RAs are associated with 16.9% lean mass loss, and if we use the lean mass loss, the number is 24.2%, and if we reason from the sum of the lean and fat mass loss numbers, the lean percentage is 22.6%. Per the authors, lean mass loss generally comprised “approximately 25% of the total weight loss”, consistent with the Quarter FFM Rule.\nIf we look specifically at the results for top-line GLP-1RAs in use today, we see that they had reports on 15 mg weekly tirzepatide, 1 mg weekly semaglutide, and 14 mg daily oral semaglutide, in addition to reported on liraglutide given at dosages of 1.8 or 3.0 mg. Comparing the lean mass percentages for these different drugs is possible, and I’ve added a chart of this in this footnote 6, but I want to advise that I don’t think simply comparing fat loss percentages without contextualization is the right approach. The reason is, different trials led to different total weight loss, and total weight loss moderates the extent of lean mass loss. If you lose enough weight, you will eventually lose both more and a higher percentage of lean mass. It’s unclear if this happens in the range seen in these studies. Indeed, one could easily argue the opposite, but for low amounts of lost weight, because the first weight to go is lean mass in the form of water weight. So, we’ll isolate our view to the endpoints of trials with significant and positive weight loss.\nAs with the overall results, there is some imprecision due to unmatched estimates, so keep that in mind. Tirzepatide (15 mg/week) led to 10.81 kilograms of lost weight, of which 8.75 were fat and 1.84 were lean. Taking the lean percentage from the sum, we get 17.4%, or from the total based on fat mass lost, we get 19.1% versus 17.0% reasoning from fat and lean mass losses, respectively. For semaglutide (1mg/week), there were 6.24 kilograms of total weight lost, of which 4.37 were fat and 1.22 were lean. The same numbers were 16.4%, 30%, and 19.6%. For oral semaglutide, total losses were 2.60 kilograms, with 2 kilograms of fat and 0.60 lean, for 23.1% lean mass losses.\nIf we take all the aggregated treatment effects with weight loss in this review, we can assess the slopes for fat and lean mass loss versus total weight lost straightforwardly. By contrasting these slopes, we can gather an expectation about lean mass loss as weight loss grows. 7\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIn general, this weight loss seems to come with roughly one-fifth lean mass loss, and the slopes aren’t driven by either the tirzepatide datapoint or the estimates with nonsignificant total losses. Even removing all of them doesn’t really change the picture. The authors of the paper used the individual study point estimates when they did a meta-regression similar to this, and they found slopes of β = 0.7 and 0.09 for fat and lean mass loss, respectively. Their estimates were even more favorable towards GLP-1RAs than the estimates I made from the aggregated numbers. In both cases, linearity seemed tenable enough.\nThis review provided substantial and clear evidence: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to produce meaningfully different compositional effects than typical weight loss, as represented by the Quarter FFM Rule.\n\nJune 23rd Update: The Age of Mass-Market Monoclonals?\nToday, Eli Lilly gave an incredible presentation at the ADA 2025 meeting. They showed the results of treating people with their activin type-II receptor inhibitor, bimagrumab, without and without the addition of semaglutide. This trial was allocated 55-56 people per arm to a total of nine different arms, and the efficacy results were nothing short of stupendous. Going solely off of what was presented:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few results to mention here. Let’s go left-to-right:\n\nBimagrumab on its own led to weight reductions, as seen in an earlier phase II trial.\n\nThese reductions were entirely due to the loss of fat.\n\nMeaning, muscle was entirely preserved in bimagrumab-only treatment.\n\nSemaglutide alone led to a proportion of fat loss not distinguishable from the Quarter FFM Rule. It did not lead to excess lean mass loss.\n\nCombination bimagrumab and semaglutide led to compositional improvements.\n\nProportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in typical weight loss.\n\nProportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in weight loss with good control over exercise and diet.\n\nThe pace of weight loss was accelerated over semaglutide-based expectations.\n\nThe dosage of bimagrumab (10mg/kg in low-dose arms or 30mg/kg in high-dose arms) was unrelated to the extent of lean mass preservation, only to weight loss. 8\n\nThis fits with, but, at this dosage, fails to confirm the theory that much lower dosages could still deliver substantially improved lean mass preservation.\n\nReassuringly, bimagrumab did not seem to produce ‘useless’ muscle, as it was at least strength-preserving, and potentially strength-enhancing.\n\nPhysical function was improved.\n\nGrip strength was sustained or improved.\n\nLeptin levels fell by more and adiponectin levels increased by more among the bimagrumab users.\n\nProxied inflammation levels fell more with bimagrumab than with semaglutide alone.\nNow, onto the bad parts.\nFirstly, there’s a statistical caveat here: Eli Lilly primarily presented TOT instead of ITT estimates. These are more favorable to efficacy judgments and they make comparisons with other plots in different studies more difficult. Moreover, the difference may be particularly meaningful in this case, because high-dose monoclonal antibody treatments often come with a lot of side effects. This was no exception, although it should be noted that none of the side effects were “serious”, meaning becoming life-threatening.\nThe side effects that were above and beyond the typical side effects seen with semaglutide were:\n\nMuscle spasms (~50-75% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~6% for placebo and ~9-13% for semaglutide)\n\nAcne (~34-55% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~4% for placebo and 9-11% for semaglutide)\n\nLipid profiles showed an atherogenic shift.\n\nHDL levels decreased transiently in all weight loss groups, but they decreased more for bimagrumab users, and they only returned to baseline by 48 weeks for them, whereas they returned to baseline by 24 weeks for semaglutide users.\n\nFor all treatment groups, HDL levels increased above baseline to a comparable degree after the trial was through, so this is not an ongoing concern.\n\nLDL levels experienced a sustained roughly 10% decline for the semaglutide-only groups, but they experienced a sizable increase for the bimagrumab groups, ranging between 15% for the highest-dose group to 30% for the high-dose bimagrumab-alone group.\n\nThe levels in the high-dose groups that took semaglutide moved back to baseline by 24 weeks after treatment.\n\nLevels for the high-dose bimagrumab-only group dropped down to +18% by 24 weeks after treatment, and in both of the bimagrumab groups using low-dose semaglutide, they seemed to not move at all post-treatment, sticking around at ~13-16% above baseline.\nAll the caveats noted, this antibody treatment clearly has major potential and possible mass market appeal.\nAcne is generally mild and manageable, and muscle spasms are also generally mild, and they’re usually transient. Both are also side effects seen with anabolic steroid usage, and you can just ask bodybuilders how they deal with those issues: they’ll usually say they’re fine, manageable, and worthwhile.(Imagine how much this will help bodybuilders with cut and bulk cycles!) Since steroid users tend to be younger and hardier, they might not even care about the muscle spasms at all, but these could be a bigger issue for the general population and especially for the elderly. The lipid issue is also something seen with anabolic steroid usage, and it is also manageable, but definitely more pesky. The atherogenic effect of LDL accumulates with time, so therapy with bimagrumab might benefit from statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or simply not going on for a very long time. Bimagrumab definitely benefits from being paired with semaglutide to control the atherogenic risk, and it may also benefit if there are bimagrumab-related glycemic control issues down the line. This atherogenic issue might present an issue for the people who want to use bimagrumab to gain muscle, but they are neither here nor there. If there are other side effects like alopecia, those have not come up to my knowledge, and they will need to be investigated. That sort of thing may be a phase IV issue.\nIn the study’s high-dose bimagrumab and semaglutide arm, 94% of participants achieved at least a 30% reduction in fat mass, so given you can very likely just come off to get rid of the acne and muscle spasm side effects while sustaining your weight well due to the preserved muscle mass, a huge number of customers will find this to be worthwhile. When this moves to a subcutaneous dosage factor and the price drops, I am certain we’ll see lots of people clamoring to use this product and products like it. Eli Lilly is also running a trial with tirzepatide instead of semaglutide; it’s likely that trial will see even smaller reductions in lean mass and even greater weight loss, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects.\nBest of luck to Eli Lilly and to every other pharmaceutical company trying to make this a reality. What they’re doing here is nothing short of amazing. They are making weight loss an injectable, and making being—in terms of being muscular and low-fat—increasingly trivial. If companies like Eli Lilly, Regeneron, and Scholar Rock succeed, then Americans will become much more attractive, athletic, and healthy, fast.\nI hope to see more work done in this area to alleviate the issue of lean mass loss with weight loss, even though this study and studies like it show that it’s not a problem that’s unique to or accentuated in GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.\n\nWill I Keep Updating This Post?\nThere will be no more large edits unless something big happens. The evidence is clear enough and anyone still in denial about the fact that GLP-1RAs do not lend themselves to excess lean mass loss is fighting an uphill battle against mountains of evidence.\nI will likely only be doing small edits below, largely by bullet point, as new results come along. I also may go back and edit the parts on Regeneron’s, Scholar Rock’s, and Eli Lilly’s results once the papers are published for the preliminary trial results I covered.\n\nShort Updates\n\nJune 24, 2025: A subscriber sent me Locatelli et al.’s article arguing that adding exercise to incretin-based therapies would help to reduce the extent of lean mass loss. The data they cite overlaps considerably with what I cite here, so not much new on that front. The conclusions they reach are about benefits from exercise also valid, and if you scroll up to the weight loss method vs. compositional change chart I made, you can see evidence for it. As public health advice, their conclusions are not very useful, because motivating people is a major part of the issue with weight in the first place. But there might be utility in telling people that exercise can offset lean mass loss, or that the lean mass loss ratio is broadly similar between GLP-1RA therapy and other forms of weight loss.\n1\n\nThe most common means of measuring lean body mass is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA. When DXA is used, it “sees”:\n\nBone mineral (minerals in bone)\n\nFat mass (soft-tissue pixels whose X-ray attenuation matches adipose tissue, like subcutaneous, visceral, or large seams of inter- and intra-muscular fat large enough to dominate a pixel)\n\nLean soft-tissue mass (everything else, including water, muscle fibers, organs, connective tissue, plus any fat or fibrous tissue interspersed within muscle but too fine-grained for DXA to resolve)\nDXA classifies each 1-5mm pixel into one of these categories based on the ratio of low- and high-energy X-ray attenuation. If a pixel contains mostly fat, it lands in the “fat” bin, but small droplets and marbling of fat inside a muscle fiber bundle typically share the pixel with far more water-rich tissue, so the algorithm tags the whole pixel as “lean”. This also applies to fibrous scar tissue and edema in that DXA cannot distinguish them from contractile muscle.\nThis is known in the literature using DXA.\n\nIn studies using DXA in Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy (DMD), we see notes like: “Accumulation of fibrous tissue in boys with DMD can also affect lean body mass measures because DXA does not differentiate between healthy muscle and fibrous tissue and, therefore, measures of functional muscle mass could be overestimated. As DMD progresses, the percentage of total muscle volume decreases as muscle is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. DXA does not differentiate fat infiltration from intermuscular or subcutaneous fat, and therefore cannot provide a completely accurate interpretation of fat distribution. In some cases, increases in fat mass measures could be a function of background therapy with glucocorticoids rather than a true representation of disease progression.”\n\nResearchers studying adipose tissue depots in HIV patients have noted: “Compared with MRI and CT, DXA cannot separate visceral fat from subcutaneous trunk fat and cannot discern organ fatty infiltration.”\n\nIn a tremendous review specifically to compare DXA and MRI body composition measurements cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the authors wrote: “We found that over the relatively short period of 2.5 years, both muscle and lean mass, as measured by MRI, decreased by 4% to 5% in both android and gynoid regions… The apparent lack of change observed by DXA may reflect its inability to differentiate between these compartments.” And, though DXA and MRI tend to agree, “several interventional studies have suggested that compared with MRI and other gold standard methods, DXA is unable to accurately detect longitudinal changes in lean muscle.”\nResults tend to speak to a systematic overestimation of lean mass that grows as intramuscular fat rises.\n2\n\nFor contrast, see this.\n3\n\nThough this is clinically meaningful in extent and unlikely to purely reflect confounding, I suspect this delta is significantly impacted by residual confounding and that the aging-related nature of so much weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample explains why their weight loss was so inferior in this sense.\n4\n\nRegarding the mechanistic evidence and the impacts of GLP-1RAs on daily life, we now have genetic evidence that GLP-1 agonism is compositionally beneficial in the general population. A quick-and-dirty MR of my own in the U.K. Biobank indicates that genetically-heightened GLP-1 agonism is significantly related to improved health in many areas. Using the data from that study, we see that genetically-heightened levels of GLP-1 receptor agonism are related to lower weight due to lower fat mass and lower fat-free mass, but the effect on fat mass is relatively greater:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAs an aside, these results are such that we can say that some(operative word) number of obese people are obese because they are GLP-1 deficient. As such, GLP-1RAs or other means of stimulating GLP-1 levels could mask their deficiency. This reality invites discussion of what it means to treat conditions like obesity versus “root causes”, as for some, the root cause really is being GLP-1 deficient.\n5\n\nAs an aside, the efforts to identify and promote lean mass preserving GLP-1RAs or complementary drugs to be taken alongside GLP-1RAs seem to be efforts to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. This logic applies equally well to efforts to promote exercise and diet alongside GLP-1RAs as, again, there is no real reason to believe there’s a problem. Additionally, it should be noted that because muscle mass is easier to regain than to gain, this problem is rapidly amenable to remedies if it ever turns out to be a real one.\nPeople may have their concerns—as is their right—but they have no legitimate reasons to transform them into worries for others.\n6\n\nThe graph can be found here:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nThe estimated slopes are not affected by removing the numbers for metformin and sitagliptin.\n8\n\nAdditionally, if we contrast the reports for Healio and the numbers shown on available conference presentation slides, we can see that combination bimagrumab and semaglutide pharmacotherapy might’ve led to continued weight loss after 24 post-treatment weeks, with the semaglutide-alone groups regaining some weight. Importantly, we do not know if this is a correct inference yet, because the consistency of the estimands for these numbers is unknown. I suspect this possible result is actually due to an error in reporting to Healio, as some of their reported “72-week results” are identical to 48-week results. But some differ, so there’s a question of what’s right.\nA bit of carelessness in their reporting might have happened, but that’ll likely be ironed out when the papers eventually drop.",

The topic of the lectures can be summarized as follows:</p><p><em>Are we&#8212;the members of the psychiatric profession&#8212;better at diagnosing patients and predicting their outcomes than simple statistical models?</em></p><p>Ask any clinician this question and the answer will surely be &#8220;Of course.&#8221; Clinicians are wont to remind people that their field is nuanced, complex, and requires a critical eye to the sorts of things you can only figure out through experience. Contrarily, the data that can be obtained from psychiatric patients lacks the granularity and <em>je ne sais quoi </em>needed to match their cultivated, professional understanding of the subtleties involved in diagnosis, prediction, and treatment recommendation.</p><p>Ask Paul Meehl, and he would&#8217;ve said &#8220;No&#8221;, with the data to back it up. Throughout his book<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> he consistently argued that clinicians ought to tilt their eyes towards research and therapy, while leaving the prognostication and classification side of psychiatry within the realm of statistics.</p><p>Meehl&#8217;s argument was based on a bevy of observations, but most notably, that in all but one of twenty studies available to be reviewed at the time, statistical methods performed at least as well and generally better than clinicians: simple statistics beat the psychiatrists eleven times, tied on eight occasions, and lost in just one. It was later discovered that <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241102060353/https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/paul-meehl-a-legend-of-clinical-psychological-science\">the one study showing superior judgment by clinicians was in error</a>: it was really a win for statistical prediction.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> Eleven years later, Meehl reviewed newer literature and found thirty-three statistical wins, seventeen ties, and another win for clinician judgment (which was&#8212;like the first such judgment&#8212;later found to be an error).</p><p>These findings weren&#8217;t colored by disdain for clinicians; Meehl was himself a practicing psychotherapist and, if anything, biased in favor of the exact <em>opposite</em> of the conclusions he arrived at. Nevertheless, his work inspired anger from within his clinical profession, much of which came out as incoherent attacks against him and his colleagues. In <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-12377-001\">later work</a>, Meehl even explicitly pointed out that he had been misrepresented in terms of how dire his conclusions seemed to be for clinicians.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> But time has only vindicated Meehl&#8217;s conclusions, and it has done so for what Meehl believed to be a simple matter of psychology:</p><blockquote><p>Why should people have been so surprised by the empirical results? Surely we all know that the human brain is poor at weighting and computing. When you check out at a supermarket, you don&#8217;t eyeball the heap of purchases and say to the clerk, &#8220;Well it looks to me as if it&#8217;s about $17.00 worth; what do you think?&#8221; The clerk adds it up. There are no strong arguments, from the armchair or from empirical studies of cognitive psychology, for believing that human beings can assign optimal weights in equations subjectively or that they apply their own weights consistently.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a></p></blockquote><p>I think Meehl hit the nail on the head, but he should have gone further: he should have provided a wholesale condemnation of human attempts at holistic judgment.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Humans Don&#8217;t Do Holistic Judgments Well</h3><p>Meehl&#8217;s conclusions have withstood the test of time.

This is not true, and in the time between Meehl&#8217;s initial monograph and this review, plenty of studies had shown that: even when ample qualitative information was provided, statistical models tended to beat clinicians. The authors of the review addressed this directly, hypothesizing that &#8220;the differential accuracy between clinical and statistical prediction would not be affected by the amount of informational cues.&#8221;</p><p>They were right! Increasing the information available to clinicians didn&#8217;t help them; in fact, it did the opposite: more information significantly <em>reduced </em>their judgment quality.</p><p>The issue of data causing <em>harm</em> for predictions is not something that only applies within the psychiatric profession. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3053536\">When parole boards employ subjective judgments about recidivism risk, they underperform simple actuarial judgments</a>. <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/363832\">Medical students who were initially rejected for subjective reasons performed as well as their peers who didn&#8217;t receive a subjective rejection</a>.

In the first study, they showed information about individual airline ticketing agent hires to 132 people who were responsible for hiring decisions. The 132 people were presented with information about hires' general mental ability (GMA, i.e., IQ/intelligence), their conscientiousness, and the rating the applicant received through an unstructured interview. The interview ratings are based on a 1-to-5 scale, where individuals in the sample only ranged from 2-5 because individuals who earned a 1 were not hired.</p><p>In both of this first study's conditions, the decision makers had to use the provided information to figure out which employees out of pairs of presented employees would be more likely to receive the higher performance rating from their supervisor. The first condition provided decision makers with the GMA and conscientiousness information, and the second condition tacked on the rating from the unstructured interview. </p><p>Decision makers did not handle this well.

Whoever did the best would get a cash prize. Unfortunately for those students exposed to the interview, the results of the previous studies held up: interviews, once again, made people more confident and less accurate, even when money was on the line.</p><p>This study is not without precedent or <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/judgment-and-decision-making/article/belief-in-the-unstructured-interview-the-persistence-of-an-illusion/5BBA77932EF22EBEAA1E8020126A1925\">substantially similar replications</a>. It&#8217;s part of a larger literature that tends to support it. Throughout this literature, there are examples aplenty of people being <em>warned </em>about qualitative information&#8212;like being told that interview responses are <em>random</em>&#8212;but still preferring to have that information rather than to drop it. People use this bad or mediocre information and end up making worse predictions as a result, but for various reasons, they are just biased towards evaluations that include it.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a></p><p>Unfortunately, expertise doesn&#8217;t seem to eliminate this bias either. In <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0034156\">Kuncel et al.&#8217;s</a> meta-analysis of the literature on mechanical (i.e., statistical) prediction of job and academic performance, they noted:</p><blockquote><p>These was consistent and substantial loss of [predictive] validity when data were combined holistically&#8212;<strong>even by experts who are knowledgeable about the jobs and organizations in question</strong>&#8212;across multiple criteria in work and academic settings.</p></blockquote><p>And later:</p><blockquote><p>This finding is particularly striking because in the studies included, experts were familiar with the job and organization in question and had access to extensive information about applicants. Further, in many cases, the expert had access to more information about the applicant than was included in the mechanical combination. Yet, the lower predictive validity of clinical combination can result in a 25% reduction of correct hiring decisions across base rates for a moderately selective hiring scenario. That is, <strong>the contribution our selection systems make to the organization in increasing the rate of acceptable hires is reduced by a quarter when holistic data combination methods are used</strong>. Yet, this is an underestimate because we were unable to correct for measurement error in criteria or range restriction. Corrections for these artifacts would only serve to increase the magnitude of the difference between the methods.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h3>Machines Do Holistic Judgments Well</h3><p>Humans do not accurately weight difference pieces of information in their heads to obtain optimal predictions, but machines can. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250403195747/https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes\">The website interviewing.io provided a simple example of just that</a>. In their example, that compared recruiters&#8217; predictions of job candidate performance to the predictions of a random forest model and an XGBoost model. With the information available to them, recruiters performed worse than the out-of-sample performance of both models, and indeed, not much better than flipping a coin. The &#8220;holistic&#8221; judgments from XGBoost, on the other hand, were great.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"709\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:709,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;predictions vs interviewing.io performance&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"predictions vs interviewing.io performance\" title=\"predictions vs interviewing.io performance\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66483c95-2cd2-49dc-a021-995bc8148313_1200x709.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This is not an unusual finding.

      "script_text": "This was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here.\n\nIt’s been seventy-one years since the renowned clinical psychologist Paul Meehl published his landmark Clinical Versus Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence. This text was a monograph that expanded on a series of lectures Meehl delivered between 1947 and 1950 at the universities of Chicago, Iowa, and Wisconsin, and to the employees of the Veterans Administration Mental Hygiene Clinic in Minnesota. The topic of the lectures can be summarized as follows:\nAre we—the members of the psychiatric profession—better at diagnosing patients and predicting their outcomes than simple statistical models?\nAsk any clinician this question and the answer will surely be “Of course.” Clinicians are wont to remind people that their field is nuanced, complex, and requires a critical eye to the sorts of things you can only figure out through experience. Contrarily, the data that can be obtained from psychiatric patients lacks the granularity and je ne sais quoi needed to match their cultivated, professional understanding of the subtleties involved in diagnosis, prediction, and treatment recommendation.\nAsk Paul Meehl, and he would’ve said “No”, with the data to back it up. Throughout his book 1 he consistently argued that clinicians ought to tilt their eyes towards research and therapy, while leaving the prognostication and classification side of psychiatry within the realm of statistics.\nMeehl’s argument was based on a bevy of observations, but most notably, that in all but one of twenty studies available to be reviewed at the time, statistical methods performed at least as well and generally better than clinicians: simple statistics beat the psychiatrists eleven times, tied on eight occasions, and lost in just one. It was later discovered that the one study showing superior judgment by clinicians was in error: it was really a win for statistical prediction. 2 Eleven years later, Meehl reviewed newer literature and found thirty-three statistical wins, seventeen ties, and another win for clinician judgment (which was—like the first such judgment—later found to be an error).\nThese findings weren’t colored by disdain for clinicians; Meehl was himself a practicing psychotherapist and, if anything, biased in favor of the exact opposite of the conclusions he arrived at. Nevertheless, his work inspired anger from within his clinical profession, much of which came out as incoherent attacks against him and his colleagues. In later work, Meehl even explicitly pointed out that he had been misrepresented in terms of how dire his conclusions seemed to be for clinicians. 3 But time has only vindicated Meehl’s conclusions, and it has done so for what Meehl believed to be a simple matter of psychology:\n\nWhy should people have been so surprised by the empirical results? Surely we all know that the human brain is poor at weighting and computing. When you check out at a supermarket, you don’t eyeball the heap of purchases and say to the clerk, “Well it looks to me as if it’s about $17.00 worth; what do you think?” The clerk adds it up. There are no strong arguments, from the armchair or from empirical studies of cognitive psychology, for believing that human beings can assign optimal weights in equations subjectively or that they apply their own weights consistently. 4\nI think Meehl hit the nail on the head, but he should have gone further: he should have provided a wholesale condemnation of human attempts at holistic judgment.\n\nHumans Don’t Do Holistic Judgments Well\nMeehl’s conclusions have withstood the test of time. In a review published 52 years after his work came out, simple statistical models tended to outperform clinicians when it came to predicting and/or diagnosing things as diverse as… 5\n\nBrain impairment\n\nAcademic performance\n\nPsychiatric diagnoses\n\nPsychotherapy outcomes\n\nLength of psychotherapy\n\nPrognoses\n\nMatching MMPI profiles to persons\n\nCompliance with counseling plans\n\nLengths of hospital stay\n\nCriminal offending in general and violence specifically\n\nIQ\n\nSuicide attempts\n\nTraining performance\n\nPersonality characteristics\n\nAdjustment\n\nMarital success\n\nCareer satisfaction\n\nPrior hospitalization\n\nHomicidality\n\nMalingering\n\nLying\n\nJuvenile delinquency\nAnd so on. In this stem-and-leaf diagram, negative effect sizes indicate advantages for statistical prediction:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nÆgisdóttir et al. 2006, Figure 1\nBut, one may argue, these comparisons are unfair to clinicians since they receive less information than the statistical models are provided. This is not true, and in the time between Meehl’s initial monograph and this review, plenty of studies had shown that: even when ample qualitative information was provided, statistical models tended to beat clinicians. The authors of the review addressed this directly, hypothesizing that “the differential accuracy between clinical and statistical prediction would not be affected by the amount of informational cues.”\nThey were right! Increasing the information available to clinicians didn’t help them; in fact, it did the opposite: more information significantly reduced their judgment quality.\nThe issue of data causing harm for predictions is not something that only applies within the psychiatric profession. When parole boards employ subjective judgments about recidivism risk, they underperform simple actuarial judgments. Medical students who were initially rejected for subjective reasons performed as well as their peers who didn’t receive a subjective rejection. In a well-known example involving academic achievement, it correlated almost 30% more with a combination of high school rank and aptitude test scores than it did with a combination of high school ranks, aptitude test scores, and counselors’ intuitive judgments about students. 6\nThe human failure to engage in holistic judgments efficaciously also shows up experimentally.\nIn one experiment I quite like, Kausel, Culbertson and Madrid (KCM) ran a series of three studies that made the issues with holistic judgment abundantly clear. In the first study, they showed information about individual airline ticketing agent hires to 132 people who were responsible for hiring decisions. The 132 people were presented with information about hires' general mental ability (GMA, i.e., IQ/intelligence), their conscientiousness, and the rating the applicant received through an unstructured interview. The interview ratings are based on a 1-to-5 scale, where individuals in the sample only ranged from 2-5 because individuals who earned a 1 were not hired.\nIn both of this first study's conditions, the decision makers had to use the provided information to figure out which employees out of pairs of presented employees would be more likely to receive the higher performance rating from their supervisor. The first condition provided decision makers with the GMA and conscientiousness information, and the second condition tacked on the rating from the unstructured interview.\nDecision makers did not handle this well. They gave a lot of weight to the results of the unstructured interviews:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nKausel, Culbertson and Madrid 2016, Fig. 2\nThe thing that should have been supplied the greatest weight for predicting candidate success was GMA, and it never received more than a bit over a quarter of the weight. Decision makers, instead, relied way too much on conscientiousness in both conditions. But in the condition where data from an unstructured interview was available, they took some weight from GMA and conscientiousness and supplied it to the interview when, in reality, it was worth practically nothing.\nWith the interview in hand, decision makers were more confident about their ability to make the right choice. At the same time, they became worse at making choices because they over-weighted the less useful interview information. Confidence up, accuracy down.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nKausel, Culbertson and Madrid 2016, Fig. 3\nThe second study used a similar design, but the difference in this case was that, in the first study condition, decision makers had access to GMA and conscientiousness, whereas in the second condition, they lost access to conscientiousness. They provided a bit more weight to intelligence this time around, but they still provided far too much to the interview.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nKausel, Culbertson and Madrid 2016, Fig. 4\nThe useful part about this seemingly more constrained design is that it allows evaluating whether decision makers value personality information or the personalities they think they learn about from interviews more. At this point, you might not be surprised to learn that decision makers value the unstructured interview better than the personality measure despite the interview being practically worthless.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nKausel, Culbertson and Madrid 2016, Fig. 5\nIn the third study, undergraduate students were offered the ability to compete in predicting performance using the data from the first study. Whoever did the best would get a cash prize. Unfortunately for those students exposed to the interview, the results of the previous studies held up: interviews, once again, made people more confident and less accurate, even when money was on the line.\nThis study is not without precedent or substantially similar replications. It’s part of a larger literature that tends to support it. Throughout this literature, there are examples aplenty of people being warned about qualitative information—like being told that interview responses are random —but still preferring to have that information rather than to drop it. People use this bad or mediocre information and end up making worse predictions as a result, but for various reasons, they are just biased towards evaluations that include it. 7\nUnfortunately, expertise doesn’t seem to eliminate this bias either. In Kuncel et al.’s meta-analysis of the literature on mechanical (i.e., statistical) prediction of job and academic performance, they noted:\n\nThese was consistent and substantial loss of [predictive] validity when data were combined holistically— even by experts who are knowledgeable about the jobs and organizations in question —across multiple criteria in work and academic settings.\nAnd later:\n\nThis finding is particularly striking because in the studies included, experts were familiar with the job and organization in question and had access to extensive information about applicants. Further, in many cases, the expert had access to more information about the applicant than was included in the mechanical combination. Yet, the lower predictive validity of clinical combination can result in a 25% reduction of correct hiring decisions across base rates for a moderately selective hiring scenario. That is, the contribution our selection systems make to the organization in increasing the rate of acceptable hires is reduced by a quarter when holistic data combination methods are used. Yet, this is an underestimate because we were unable to correct for measurement error in criteria or range restriction. Corrections for these artifacts would only serve to increase the magnitude of the difference between the methods.\n\nMachines Do Holistic Judgments Well\nHumans do not accurately weight difference pieces of information in their heads to obtain optimal predictions, but machines can. The website interviewing.io provided a simple example of just that. In their example, that compared recruiters’ predictions of job candidate performance to the predictions of a random forest model and an XGBoost model. With the information available to them, recruiters performed worse than the out-of-sample performance of both models, and indeed, not much better than flipping a coin. The “holistic” judgments from XGBoost, on the other hand, were great.\n\nImage: predictions vs interviewing.io performance\n\n\n\n\nThis is not an unusual finding. Where humans lack the ability to parse the meaning of lots of different pieces of information together, a model trained to do that can use that information to produce highly accurate predictions. This is true in many areas. For example, it’s possible to predict the development of various cancers and clinical progression from information contained in the electronic health records of medical patients, leveraging information that doctors often won’t even know is related to the conditions models can predict. 8\n\nPeople Are Accountable For Machines\nIf you must use a holistic process for selecting job candidates, university admits, people to prioritize for treatment or care, or anything else, instead try to use a real model. It’ll very likely work better than the biased judgments of humans, and it will probably come close to being truly holistic rather than simply useless or instrumental towards an illicit goal, like discriminating in university admissions. The other big benefit is that a model can be audited, whereas human judgment is much harder to interrogate. Auditing human judgment for bias or error is often impractical.\nFormatted as a policy suggestion, imagine if universities were required to publish their admissions formulas, as the University of Austin just did. Formulas could be audited for fairness and then universities could be compelled to supply the data required to assess their compliance to the formulae they chose to use. This would eliminate the known biases in holistic admissions (see SFFA v. Harvard) and allow universities to be held accountable by preventing them from lying.\nOne can dream.\n1\n\nWhich I consider his magnum opus. This means a lot given how much excellent work he put out over his long career.\n2\n\nWilliam Grove writes:\n\nThis review was the fourth major accomplishment of Meehl in his book. It was also the locus of the only flat-out error in the book that is known to me. In discussing Hovey and Stauffacher’s (1953) study of clinical versus actuarial MMPI interpretation, Paul did not detect a mistake (pointed out by McNemar, 1955) that the original authors made in computing the degrees of freedom on a test.\nSee also, this commentary by Goldberg.\n3\n\nQuote:\n\nSome critics asked a question… which I confess I am totally unable to understand: Why would [my colleague and I] be fomenting this needless controversy? Let me state as loudly and as clearly as I can manage, even if it distresses people who fear disagreement, that [my colleague and I] did not artificially concoct a controversy or foment a needless fracas between two methods that complement each other and work together harmoniously. I think this is a ridiculous position when the context is the pragmatic context of decision making. You have two quite different procedures for combining a finite set of information to arrive at a predictive decision. It is obvious from the armchair… that the results of applying these two different techniques to the same data set do not always agree. On the contrary, they disagree a sizable fraction of the time… The plain fact is that [decision makers] cannot act in accordance with both of [two] incompatible predictions. Nobody disputes that it is possible to improve clinicians’ practices by informing them of their track records actuarially. Nobody has ever disputed that that that actuary would be well advised to listen to clinicians in setting up the set of variables.\n4\n\nThough not directly related, I will note something interesting: humans do not mentally do regressions using OLS, they do something more akin to a Deming Regression.\n5\n\nIn a book chapter Meehl wrote seven years after his three-decade review of the subject, he noted that his conclusions applied to quantities as diverse as predicting business bankruptcy, longevity, military training success, myocardial infarction, neuropsychological diagnosis, parole violation, police termination, psychiatric diagnosis, violence, and more, which others have since agreed with.\n6\n\nFor some additional quotations and details that I found enlightening from this study and some other, related works, see:\n\nFor another finding related to this that I found interesting, see this, which showed that first impressions about job candidates aren’t worth much, but they’re substantially correlated with interviewer judgments following longer-form interviews.\n7\n\nTangentially related to people being bad at using this sort of information: people are bad at describing changes in their own knowledge.\n8\n\nThe flip side of clinical prediction getting good is that there are lots of people today who are obsessed with getting as much medical information about themselves as they can, with no intention of feeding it into these models. The direct meanings of every little biomarker might be worth something, but for almost everyone, they won’t be worth much at all for the simple reason that the deficiencies that haven’t turned pathological (i.e., lack of iodine → goiter; lack of vitamin D → rickets, etc.) usually do almost nothing to people.",

If people were just getting smarter, then all of these scores should have gone up, and to degrees predictable from each tests&#8217; relationship with the general factor of intelligence, <em>g </em>(or &#8220;GMA&#8221; for general mental ability), so that can&#8217;t be it.</p><p>This article is not going to give you a satisfying answer to those questions, it&#8217;s just going to tell you the <em>psychometric </em>rather than the <em>substantive </em>answers.

studies</a> have shown that the Flynn Effect is essentially a problem of test scores becoming incomparable over time, rather than population intelligence changing. After accounting for incomparability, the Flynn Effect and its reversal <em>both </em>tend to disappear, leaving behind no changes in intelligence and meager score changes after they&#8217;re fully corrected for changes in how people understand the tests.</p><p>Why the understanding of tests changes is an interesting topic that&#8217;s worthy of investigation in its own right,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> but it is boring and academic, and that&#8217;s why it won&#8217;t receive the attention it should have. But, that&#8217;s also how the Flynn Effect ought to be: <em>boring </em>and <em>academic</em>, precisely because people are prone to abusing findings that become too exciting.</p><p>People <em>want </em>to think that population intelligence shifts up and down, and that people become smarter and dumber all the time,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> but the reality is that the population practically hasn&#8217;t changed any more than you&#8217;d predict from shifts in demographics. People want <em>explanations</em>, and they often think they have them, even though most common explanations&#8212;education, technology exposure, family size, hybrid vigor, blood lead levels, genomic imprinting, pathogen levels, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/a-requiem-for-nutrition\">nutrition</a>, IQ variability, social multipliers, etc.&#8212;cannot be compatible with the <em>boring </em>and <em>academic </em>psychometric reality of the results.</p><p>I take for granted that the public wants to explain things in real terms. They do not think about methodology when it comes to any topic, and the Flynn Effect is essentially a methodological phenomenon. Because of that fact, the Flynn Effect as understood by the lay public is <em>dead</em> and discourse on it should stop.

      "script_text": "This was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here.\n\nAre we getting smarter? Are we getting dumber? Headlines and anecdotes are bisexual about these questions. The mainstream view is that we’ve been getting smarter and dumber at different times:\n\nPrior to the 1990s, the 2000s, or the 2010s—depending on who you ask—people were getting smarter all the time: the Flynn Effect, as commonly 1 understood.\n\nAfter the 1990s, the 2000s, or the 2010s, people have been getting dumber and dumber, the kids can’t sit down in class and don’t want to work, and colleges are full of dimwits who can’t pass muster in weeders: the “Reverse Flynn Effect” 2 so many have now heard about.\nThere’s something to this mainstream view. Take, for example, the mean IQs over time in this Norwegian conscript data for the years 1957 to 2008:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNordmo, Norrøne, and Lang-Ree 2025, Fig. 3B\nAdults closer to today are much smarter than they used to be, but not quite as smart as they were back in the early 1990s. Right? Not quite. Notice how it’s not every test that’s affected:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNordmo, Norrøne, and Lang-Ree 2025, Fig. 3A\nTo get an idea of what each of these tasks represents, look at these example questions:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNordmo, Norrøne and Lang-Ree 2025, Fig. 1\nNow that you understand what the different tests are getting at, ask yourself: Why might performance on figural matrices tasks have increased so much over time while performance in mathematics stagnated? While we’re at it, why did people only get somewhat better at word similarity tasks? If people were just getting smarter, then all of these scores should have gone up, and to degrees predictable from each tests’ relationship with the general factor of intelligence, g(or “GMA” for general mental ability), so that can’t be it.\nThis article is not going to give you a satisfying answer to those questions, it’s just going to tell you the psychometric rather than the substantive answers. The psychometric answer to each of those questions is the same, and it’s one word: bias.\n\nOne of the most important studies on the Flynn effect was just published in the latest issue of the journal Intelligence. This study is so important because it has a few qualities every other study in the literature lacks. It’s not unique in having a large sample or covering a large period of time; the uniqueness of this study comes from the fact that the same test was given to generations of successive population-representative birth cohorts coupled with the fact that the authors had the perspective to choose to analyze the data in a psychometrically appropriate way.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with the psychometric methods I’m about to describe, go read my explainer article on this topic, here:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption Aporia\n\nBias is Often Unpredictable\nWritten by Cremieux Recueil…\nRead more\na year ago · 66 likes · 10 comments · Aporia\nWhat these authors found was that the Flynn effect is a phenomenon necessarily undergirded by psychometric bias, meaning that what the tests measure changed over time. For example, how different cohorts understood the tests was different, as indicated by the fact that the relationships of the tests with g were not constant over the years:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNordmo, Norrøne and Lang-Ree 2025, Fig. 4B\nThe levels of test-takers’ scores were also not comparable over the years. Every time the authors of this analysis tried to restrain the regression intercepts on g to be equal across cohorts, the model became unacceptably poorly-fitting. Beyond that, there were very likely to be different influences on test scores over time, as indicated by trends in test reliability, so it would have been impossible to find strict factorial invariance in this data.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nNordmo, Norrøne and Lang-Ree 2025, Fig. 4A\nThe authors provided a description of these results in laity-friendly terms:\n\nOverall, the Flynn effect, and the Flynn reversal argued for with these data reflect an increase in the test-specific ability of figure matrices reasoning, not the variance explained by the GMA factor, and the Flynn reversal reflects reductions in test specific abilities in the word similarities and the math tests.\nOr, even more to the point:\n\nObserved increases and subsequent decreases in intelligence scores do not reflect changes in latent intelligence.\n\nAgainst Lay Thinking About Empirical Topics\nTons of earlier studies have shown that the Flynn Effect is essentially a problem of test scores becoming incomparable over time, rather than population intelligence changing. After accounting for incomparability, the Flynn Effect and its reversal both tend to disappear, leaving behind no changes in intelligence and meager score changes after they’re fully corrected for changes in how people understand the tests.\nWhy the understanding of tests changes is an interesting topic that’s worthy of investigation in its own right, 3 but it is boring and academic, and that’s why it won’t receive the attention it should have. But, that’s also how the Flynn Effect ought to be: boring and academic, precisely because people are prone to abusing findings that become too exciting.\nPeople want to think that population intelligence shifts up and down, and that people become smarter and dumber all the time, 4 but the reality is that the population practically hasn’t changed any more than you’d predict from shifts in demographics. People want explanations, and they often think they have them, even though most common explanations—education, technology exposure, family size, hybrid vigor, blood lead levels, genomic imprinting, pathogen levels, nutrition, IQ variability, social multipliers, etc.—cannot be compatible with the boring and academic psychometric reality of the results.\nI take for granted that the public wants to explain things in real terms. They do not think about methodology when it comes to any topic, and the Flynn Effect is essentially a methodological phenomenon. Because of that fact, the Flynn Effect as understood by the lay public is dead and discourse on it should stop. Simply put, laymen are not equipped to and do not need to understand it.\n1\n\nAnd incorrectly.\n2\n\nNot the Anti-Flynn Effect or “Woodley Effect”, which refers to increasing specific skills and declines in general intelligence.\n3\n\nSome people believe that the interpretation of test scores has changed because people play more games now, and those games are like the content traditionally on IQ tests. This makes the most sense for tests like the figural matrices, which are commonly employed in videogame, children’s books, and so on. But this is all neither here nor there.\n4\n\nPeople also want answers to questions like “Why do children seem to be struggling more today in schools?” They usually fail to support the thing they’re wondering about before jumping to explaining it in terms of, say, a Reverse Flynn Effect, but if they were circumspect, they would verify problems exist before attempting to explain them.",

benefits. The superiority of scenarios with benefits to those without is something you may only be able to see clearly if you&#8217;re looking at causally-informative results. Understandably, if you are looking only at cross-sectional data, it can be easy to discount the effectiveness of benefits, because you&#8217;ll only see one or the other series, and it&#8217;s true that both went down.</p><p>This is something fertility benefit skeptics frequently do: they ignore worse counterfactual outcomes to fertility benefits being implemented.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Fertility Benefit Skeptics Don&#8217;t Consider Magnitudes</h3><p>Sometimes fertility benefit skeptics do cite parts of the empirical literature, and if they&#8217;re not being selective with their citations, they&#8217;ll likely still manage to claim that fertility benefits do not work because the effects are &#8216;small&#8217;, and therefore &#8216;not worth the cost&#8217;. This conclusion is in error for two reasons that have to do with magnitudes.</p><p>The first discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the fertility benefits. <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Lyman Stone&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:8919581,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3c062404-95e3-4b54-96a3-875f4ff87641_4000x6000.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;b93cf4d2-82ed-490e-9e58-58baecd2b1b9&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> has already <a href=\"https://archive.md/EfzSG\">produced an informative graph</a> that directly addresses the misinterpretation of this magnitude, so I&#8217;ll just share it for you all here.</p><p>Lyman&#8217;s graph shows France, with and without its pronatal child benefits. In the scenario with them, the total fertility rate is elevated by 0.1 to 0.2 points. It&#8217;s conceivable that people would view that amount as &#8220;small&#8221;, but it&#8217;s harder to maintain that view after reframing it in terms of existing French lives. Put differently, 5 to 10 million Frenchmen (~7-15% of the total 2023 French population) resulting from these policies is <em>definitely not small</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:496,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:640,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf03f582-7ca2-44cb-bfc2-631de7518544_640x496.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>The second discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the lifetime tax revenues of children.

This wasn&#8217;t a big benefit, but it was enough that repeal brought the annual birth rate decrement from -0.76 points to -1.80, then -1.84 the next year, then -1.87 after that, -1.91 in 2017, and finally, -1.94 in 2018.</p><p>Similarly impactful reforms have taken place in many locations.

Milligan&#8217;s paper leveraged the rollout of Quebec&#8217;s broad, pronatalist child benefits of up to C$8,000 to families of newborn children, finding that &#8220;the fertility of those eligible&#8230; is estimated to have increased by 12% on average, and by 25% for those eligible for the maximum benefit&#8221; as well as that an extra C$1,000 of benefits generates a 16.9% increase in fertility. Gonz&#225;lez found that Spain&#8217;s universal child benefits led to a considerable 6% increase in fertility in response to an 8.3% increase in income, driven by reduced numbers of abortions. The Cohen paper observed that reducing Israel&#8217;s child subsidies by the equivalent of 3.3% of income reduced fertility by 9.6%.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-023-09793-z\">a study of the fertility impacts of a universal child transfer in northern Norway</a>, the state covering 58% of the expenses of a child&#8217;s first year of life (12% more than normal) increased the odds of a child among those in their 20s by five percentage points. There was also an increase in the percentage of those with three kids of 1.4 percentage points.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> The effect pushed up fertility among those who were unmarried, but it didn&#8217;t seem to increase poverty.</p><p>In South Korea, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-017-9383-z\">municipality-level childbirth grants and allowances have clear positive effects on fertility</a>. A 10 million won&#8212;or about $8,000 at the time&#8212;increase in family benefits comes with a 3.5% increase in total fertility. The authors projected that, to return Korea to a fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman (from about 1 per woman) would therefore require subsidies of about 44 million won per child. This is very large and likely unworkable, so they should do something else, but at least it&#8217;s apparent that Koreans are not immune to fertility incentives.</p><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-016-9417-x\">The Argentinian government initiated monthly roughly $50 cash transfers to households without workers in the formal sector</a>, leading to about two percentage points higher fertility among those with a child already, and no impact on the childless.

Pessimists towards pronatal policy tend to gloss over or exploit ignorance about this distinction.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230503235403/https://reason.com/2023/05/02/storks-dont-take-orders-from-the-state/\">the piece whose title prompted this one&#8217;s</a>, the author wrote &#8220;The amount of money required to trigger even these small effects is enormous&#8230; &#8216;one extra percentage point of GDP spending&#8217; <strong>on early childhood education and child care programs</strong> was &#8216;associated with 0.2 extra children per woman.&#8217; In the U.S., where the 2022 GDP was $25.46 trillion, that would mean spending more than $250 billion.&#8221; Sadly, this conflation of relatively more and less efficacious programs was not addressed in that now well-cited article.</p><p>The issue of endogeneity when doing cross-country comparisons was also not dealt with at all in that article. That is to say, the author seemed to notice that different countries had different policies and that they were ending up with different fertility levels, but was much less interested in evaluating where their fertility situations would be with different sets of policies. As the bulk of the evidence in the literature indicates, however, pronatal policy definitely works. Each country implements different policies, in different ways, in different pre-existing fertility regimes, so we should expect those places to function&#8212;in a word&#8212;<em>differently</em>, preventing simple, cross-sectional pooh-poohing of the policies implemented in different countries.</p><p>Someone who is serious about whether pronatal policies work would not ignore this issue. Instead, they would cast aside simple claims like &#8216;Hungary does a lot of pronatal policy and their fertility is poor, so it must not work!&#8217; The reality, described <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/pro-natal-policies-work-but-they-come-with-a-hefty-price-tag\">here</a>, is that Hungary&#8217;s pronatal policy is gimmicky and excessively targeted, making it predictably ineffective because the policies do not correspond to anything like best practices. Hungary may appear to be &#8216;all-in&#8217; on pronatal policy and struggling, but that hardly means a thing when going &#8216;all-in&#8217; looks so different from what a competent planner would recommend. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1911555056475812232\">To get an example of what implementing empirically well-supported policy does, look no further than Mongolia. Mongolia was able to adopt simple fixes corresponding to a best practice from the literature and they saw a sizable and sustained bump in births</a>.</p><p>This is not to say that transfers are the only things that should be part of effective pronatal policy.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1681724777080279040\">Family</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-015-0562-z\">leave</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00181-019-01673-w\">policies</a> <em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/124/3/1363/1905162\">do</a> </em><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01270-w\">still tend to work</a>,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a> <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">childcare policies </a><em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">do </a></em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">still tend to work, and healthcare policies </a><em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">do </a></em><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431\">still tend to work</a>.

So, how could we address this? With a shock! And specifically, a shock that should predominantly have its impacts on women's socioeconomic outcomes <em>through their husbands</em>. Luckily, we have OPEC. Or more specifically, we have the coincidence of the U.S. having burdensome domestic regulations and OPEC embargoing it, causing the price of an alternative energy source&#8212;coal&#8212;to explosively increase after holding steady throughout the 1960s.</p><p>The Appalachian coal boom clearly favored the employability of males, as women weren&#8217;t going to be heading into the mines. So, as the crisis set in and coal prices spiked 44% between 1973-74 before stabilizing at twice their price throughout the 1960s, the status of men rose. But after the boom came the bust in the 1980s, as other energy sources were secured, and by 1990, the price of coal had returned to the level it was at in 1970. The boom, the peak, and the bust had clear effects on worker earnings and employment:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png\" width=\"727.9971313476562\" height=\"485.4980869083614\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;normal&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:727.9971313476562,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fec13b88a-d940-4f26-8a0f-4a094647bef8_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Relieving the economic constraints felt by these workers turns out to have been very good for fertility.

Focus on growth&#8212;but perhaps <em>not </em>on redistribution to women&#8212;and we may just lift them and get more babies in the process.</p><p>Others have investigated this thesis and variously found that <a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/more-money-more-babies-part-3-further-evidence-on-the-positive-link-between-income-and-fertility-\">higher economic growth comes with greater fertility rates</a>; that major sources of economic disruption like <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-024-09919-x\">Brexit</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11113-024-09893-4\">the COVID pandemic</a> are likely to harm fertility rates; that the ebb and flow of the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11150-019-09449-y\">business cycle</a> and <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-020-09556-y\">the harms of major recessions affect fertility predictably</a>; etc. And these things are sensible, because <em>raising</em> incomes leads to higher fertility.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Social Multiplication</h3><p>Everything I&#8217;ve said thus far is liable to undersell the benefits of fertility policy because people are social.

If they were encapsulated in all such examples, effects would likely be even larger across the board. In short, what I&#8217;m saying is that the more we raise fertility, the more it&#8217;s liable to rise and self-sustain due to these sorts of knock-on effects. The amount of intervention required for a given boost or level target might fall with time, or it might become more effective as the willingness to have children in response to some stimulus falls. Who&#8217;s to say? We can only know if we try.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Governments Should Be Willing To Do and Pay A Lot</h3><p>I&#8217;ve briefly summarized a great deal of evidence, but I hope I&#8217;ve made it clear that the fertility rate is plastic in response to efforts to raise and lower it. If countries go all-in on credible on pronatal efforts, they can raise fertility rates by substantial margins. This evidence is so strong that, using the median elasticity above, it&#8217;s likely that the U.S. could raise its fertility rate above replacement while spending around 3% of its GDP, and it would still economically benefit substantially because the returns would exceed the costs almost three times over, and that&#8217;s not even accounting for the benefits from society becoming younger and more dynamic.</p><p>If the U.S. focused on economic growth in a more extensive, pro-family way, the required spending on fertility programs would be even lower, while<em> </em>the returns would be even higher given growth means socially raised productivity.</p><p>There is simply no need to be pessimistic about fertility policy, and yet, pessimism is the norm. I believe there&#8217;s no <em>good </em>reason for that. The reasons are variations on a theme of poor inference and poor grappling with the evidence. But with a clear mind and given all the evidence, the conclusion is clear: If we try, we can easily succeed.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\"

      "script_text": "Many people are very critical of the government’s ability to pay people to have children. The skeptical position is so common that, when fertility benefits are mentioned, one invariably earns a retort along the lines of ‘They’ve been tried and they don’t do anything.’\nBut that is not true. I believe there are at least two key errors supporting the belief.\n\nFertility Benefit Skeptics Make Causal Inference Missteps\nOne form of mistake is to consider the wrong estimates of fertility benefit effectiveness. Consider the simulated country with the following data:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe divergent series represent different outcomes for the country if it does or does not implement fertility benefits in year zero. The fertility benefit skeptic sees the series where benefits were implemented and declares “A-ha! They’ve failed!” because the series continued to decline after the benefits were implemented.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nBut the scenario without benefits has substantially lower fertility than the scenario with them. 1\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe plain fact is that both series trended down, but one was worse than the other for fertility, and it was the scenario without benefits. The superiority of scenarios with benefits to those without is something you may only be able to see clearly if you’re looking at causally-informative results. Understandably, if you are looking only at cross-sectional data, it can be easy to discount the effectiveness of benefits, because you’ll only see one or the other series, and it’s true that both went down.\nThis is something fertility benefit skeptics frequently do: they ignore worse counterfactual outcomes to fertility benefits being implemented.\n\nFertility Benefit Skeptics Don’t Consider Magnitudes\nSometimes fertility benefit skeptics do cite parts of the empirical literature, and if they’re not being selective with their citations, they’ll likely still manage to claim that fertility benefits do not work because the effects are ‘small’, and therefore ‘not worth the cost’. This conclusion is in error for two reasons that have to do with magnitudes.\nThe first discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the fertility benefits. has already produced an informative graph that directly addresses the misinterpretation of this magnitude, so I’ll just share it for you all here.\nLyman’s graph shows France, with and without its pronatal child benefits. In the scenario with them, the total fertility rate is elevated by 0.1 to 0.2 points. It’s conceivable that people would view that amount as “small”, but it’s harder to maintain that view after reframing it in terms of existing French lives. Put differently, 5 to 10 million Frenchmen (~7-15% of the total 2023 French population) resulting from these policies is definitely not small.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe second discounted magnitude is the magnitude of the lifetime tax revenues of children. Fertility benefit skeptics seem to believe that child benefits are very costly and children do not provide much in the way of returns to the state after they’ve become adults. This is far from true.\nThe lifetime tax returns of the typical American are in the hundreds of thousands, while the cost of fertility benefits is a pittance. If someone directly returns $200,000 2 to the state while only costing, say, $2,500 per year of childhood (i.e., $45,000), then their existence passes a cost-benefit test with flying colors. Throw in the indirect fiscal benefits of these policy-derived children, and benefits undoubtedly pass muster.\nOne might argue that the wrong sorts of people—those with low total lifetime tax contributions—would reproduce the most in response to fertility benefits. Fair enough, I’ll accept this point even though I place a high value on human life itself. If the point is true and worrying, simply adjust the benefits so that they’re disbursed through non-refundable tax credits, made available as direct tax reductions, provided with means-testing, provided in-kind as subsidized IVF(which only responsible parents should seek), or so on and so forth. My preferred child benefit setup provides massive inducements to be fertile and multiply without a preference for low-tax births.\n\nNow that we’re equipped with the cognitive tools to keep us counterfactually-minded and aware of the magnitudes that matter, let’s look at and qualify empirical estimates of the effects of fertility benefits.\n\nBenefits = Babies\nWhen France introduced means testing to its child allowances, fertility abruptly fell as the rate of decline in the fertility rate increased. This change is unambiguous, and all it took was reducing access to a combination birth or adoption premium, basic allowances, and allowances to support personal and professional life reconciliation.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of this decrease was to change the program from providing unconditional access to the basic allowances (about 180 Euros a month) to only being available in full to the poorest households, with half of the benefit amount being provided to middle-income households and none for the wealthiest French. This wasn’t a big benefit, but it was enough that repeal brought the annual birth rate decrement from -0.76 points to -1.80, then -1.84 the next year, then -1.87 after that, -1.91 in 2017, and finally, -1.94 in 2018.\nSimilarly impactful reforms have taken place in many locations. For example, in Germany, the government cut child-related welfare benefits to the tune of 18% of welfare recipients’ household incomes in the first year after a baby’s birth. 3 The aggregate fertility reduction resulting from this policy was a staggering 6.8% that was immediately felt between the two red lines in this graph, starting in January (first month the reform announcement could affect the birth rate due to abortions) and ending in April (the first month the reform could affect the birth rate through contraceptive use and abstinence).\n\nImage: figure 4\n\n\n\nSandner and Wiynck 2023, Fig. 4\nThe wonderful thing about this German study is that it estimated an elasticity for fertility, and it provided a brief literature review covering some other elasticity estimates. Their estimate was 0.38, which was considerable, but much smaller than the 1.3 ( Brewer, Ratcliffe and dSmith, 2012), 3.9 ( Milligan, 2005), 0.7 ( González, 2013), and 2.9 ( Cohen, Dehejia and Romanov, 2013) that they cited.\nThe Brewer paper exploited the U.K.’s 1999 low-income-targeted reforms that increased per-child spending by 50% with a difference-in-differences approach to show that births rose by about 15% among coupled—not single—women. Milligan’s paper leveraged the rollout of Quebec’s broad, pronatalist child benefits of up to C$8,000 to families of newborn children, finding that “the fertility of those eligible… is estimated to have increased by 12% on average, and by 25% for those eligible for the maximum benefit” as well as that an extra C$1,000 of benefits generates a 16.9% increase in fertility. González found that Spain’s universal child benefits led to a considerable 6% increase in fertility in response to an 8.3% increase in income, driven by reduced numbers of abortions. The Cohen paper observed that reducing Israel’s child subsidies by the equivalent of 3.3% of income reduced fertility by 9.6%.\nIn a study of the fertility impacts of a universal child transfer in northern Norway, the state covering 58% of the expenses of a child’s first year of life (12% more than normal) increased the odds of a child among those in their 20s by five percentage points. There was also an increase in the percentage of those with three kids of 1.4 percentage points. 4 The effect pushed up fertility among those who were unmarried, but it didn’t seem to increase poverty.\nIn South Korea, municipality-level childbirth grants and allowances have clear positive effects on fertility. A 10 million won—or about $8,000 at the time—increase in family benefits comes with a 3.5% increase in total fertility. The authors projected that, to return Korea to a fertility rate of 1.5 children per woman (from about 1 per woman) would therefore require subsidies of about 44 million won per child. This is very large and likely unworkable, so they should do something else, but at least it’s apparent that Koreans are not immune to fertility incentives.\nThe Argentinian government initiated monthly roughly $50 cash transfers to households without workers in the formal sector, leading to about two percentage points higher fertility among those with a child already, and no impact on the childless. Comparing mothers who were eligible to those who were ineligible, the result of the program looks fairly dramatic:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nGarganta et al. 2017, Fig. 2\nThe implementation of Quebec’s Parental Insurance Plan gave the province a more generous version of the Canadian federal Employment Insurance program and led to a considerable bump in fertility. For those without secondary education, fertility increased by 17%; for those who completed it, the jump was 46%; for those with university diplomas, there was a 27% increase in fertility. The effects are quite dramatic and shifted Quebec’s fertility above Ontario’s:\n\nImage: figure 2\n\n\n\nAge-specific fertility rates for Quebec and Ontario before and after the Parental Insurance Plan went into effect. Laplante 2024, Fig. 2\nAcross different countries and contexts, we see consistent evidence that transfers generate increases in fertility that are sizable in magnitude. In a 2021 review of various pronatal policies, the section on transfers repeated much the same: “Overall, there is quite solid evidence that increases in transfers have an immediate effect on fertility” and this effect was generally sizable. Similarly, estimated an elasticity of fertility to a 1% increase in income of between 0.04 and 0.30.\nLeveraging Lyman’s estimates, the elasticity to the private value of having a child—defined here —would be $287,800/$80,610 ( inflation-adjusted ages 0-18 cost of childrearing 5/household income) in 2023 = 3.57 * 0.04-0.30 = 0.14-1.07 (median = 0.47), thus justifying massive spending for even well-below median performing pronatal programs. 6\nBut even this heartening level of efficacy should be qualified as being unduly pessimistic for a simple reason: relatively effective and ineffective policies are being lumped together to produce those elasticity estimates. Family leave policy, for instance, tends to be less efficacious for promoting fertility than transfers. Pessimists towards pronatal policy tend to gloss over or exploit ignorance about this distinction.\nIn the piece whose title prompted this one’s, the author wrote “The amount of money required to trigger even these small effects is enormous… ‘one extra percentage point of GDP spending’ on early childhood education and child care programs was ‘associated with 0.2 extra children per woman.’ In the U.S., where the 2022 GDP was $25.46 trillion, that would mean spending more than $250 billion.” Sadly, this conflation of relatively more and less efficacious programs was not addressed in that now well-cited article.\nThe issue of endogeneity when doing cross-country comparisons was also not dealt with at all in that article. That is to say, the author seemed to notice that different countries had different policies and that they were ending up with different fertility levels, but was much less interested in evaluating where their fertility situations would be with different sets of policies. As the bulk of the evidence in the literature indicates, however, pronatal policy definitely works. Each country implements different policies, in different ways, in different pre-existing fertility regimes, so we should expect those places to function—in a word— differently, preventing simple, cross-sectional pooh-poohing of the policies implemented in different countries.\nSomeone who is serious about whether pronatal policies work would not ignore this issue. Instead, they would cast aside simple claims like ‘Hungary does a lot of pronatal policy and their fertility is poor, so it must not work!’ The reality, described here, is that Hungary’s pronatal policy is gimmicky and excessively targeted, making it predictably ineffective because the policies do not correspond to anything like best practices. Hungary may appear to be ‘all-in’ on pronatal policy and struggling, but that hardly means a thing when going ‘all-in’ looks so different from what a competent planner would recommend. To get an example of what implementing empirically well-supported policy does, look no further than Mongolia. Mongolia was able to adopt simple fixes corresponding to a best practice from the literature and they saw a sizable and sustained bump in births.\nThis is not to say that transfers are the only things that should be part of effective pronatal policy. 7 Family leave policies do still tend to work, 8 childcare policies do still tend to work, and healthcare policies do still tend to work. The efficacy may be more limited for these measures, but it’s unlikely that anywhere currently struggling with sub-replacement fertility will get their fertility rates up to acceptable levels without engaging in many measures like these, in addition to becoming more pro-housing 9 and pro-growth, because growth, as it turns out, matters.\n\nBooms = Babies\nI have seen way too many people conclude that this graph shows that income barely matters for fertility.\n\nImage: Total U.S. Fertility Rate by Family Income : r/Natalism\n\n\n\nSee also the similar graph from this piece.\nBut… why? If we increased the incomes of anyone along these ranks, their fertility might increase. Just as endogeneity plagues international comparisons, so too does it act as a bugbear for comparisons like these. But, as a simple test, when men win the lottery their fertility tends to increase. In that case, men was italicized with reason: lottery wins had no effect on fertility for women, seemingly because they had greater rates of divorce after they won. Contrarily, men had significantly lower rates of divorce and higher rates of marriage, presumably mediating their increased fertility. 10\nThis finding holds up in natural experimental settings. 11\nAs we know, women tend to want more kids than they have, and indeed in many places with sub-replacement fertility, they want more than enough to beat the replacement level. 12 So, are women lying? Consider the paper’s first result: comparing similarly-educated women living in similarly-expensive locations, completed fertility was positively correlated with husband’s income:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nBlack et al. 2013, Figure 1\nThis finding might be down to selection into marriages. So, how could we address this? With a shock! And specifically, a shock that should predominantly have its impacts on women's socioeconomic outcomes through their husbands. Luckily, we have OPEC. Or more specifically, we have the coincidence of the U.S. having burdensome domestic regulations and OPEC embargoing it, causing the price of an alternative energy source—coal—to explosively increase after holding steady throughout the 1960s.\nThe Appalachian coal boom clearly favored the employability of males, as women weren’t going to be heading into the mines. So, as the crisis set in and coal prices spiked 44% between 1973-74 before stabilizing at twice their price throughout the 1960s, the status of men rose. But after the boom came the bust in the 1980s, as other energy sources were secured, and by 1990, the price of coal had returned to the level it was at in 1970. The boom, the peak, and the bust had clear effects on worker earnings and employment:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nRelieving the economic constraints felt by these workers turns out to have been very good for fertility. Adding them back turns out to have been very bad for it. Those males who experienced the boom had greater fertility, and those who experienced the bust had much worse fertility:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBlack et al. 2013, Figure 8\nThis finding speaks to the fact that women are not lying when they say they want more kids than they have right now. Their fertility is just mediated in complex ways that lifting economic constraints might help to remedy. Focus on growth—but perhaps not on redistribution to women—and we may just lift them and get more babies in the process.\nOthers have investigated this thesis and variously found that higher economic growth comes with greater fertility rates; that major sources of economic disruption like Brexit and the COVID pandemic are likely to harm fertility rates; that the ebb and flow of the business cycle and the harms of major recessions affect fertility predictably; etc. And these things are sensible, because raising incomes leads to higher fertility.\n\nSocial Multiplication\nEverything I’ve said thus far is liable to undersell the benefits of fertility policy because people are social. For instance, in China, ethnic minorities exposed to exogenously lowered Han fertility reduced their own fertility. If this were reversed, and fertility rates went up, the general desire for kids would probably go in the other direction, increasing instead of decreasing, by some margin.\nPeople raised with more kids in the family also tend to want additional children of their own. Raise the average size of families, and you’ll raise expectations and resulting rates in lockstep. Even signing people up to take care of infant simulators seems to increase pregnancy rates: 13\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nThese effects are only sometimes contained in estimates of the benefits of different pieces of pronatal policy. If they were encapsulated in all such examples, effects would likely be even larger across the board. In short, what I’m saying is that the more we raise fertility, the more it’s liable to rise and self-sustain due to these sorts of knock-on effects. The amount of intervention required for a given boost or level target might fall with time, or it might become more effective as the willingness to have children in response to some stimulus falls. Who’s to say? We can only know if we try.\n\nGovernments Should Be Willing To Do and Pay A Lot\nI’ve briefly summarized a great deal of evidence, but I hope I’ve made it clear that the fertility rate is plastic in response to efforts to raise and lower it. If countries go all-in on credible on pronatal efforts, they can raise fertility rates by substantial margins. This evidence is so strong that, using the median elasticity above, it’s likely that the U.S. could raise its fertility rate above replacement while spending around 3% of its GDP, and it would still economically benefit substantially because the returns would exceed the costs almost three times over, and that’s not even accounting for the benefits from society becoming younger and more dynamic.\nIf the U.S. focused on economic growth in a more extensive, pro-family way, the required spending on fertility programs would be even lower, while the returns would be even higher given growth means socially raised productivity.\nThere is simply no need to be pessimistic about fertility policy, and yet, pessimism is the norm. I believe there’s no good reason for that. The reasons are variations on a theme of poor inference and poor grappling with the evidence. But with a clear mind and given all the evidence, the conclusion is clear: If we try, we can easily succeed. 14\n1\n\nIf you would like a plot with all labels, here’s that:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nThe real number is above $500,000, which can easily cover things like the cost of schooling and public services consumed as children.\n3\n\nSandner and Wiynck, the authors of the German study, concluded by noting that the fertility response “found among welfare recipients… seems to be weaker than that of general populations.” Similarly, Reader, Portes and Patrick found that the U.K.’s limitation of means-tested child benefits to the first two children in a family led to perhaps a meager 0.7% lower fertility rate, or a 10% decline in relative terms, with perhaps a 16% reduction in the odds of having a third child. Why the small effect? Perhaps because there was poor awareness of the policy.\nA related fact may be that fertility policy will tend to be less effective for the very poor in general, as their kids are more often unintended. Healthcare policy, as it turns out, may help to remedy this by increasing the number of intentional births and reducing the numbers of unintentional ones.\nThere is very little reason to believe that fertility policy will be ‘dysgenic’ as it were.\n4\n\nSee this note on birth order effects.\n5\n\nSee here for additional notes.\n6\n\nNotably, if the benefit is IVF— the costs of which are relatively modest —, then we probably overestimate costs and underestimate benefits right now due to age-related changes in the success of IVF. Specifically, IVF works better for younger couples, meaning that if IVF is subsidized when it’s relatively more expensive in people’s lives, we should see greater success rates and lower spending on it and attendant procedures. If financial support is provided shortly after infertility diagnoses, the costs could be shrunken relative to the benefits even more greatly with a public subsidy for assisted reproductive technologies. Ben Podgursky is the one who pointed this out to me.\n7\n\nIt is worth noting, but not very relevant here, that the evidence that transfers work in already high-fertility environments is generally negative. Although they may still be effective at relatively high, but still much lower, levels of fertility.\n8\n\nrecently compiled some studies on this topic, but came away with different conclusions. I believe this is due to a different reading. See also, this.\n9\n\nAlthough see this on the effects of housing wealth on fertility in China.\n10\n\nThis replicated a finding from the U.S.\n11\n\nI previously wrote about this here.\n12\n\nNotably, ‘ideal fertility’ numbers are plastic and change in response to income changes, numbers of children people have already, numbers of children people are exposed to in the community and family, etc.\n13\n\nHonorable mention: The old Kibbutzim arrangement where children were communally reared seemed beneficial for fertility.\n14\n\nAnd because immigration is not a sustainable way to growth the population given falling global fertility, it must be pursued.",

For those of us who intend to live well into the future, that&#8217;s not a happy fact, and if we want to live better lives, it&#8217;s a fact that demands a solution. Unfortunately, child benefits intended to promote fertility tend to have only small to modest effects. A problem with that inference is that most child benefits have also been small to modest in terms of generosity. In truth, <em>massive benefits </em>have not been tried, and, indeed, may seem to make little fiscal sense.</p><p>But Robin Hanson has an interesting proposal that might just work, and could fix Social Security in the process. The idea is simple: <em>Let parents claim a portion of the taxes their children pay.</em></p><p>I&#8217;ve taken this idea and edited a bit, but from here on, I will be referring to it as the &#8216;Hanson Scheme&#8217;. I&#8217;ve added in that child policy should include tax credits for each child&#8217;s early years. As an inducement, you could have a modest refundable tax credit, and if your aim is to make the tax credit induce higher-income families to have births because you want births to families who will <em>tend </em>to produce children that pay more taxes, you can also add in non-refundable tax credits.</p><p>The proposal looks like this:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

certain age will be entitled to their benefits, with progressive drop-offs in the amounts younger and younger participants are entitled to. The Hanson Scheme would then see the programme replaced in a pronatal fashion, with payouts to parents in the form of fractions of the taxes paid by their own children.</p><p>In the Hanson Scheme, the lifetime value of the payouts should be left uncapped. This is where the massive pronatal transfer side of the scheme comes in: uncapped benefits from the taxes of people&#8217;s children mean more kids net higher total payouts, and making kids more productive does the same.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> If parents obtain a constant fraction of the taxes their children pay, the upside to a given birth could be enormous. Because the transfers in this scheme are dependent on ongoing taxation and made immediately available, there will not be a funding issue like there has been for Social Security.</p><p>In short, this style of transfer could enable incredibly large, sustainable transfers to people invested in the future of the country.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Raise Your Kids</h3><p>Making payouts contingent on some measure of &#8216;being there&#8217; and an appealable &#8216;doing a good job&#8217; for children prior to adulthood encourages parents to stay loyal to one another, as well as to pay child support, to take responsibility for kids that might be theirs, to avoid abuse, and so on. The Hanson Scheme is one that is aligned with the key, and in many ways, <em>demolished</em>, family value of actually raising your children instead of neglecting or abandoning them. In this sense, the program may help to limit divorces, promote marriages, and accordingly, constrain any of the potential, malign influence of single parenthood.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Parents for Career-Extending Policies</h3><p>The Hanson Scheme would compel parents to prefer policies that extend the time their kids are in the workforce. This means avoiding unnecessary education, like taking general ed classes out of university educations and shortening the time children spend before high school graduation.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> Likewise, parents would be incentivized to have their kids accelerate in school. Acceleration would be both with respect to time and to learning, because that would mean entering the workforce earlier and staying in longer, as well as entering it <em>better</em>, earning more all the while.</p><p>If a grandparental sum is paid out, the Hanson Scheme would also encourage parents to invest in getting their kids into mature adulthood, out of the house, and on their own feet as rapidly as possible. Parents would have an investment, not just culturally, but economically in helping their children to mature. In a world where kids appear to be extending their adolescence well into their 30s, this could be very important.</p><p>The Hanson Scheme means reclaiming kids&#8217; lives from an overgrown education system and encouraging parents to push kids into having families of their own.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Fairness in Fertility</h3><p>The Hanson Scheme is undoubtedly unfair with respect to the infertile. Most of the infertile can be helped with <em>in vitro fertilization </em>and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) available today. Because of this fact, the Hanson Scheme would increase the demand for universal IVF coverage, so that fertility can be further enhanced and made more equitably distributed. Additionally, if there is universal IVF, innovation in ARTs would undoubtedly follow the same trajectory as innovation in areas Medicare and Medicaid touch: that is, there would be more investment in order to capture government funds.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Adopt, Foster, and Raise</h3><p>The Hanson Scheme should be extended to encompass adoptions and fostering. By applying to foster children, it may encourage more of the stereotypical &#8216;bad foster family&#8217; home that over-adopts children and raises them poorly, but it may also increase the diversity of families participating in foster care, potentially improving investments into the system, while almost-certainly improving the availability regardless of its impacts on care quality. Just as well, this could help to bring back adoption, which has declined as a practice in recent years.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Retire Earlier, Perhaps?</h3><p>Because of the scale of these payouts and how they&#8217;ll grow as parents age and their children advance in the workforce, the Hanson Scheme might negatively impact the number of workers by providing parents with enough money to retire quite a bit earlier, comfortably. While possible, I don&#8217;t think this should be a major concern. If if is true, then the program will have been a success, since it will have generated enough additional workers to make earlier retirements possible&#8212;a wonder in its own right!</p><p>A downside of earlier retirements is that there could be reduced time for older workers to pass on their knowledge and skills to the younger crop of workers. I don&#8217;t think this is really avoidable if people do retire earlier on the payouts from their kids&#8217; taxes. An upside is that there would be increased churn in senior positions, and novel ideas would experience greater rates of uptake in the work force, potentially even in academia, and so on.</p><p>Earlier retirement is a truly mixed bag possibility that follows from how potentially generous the Hanson Scheme is, but I believe it&#8217;s worth it.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Clarkian Equality</h3><p>Individuals who have low incomes tend to have children who go on to earn higher incomes, and individuals who have high incomes tend to have children who go on to earn lower incomes. This is a description of regression to the mean, and because of it, the payouts will help to equalize household incomes across generations.</p><p>Parents from poor households will tend to earn more than expected, because their kids will usually out-earn them, and parents from rich households will tend to earn more as well under the Hanson Scheme, but they&#8217;ll still earn somewhat less than they might themselves earn directly.</p><p>This asymmetry possibly dovetails with early retirement incentives, but it also presents an alternative possibility that the very poor, who have somewhat poor kids who will disproportionately not pay any amount or a large enough amount in taxes will not be benefitted much by the system. So, while equality should be promoted with enough mobility, the system may also end up highly regressive in nature, under-providing for the relatively small number of chronically poor workers who age into being retirees.</p><p>But, if a grandparent payout is enabled, then these chronically poor&#8212;who tend to have higher fertility anyway&#8212;would likely end up with at least something by old age, and potentially still quite a bit more than what they could expect under existing Social Security.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Don&#8217;t Cheat Your Parents</h3><p>Most people love their parents. Most people hate paying taxes. People will probably hate paying their taxes less if those taxes are crucial to sustaining their parents&#8217; lifestyles. Moreover, their parents will be aware of non-payment, and they&#8217;ll be tuned into the success of their kids, above and beyond what&#8217;s typical nowadays.</p><p>The Hanson Scheme promotes a society of closer, more internally open families.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What About Disability?</h3><p>Social Security does not just pay for retirees, it also covers the disabled and survivors of parental or spousal death and whatnot. Keep it around for those, but transition retirement over to the Hanson Scheme; that way, the more expensive part of Social Security is eliminated from the budget, and the less expensive, more sustainable, and more genuinely necessary part is kept behind.</p><div><hr></div><h3>What of the Haters and Losers?</h3><p>People who don&#8217;t want to or can&#8217;t have families after all is said and done simply won&#8217;t be provided automatic access to this Social Security replacement. This may seem unjustifiable, but to a family-oriented society, it should be considered a fine trade-off. The reason is, families are accorded more moral value than singles. <em>Families</em> are the basis for the future&#8212;of the country and of humanity in general. Without families, the country dies; with single people alone, it dies. Single people are already leeching from families in a grand sense, and all redistribution from single people away from families reduces the odds society continues and improves. The Hanson Scheme as a Social Security replacement merely reifies acknowledgement of that fact into law and places the family unit on a pedestal, and if single people want in, they have to buy all or part of a transferable right to a person&#8217;s future tax revenues from parents.</p><div><hr></div><h3>The Hanson Scheme in Brief</h3><p>The Hanson Scheme</p><ul><li><p>Incentivizes having kids</p></li><li><p>Incentivizes raising kids, raising them well, and both forming and maintaining families</p></li><li><p>Incentivizes investments in universal IVF and other form of ARTs</p></li><li><p>Incentivizes foster caring and adoption</p></li><li><p>Supports turnover from the old to the young in roles across the economy</p></li><li><p>Promotes equality across households</p></li><li><p>Aligns parents with better educational norms</p></li><li><p>Discourages tax cheating</p></li></ul><p>The Hanson Scheme is worthy of consideration, and I&#8217;m sure I haven&#8217;t noticed all of the benefits.</p><div><hr></div><p>The value to the government of an additional laborer is a very large amount; a higher growth rate means the debt per person can be reduced substantially very rapidly.

You can find my previous timed post here.\n\nGlobal fertility is likely to drop below replacement in the near future. For about half of the world’s population, that’s already the case. 1\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSource: U.N. Population Fund\nMuch of infertile world is the wealthy, developed part that does most of the innovating and building that makes it possible for so many of us to be alive and prospering today. For those of us who intend to live well into the future, that’s not a happy fact, and if we want to live better lives, it’s a fact that demands a solution. Unfortunately, child benefits intended to promote fertility tend to have only small to modest effects. A problem with that inference is that most child benefits have also been small to modest in terms of generosity. In truth, massive benefits have not been tried, and, indeed, may seem to make little fiscal sense.\nBut Robin Hanson has an interesting proposal that might just work, and could fix Social Security in the process. The idea is simple: Let parents claim a portion of the taxes their children pay.\nI’ve taken this idea and edited a bit, but from here on, I will be referring to it as the ‘Hanson Scheme’. I’ve added in that child policy should include tax credits for each child’s early years. As an inducement, you could have a modest refundable tax credit, and if your aim is to make the tax credit induce higher-income families to have births because you want births to families who will tend to produce children that pay more taxes, you can also add in non-refundable tax credits.\nThe proposal looks like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nNow, for the explanation.\n\nReplacing Social Security\nSocial Security is a Ponzi scheme, 2 and without high fertility, its current incarnation cannot work. For the sustainability of the program, the number of people drawing down the fund is just too great compared to the number of new workers being introduced into the labor force. This ratio has fallen substantially over time, owing to improvements in longevity, falling fertility, new financial devices, changes in retirement norms, and increased rates of disability, among other factors. 3\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nSocial Security can be replaced with the modified Hanson Scheme through a multi-decade phaseout period in which individuals past a certain age will be entitled to their benefits, with progressive drop-offs in the amounts younger and younger participants are entitled to. The Hanson Scheme would then see the programme replaced in a pronatal fashion, with payouts to parents in the form of fractions of the taxes paid by their own children.\nIn the Hanson Scheme, the lifetime value of the payouts should be left uncapped. This is where the massive pronatal transfer side of the scheme comes in: uncapped benefits from the taxes of people’s children mean more kids net higher total payouts, and making kids more productive does the same. 4 If parents obtain a constant fraction of the taxes their children pay, the upside to a given birth could be enormous. Because the transfers in this scheme are dependent on ongoing taxation and made immediately available, there will not be a funding issue like there has been for Social Security.\nIn short, this style of transfer could enable incredibly large, sustainable transfers to people invested in the future of the country.\n\nRaise Your Kids\nMaking payouts contingent on some measure of ‘being there’ and an appealable ‘doing a good job’ for children prior to adulthood encourages parents to stay loyal to one another, as well as to pay child support, to take responsibility for kids that might be theirs, to avoid abuse, and so on. The Hanson Scheme is one that is aligned with the key, and in many ways, demolished, family value of actually raising your children instead of neglecting or abandoning them. In this sense, the program may help to limit divorces, promote marriages, and accordingly, constrain any of the potential, malign influence of single parenthood.\n\nParents for Career-Extending Policies\nThe Hanson Scheme would compel parents to prefer policies that extend the time their kids are in the workforce. This means avoiding unnecessary education, like taking general ed classes out of university educations and shortening the time children spend before high school graduation. 5 Likewise, parents would be incentivized to have their kids accelerate in school. Acceleration would be both with respect to time and to learning, because that would mean entering the workforce earlier and staying in longer, as well as entering it better, earning more all the while.\nIf a grandparental sum is paid out, the Hanson Scheme would also encourage parents to invest in getting their kids into mature adulthood, out of the house, and on their own feet as rapidly as possible. Parents would have an investment, not just culturally, but economically in helping their children to mature. In a world where kids appear to be extending their adolescence well into their 30s, this could be very important.\nThe Hanson Scheme means reclaiming kids’ lives from an overgrown education system and encouraging parents to push kids into having families of their own.\n\nFairness in Fertility\nThe Hanson Scheme is undoubtedly unfair with respect to the infertile. Most of the infertile can be helped with in vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs) available today. Because of this fact, the Hanson Scheme would increase the demand for universal IVF coverage, so that fertility can be further enhanced and made more equitably distributed. Additionally, if there is universal IVF, innovation in ARTs would undoubtedly follow the same trajectory as innovation in areas Medicare and Medicaid touch: that is, there would be more investment in order to capture government funds.\n\nAdopt, Foster, and Raise\nThe Hanson Scheme should be extended to encompass adoptions and fostering. By applying to foster children, it may encourage more of the stereotypical ‘bad foster family’ home that over-adopts children and raises them poorly, but it may also increase the diversity of families participating in foster care, potentially improving investments into the system, while almost-certainly improving the availability regardless of its impacts on care quality. Just as well, this could help to bring back adoption, which has declined as a practice in recent years. 6\n\nRetire Earlier, Perhaps?\nBecause of the scale of these payouts and how they’ll grow as parents age and their children advance in the workforce, the Hanson Scheme might negatively impact the number of workers by providing parents with enough money to retire quite a bit earlier, comfortably. While possible, I don’t think this should be a major concern. If if is true, then the program will have been a success, since it will have generated enough additional workers to make earlier retirements possible—a wonder in its own right!\nA downside of earlier retirements is that there could be reduced time for older workers to pass on their knowledge and skills to the younger crop of workers. I don’t think this is really avoidable if people do retire earlier on the payouts from their kids’ taxes. An upside is that there would be increased churn in senior positions, and novel ideas would experience greater rates of uptake in the work force, potentially even in academia, and so on.\nEarlier retirement is a truly mixed bag possibility that follows from how potentially generous the Hanson Scheme is, but I believe it’s worth it.\n\nClarkian Equality\nIndividuals who have low incomes tend to have children who go on to earn higher incomes, and individuals who have high incomes tend to have children who go on to earn lower incomes. This is a description of regression to the mean, and because of it, the payouts will help to equalize household incomes across generations.\nParents from poor households will tend to earn more than expected, because their kids will usually out-earn them, and parents from rich households will tend to earn more as well under the Hanson Scheme, but they’ll still earn somewhat less than they might themselves earn directly.\nThis asymmetry possibly dovetails with early retirement incentives, but it also presents an alternative possibility that the very poor, who have somewhat poor kids who will disproportionately not pay any amount or a large enough amount in taxes will not be benefitted much by the system. So, while equality should be promoted with enough mobility, the system may also end up highly regressive in nature, under-providing for the relatively small number of chronically poor workers who age into being retirees.\nBut, if a grandparent payout is enabled, then these chronically poor—who tend to have higher fertility anyway—would likely end up with at least something by old age, and potentially still quite a bit more than what they could expect under existing Social Security.\n\nDon’t Cheat Your Parents\nMost people love their parents. Most people hate paying taxes. People will probably hate paying their taxes less if those taxes are crucial to sustaining their parents’ lifestyles. Moreover, their parents will be aware of non-payment, and they’ll be tuned into the success of their kids, above and beyond what’s typical nowadays.\nThe Hanson Scheme promotes a society of closer, more internally open families.\n\nWhat About Disability?\nSocial Security does not just pay for retirees, it also covers the disabled and survivors of parental or spousal death and whatnot. Keep it around for those, but transition retirement over to the Hanson Scheme; that way, the more expensive part of Social Security is eliminated from the budget, and the less expensive, more sustainable, and more genuinely necessary part is kept behind.\n\nWhat of the Haters and Losers?\nPeople who don’t want to or can’t have families after all is said and done simply won’t be provided automatic access to this Social Security replacement. This may seem unjustifiable, but to a family-oriented society, it should be considered a fine trade-off. The reason is, families are accorded more moral value than singles. Families are the basis for the future—of the country and of humanity in general. Without families, the country dies; with single people alone, it dies. Single people are already leeching from families in a grand sense, and all redistribution from single people away from families reduces the odds society continues and improves. The Hanson Scheme as a Social Security replacement merely reifies acknowledgement of that fact into law and places the family unit on a pedestal, and if single people want in, they have to buy all or part of a transferable right to a person’s future tax revenues from parents.\n\nThe Hanson Scheme in Brief\nThe Hanson Scheme\n\nIncentivizes having kids\n\nIncentivizes raising kids, raising them well, and both forming and maintaining families\n\nIncentivizes investments in universal IVF and other form of ARTs\n\nIncentivizes foster caring and adoption\n\nSupports turnover from the old to the young in roles across the economy\n\nPromotes equality across households\n\nAligns parents with better educational norms\n\nDiscourages tax cheating\nThe Hanson Scheme is worthy of consideration, and I’m sure I haven’t noticed all of the benefits.\n\nThe value to the government of an additional laborer is a very large amount; a higher growth rate means the debt per person can be reduced substantially very rapidly. We already know that immigration is a substantial tool in the arsenal for reducing the national debt, and births could average even better. People do respond to cash incentives when it comes to having kids (see: the repeated hammering on this point from), and this is just a very large cash incentive, so I don’t doubt it would have a considerable effect.\nBut being so large, would it be worth it?\nCertainly! IVF is expensive, and IVF still easily passes a cost-benefit test. Even siphoning off a sizable fraction of each additionally-born laborers’ lifetime tax revenue to their parents would leave that statement true. 7 There is no doubt that going all-in on massive, direct, child-to-parent transfers 8 would be good for the budget if it acts as a sizable stimulus to the birth rate.\nThe Hanson Scheme should not be all the pronatal policy governments attempt. They could do it and also support tax credits—as noted above—and efforts to reduce the cost of child care, push back against abortions, create cultural impetus (e.g., in the form of ‘medals for mothers’ if it can be set up in a workable way), engage in tax burden reductions for parents, structure pro-family leave policies, and so much else.\nBut if the society-wide pro-family realignment entailed by the Hanson Scheme doesn’t work, then God help us, because I don’t see much else that would do better.\n1\n\nIn a previous version of this chart, I had a plotting error that resulted in incorrect lines. This has now been corrected in this version. The U.N.’s provided data is also imprecise, resulting in this chart looking somewhat optimistic for global fertility in both of the years I’m displaying data for.\n2\n\nI am fully aware of why people reject this framing, and I find the particular argument that Ponzi schemes are fraudulent and Social Security is not to be risible rather than serious due to its irrelevance. Calling Social Security a Ponzi scheme seems apt and understandable, which is why it’s valuable, even if it’s not a wholly accurate description.\n3\n\nChanging the inflation measure used for cost of living adjustments to a slower one and raising the retirement age could also go a long way to improving the sustainability of Social Security, but they would ultimately only be stop-gaps, much like immigration, uncapping contributions, and raising payroll taxes.\n4\n\nIt is worth noting here that the costs of parenting scale sublinearly with the number of children, whereas the returns under the Hanson Scheme would likely be about linear in the number of children. Parental age and mutational load effects militate against this strict linearity in expectation, but parents also improve at parenting as they age up, as a counterbalance.\n5\n\nSince time in higher education is a major reason for people to delay childbearing and family formation, reducing time there also helps to promote earlier family formation, encouraging fertility organically through that route.\n6\n\nAnother practice this might bring “back” or, for most ancestries in the U.S. forwards, is arranged marriage to promote high-tax yield children and parenting that aligns on child investment preferences.\n7\n\nAdditionally, it might even make sense to couple this with progressive tax reductions with child numbers, so parents of many children have reduced personal income tax levels. Since parental payouts would likely be primarily out of payroll taxes, this may not be as problematic for the tax base as it seems at a glance.\n8\n\nAt a strongly fixed percentage, to avoid parents dominating their kids’ pocketbooks.",

At NYU, non-admitted White and Asian students performed marginally and substantially better than Hispanic and Black admitted students, respectively. This could be due to differences in discrimination by the admissions departments, or to other factors like NYU not being the first choice for high-performing Hispanic and Black students as often, and high-performing Whites and Asians having fewer options. Since Columbia is an Ivy League university with a great deal more cachet than NYU, it&#8217;s likely that it&#8217;s the first choice for more people, so they&#8217;re more likely to attract elite students and to leave behind narrower test scores gaps post-selection, and that effect couples with test-optionality biasing Black and Hispanic scores upward.</p><p>With these factors in mind, these results&#8212;though less dramatic at a glance than NYU&#8217;s&#8212;are just as indicting. If we throw in ACT results, the fact that Columbia must be racially discriminating becomes even clearer: <em>rejected Asian students <strong>substantially </strong>outscore admitted Blacks.</em></p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png\" width=\"1456\" height=\"951\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/af5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:951,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:245222,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/166755139?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ovaW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faf5f22f8-8703-4ecf-972c-254a7f5485d8_3675x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>With more common criteria, the picture becomes much more like NYU&#8217;s, with Columbia clearly rejecting more qualified Whites and Asians than the Hispanics and Blacks they choose to admit. That means White and Asian students tend to have better GPAs, more extracurriculars, and&#8212;quite likely&#8212;better personalities and higher levels of other achievements, as we saw in the <em>SFFA v. Harvard</em> case. Virtually <em>every </em>qualification favors White and Asian students, and yet they&#8217;re still admitted less, at a level not explicable by things like legacy status, athletics and faculty relationships, and so on.</p><p>In other words, Columbia is clearly discriminating. When you try to predict admissions from test scores or GPAs, or a combination thereof, you consistently see that Asian students are underadmitted relative to those academic qualifications. This race interaction effect is large and significant regardless of how you permute the models, and it always indicates that, at the same level of legitimate qualifications, Blacks are more likely to be admitted than Hispanics, who are more likely to be admitted than Whites, who are more likely to be admitted than Asians.</p><p>If race is not considered in admissions and there aren&#8217;t major compensatory factors afoot&#8212;which has never been the case on investigation&#8212;then the model coefficients should not be this way. We know from this data that the gaps shown above should be smaller if offers were made to everyone in order of their qualifications without consideration of race. Race coefficients should all be nonsignificant and small; admissions should be like going down a list in order of academic qualifications and ignoring race, leaving behind no race effect. And yet, we got a race effect.</p><p><strong>Columbia is still discriminating, </strong>and their attempt to suggest otherwise <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250403034243/https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2024/09/18/black-first-year-enrollment-drops-at-columbia-college-seas-after-affirmative-action-ban/\">by discriminating somewhat less</a> is just an attempt to cover their behinds.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Force Self-Incrimination</h3><p>University after university has only feigned compliance with the <em>SFFA v.

But it should not, because they&#8217;re just reducing the magnitude of discrimination, while continuing to engage in it, and that&#8217;s not good enough. <em>SFFA v. Harvard</em> said to stop discriminating, full-stop.</p><p>So, how do we stop universities from continuing to violate the law like NYU and Columbia have been doing? Through gathering and releasing more data.

Right now, anyone can go access IPEDS and obtain information on student test scores and demographics for different universities alongside a bundle of other interesting pieces of information. But it&#8217;s not enough. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775722000322\">As noted by the primary researcher in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775722000322\">SFFA</a></em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775722000322\"> case</a>, Peter Arcidiacono:</p><blockquote><p>The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides information on total applications, admissions, and enrollment for all institutions that participate in federal student aid programs, but does not disaggregate the data by race or SAT score. A simple change in the data collection practices would generate a clearer picture of the role race plays in the admissions process at American colleges and universities, as well as help high school students make more informed decisions about where to apply to college.</p></blockquote><p>The President can force IPEDS to enforce data collection standards that will make it unambiguous whether universities like Harvard, NYU, and Columbia are acting in violation of the law. They can go much deeper than merely providing race and sex breakouts, too. Universities should be forced to provide extensive, ideally individual-level data, both for applicants and for attendees, so that a comprehensive picture of the U.S. education system can be pieced together each and every year, and institutions can be appropriately audited with data in hand.</p><p>When IPEDS is reformed into a system that forces universities to provide the data that we know they collect internally&#8212;from leaks like this, and because we can see it on their applications and in publications&#8212;, it will allow independent researchers, auditors, and other officials and interested parties to credibly speak out against violations of the law. Without this data being available, that won't be possible. We'll have to, instead, deal with decade-long court cases again, because the proof of discrimination is just that hard to force them to provide. If every university provides the data, each case is easier. Forcing them to provide <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250424183610/https://www.uaustin.org/admissions\">admissions formulae</a> would make this <em>even easier</em>.</p><p>Consider the Ivies. If we admitted just the most qualified students, it is impossible for them to admit as many Black students as they have. If we had data on every Black applicant, we could be completely sure of this and the DOJ could easily beat them in court. Consider the role of GPAs in admissions too. Having extensive data available allows us to better understand the meaning of GPAs at different high schools, so that admissions departments do not inappropriately inflate the r&#233;sum&#233;s of students who graduated from somewhere easy. </p><p>To wrap up, reform the data collection mechanisms and your case makes itself. Once it's possible to know discrimination is taking place, it will be known, because parents and interest groups will go and use the data. The universities will become easily punishable and no doubt, in short order, punished. Because the NIH, NSF, DOE, and other agencies are being turned over to the same regime that can compel the NCES to collect more data through IPEDS, the punishments can be extreme. Discriminate? Maybe you lose funding for all your researchers or all subsidized student loans.</p><p>This move would pave the way for America's institutions of higher learning to stop promoting the unqualified into America's elite journalistic, scientific, and governmental institutions through racially discriminatory admissions, and to instead <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-end-of-credentialism\">promote excellence once again</a>.</p><div><hr></div><p>I&#8217;ll leave it to the hacker to decide how they want to release the data to the public and will update here accordingly.</p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I added this footnote a few hours after I uploaded the article. It clarifies something explicitly that I thought was clear, but people evidently are not getting:</p><p><em>Test-optional policies allow universities to mask discrimination</em>.</p><p>I&#8217;ve noted here that we can get around this if we have enough data, but usually, we don&#8217;t, so we get stuck. Masking discrimination is the real point of test-optional policies, far beyond all the <a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/bias-is-often-unpredictable\">objectively false bluster about fairness</a>. If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with how this works, go read <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/what-happens-when-you-use-a-biased\">here</a>, and also <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/bias-in-admissions-and-hiring\">here</a>, while you&#8217;re at it. No one who deals with this topic is unaware of this problem, and that includes members of the current Trump administration. In the Department of Education&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf\">February 14 </a><em><a href=\"https://archive.md/iNNIM\">Dear Colleague</a></em><a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/media/document/dear-colleague-letter-sffa-v-harvard-109506.pdf\"> letter</a>, they wrote:</p><blockquote><p>Relying on non-racial information as a proxy for race, and making decisions based on that information, violates the law. That is true whether the proxies are used to grant preferences on an individual basis or a systematic one. <strong>It would, for instance, be unlawful for an educational institution to eliminate standardized testing to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity. </strong>[Emphasis mine]</p></blockquote><p>To be more explicit than that letter, the administration is saying that they&#8217;re aware of this strategy. They are aware that test-optionality is abusable, as it makes it harder to check whether other factors are being considered as proxies for race or some other desired demographic characteristic. The lack of an objective, unbiased baseline&#8212;test scores&#8212;makes it harder to grade the trustworthiness of everything else.</p><p>Consider <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/141977318/how-do-different-criteria-become-biased\">the situation with high school quality and censoring class ranks</a>. In that case, higher-ranking high schools censor class ranks, as they aim to provide their students with inflated GPAs that cannot be understood in terms of position in the class. If a person with a 1300 SAT score has a 4.0 and they&#8217;re at the 50th percentile for GPA, that GPA obviously means something different from the one held by a person with a 1300 SAT score and a 3.89 GPA, but who&#8217;s also the valedictorian of their school.</p><p>In short, what I am saying is that test-optionality is a tool for obfuscating discrimination because it removes objective anchors for student quality evaluation. Without said anchors, those interested in detecting and eliminating discrimination are adrift. When the statistics available to researchers concern post-admission data, the issue is compounded by the added range restriction (which is worse at more elite institutions). Together, these factors can make it seem like nothing is amiss. That&#8217;s why we need all the data to be made available, to simulate counterfactual scenarios. Thankfully, with this leak, we can see that plausible counterfactual admissions offer scenarios are inconsistent with what&#8217;s observed in practice.</p><p>To show just one example, I&#8217;ll provide the demographics that would be achieved by just going down the list in terms of SAT and re-scaled ACT scores, noting again that this sample only includes people who submitted scores and some people submitted both types. Going test-only would lead to:</p><ul><li><p>Whites: ~36% &#8594; just above 24%</p></li><li><p>Asians: ~48% &#8594; ~72%</p></li><li><p>Hispanics: ~9% &#8594; &lt;3%</p></li><li><p>Blacks: ~8% &#8594; &lt;2%</p></li></ul><p>In the real world, high-performing Black students will tend to have a much greater number of offers to attend elsewhere, making them less likely to go to Columbia relative to somewhere more prestigious or remunerative. The opposite will be true for White and then, even more extremely, for Asian students, as they are subject to discrimination and they are less likely to qualify for free applications. Therefore, if we were to account for realistic alternative options based on this stylized fact, it&#8217;s likely that the numbers would be even more slanted, with resultingly smaller Black and Hispanic classes. With various norming strategies applied to different criteria like GPAs, we get a similar picture: the results are almost-certainly not consistent with meritocratic admissions, and they fit better with a scenario where there&#8217;s substantial discrimination. If you throw in all plausible &#8216;merit-based&#8217; criteria, the picture would end up being a more muted version of the test score-only scenario, as was shown to be the case for Harvard during <em>SFFA v. Harvard.</em></p><p>This is as inescapable a conclusion as it was during <em>SFFA v. Harvard</em>, and I am hopeful that the Department of Justice will accept my standing offer to provide them with all of Columbia&#8217;s admissions data so that they can make this reality widely known in the course of formal legal actions against the university.</p></div></div>",

Here’s a summary in four words: they did not comply.\n\nFirstly, Columbia remains test-optional. 1 Students are not required to submit test scores, so, as at other schools, less-qualified admits tend to not provide scores. Those who do not provide their scores tend to perform like students who have fairly low scores, earning lower GPAs, flunking out at higher rates, switching to easier majors more readily, and so on.\nWho provides scores more and less often at Columbia? Submissions are shockingly rare, but ordered how you might expect if you’re familiar with educational achievement gaps. Asians submitted test scores more often than Whites, who submitted them more often than Hispanics, who submitted them much more often than Blacks.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis needs to be kept in mind to understand subsequent test score comparisons. The fact that certain groups submit test scores less often makes it so their scores are inflated relative to those who submit their scores more often. The fact that so few submit scores makes it difficult to create an academics-based admissions model, making it harder to determine how Columbia might have biased its admissions process. With that in mind, let’s see SAT scores for admits and students who Columbia didn’t accept:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThese results can be contrasted with the results from NYU in an interesting way. At NYU, non-admitted White and Asian students performed marginally and substantially better than Hispanic and Black admitted students, respectively. This could be due to differences in discrimination by the admissions departments, or to other factors like NYU not being the first choice for high-performing Hispanic and Black students as often, and high-performing Whites and Asians having fewer options. Since Columbia is an Ivy League university with a great deal more cachet than NYU, it’s likely that it’s the first choice for more people, so they’re more likely to attract elite students and to leave behind narrower test scores gaps post-selection, and that effect couples with test-optionality biasing Black and Hispanic scores upward.\nWith these factors in mind, these results—though less dramatic at a glance than NYU’s—are just as indicting. If we throw in ACT results, the fact that Columbia must be racially discriminating becomes even clearer: rejected Asian students substantially outscore admitted Blacks.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nWith more common criteria, the picture becomes much more like NYU’s, with Columbia clearly rejecting more qualified Whites and Asians than the Hispanics and Blacks they choose to admit. That means White and Asian students tend to have better GPAs, more extracurriculars, and—quite likely—better personalities and higher levels of other achievements, as we saw in the SFFA v. Harvard case. Virtually every qualification favors White and Asian students, and yet they’re still admitted less, at a level not explicable by things like legacy status, athletics and faculty relationships, and so on.\nIn other words, Columbia is clearly discriminating. When you try to predict admissions from test scores or GPAs, or a combination thereof, you consistently see that Asian students are underadmitted relative to those academic qualifications. This race interaction effect is large and significant regardless of how you permute the models, and it always indicates that, at the same level of legitimate qualifications, Blacks are more likely to be admitted than Hispanics, who are more likely to be admitted than Whites, who are more likely to be admitted than Asians.\nIf race is not considered in admissions and there aren’t major compensatory factors afoot—which has never been the case on investigation—then the model coefficients should not be this way. We know from this data that the gaps shown above should be smaller if offers were made to everyone in order of their qualifications without consideration of race. Race coefficients should all be nonsignificant and small; admissions should be like going down a list in order of academic qualifications and ignoring race, leaving behind no race effect. And yet, we got a race effect.\nColumbia is still discriminating, and their attempt to suggest otherwise by discriminating somewhat less is just an attempt to cover their behinds.\n\nForce Self-Incrimination\nUniversity after university has only feigned compliance with the SFFA v. Harvard ruling. At best, their demographics change a little bit in the expected direction for people who really are complying, and they seem to expect that to sate the public. But it should not, because they’re just reducing the magnitude of discrimination, while continuing to engage in it, and that’s not good enough. SFFA v. Harvard said to stop discriminating, full-stop.\nSo, how do we stop universities from continuing to violate the law like NYU and Columbia have been doing? Through gathering and releasing more data. The simplest solution to this whole issue is IPEDS Reform.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nIPEDS is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the primary postsecondary education data collection program in the U.S. It’s maintained by the National Center for Education Statistics, and it contains a wealth of data, but it could contain a lot more. Right now, anyone can go access IPEDS and obtain information on student test scores and demographics for different universities alongside a bundle of other interesting pieces of information. But it’s not enough. As noted by the primary researcher in the SFFA case, Peter Arcidiacono:\n\nThe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides information on total applications, admissions, and enrollment for all institutions that participate in federal student aid programs, but does not disaggregate the data by race or SAT score. A simple change in the data collection practices would generate a clearer picture of the role race plays in the admissions process at American colleges and universities, as well as help high school students make more informed decisions about where to apply to college.\nThe President can force IPEDS to enforce data collection standards that will make it unambiguous whether universities like Harvard, NYU, and Columbia are acting in violation of the law. They can go much deeper than merely providing race and sex breakouts, too. Universities should be forced to provide extensive, ideally individual-level data, both for applicants and for attendees, so that a comprehensive picture of the U.S. education system can be pieced together each and every year, and institutions can be appropriately audited with data in hand.\nWhen IPEDS is reformed into a system that forces universities to provide the data that we know they collect internally—from leaks like this, and because we can see it on their applications and in publications—, it will allow independent researchers, auditors, and other officials and interested parties to credibly speak out against violations of the law. Without this data being available, that won't be possible. We'll have to, instead, deal with decade-long court cases again, because the proof of discrimination is just that hard to force them to provide. If every university provides the data, each case is easier. Forcing them to provide admissions formulae would make this even easier.\nConsider the Ivies. If we admitted just the most qualified students, it is impossible for them to admit as many Black students as they have. If we had data on every Black applicant, we could be completely sure of this and the DOJ could easily beat them in court. Consider the role of GPAs in admissions too. Having extensive data available allows us to better understand the meaning of GPAs at different high schools, so that admissions departments do not inappropriately inflate the résumés of students who graduated from somewhere easy.\nTo wrap up, reform the data collection mechanisms and your case makes itself. Once it's possible to know discrimination is taking place, it will be known, because parents and interest groups will go and use the data. The universities will become easily punishable and no doubt, in short order, punished. Because the NIH, NSF, DOE, and other agencies are being turned over to the same regime that can compel the NCES to collect more data through IPEDS, the punishments can be extreme. Discriminate? Maybe you lose funding for all your researchers or all subsidized student loans.\nThis move would pave the way for America's institutions of higher learning to stop promoting the unqualified into America's elite journalistic, scientific, and governmental institutions through racially discriminatory admissions, and to instead promote excellence once again.\n\nI’ll leave it to the hacker to decide how they want to release the data to the public and will update here accordingly.\n1\n\nI added this footnote a few hours after I uploaded the article. It clarifies something explicitly that I thought was clear, but people evidently are not getting:\nTest-optional policies allow universities to mask discrimination.\nI’ve noted here that we can get around this if we have enough data, but usually, we don’t, so we get stuck. Masking discrimination is the real point of test-optional policies, far beyond all the objectively false bluster about fairness. If you’re unfamiliar with how this works, go read here, and also here, while you’re at it. No one who deals with this topic is unaware of this problem, and that includes members of the current Trump administration. In the Department of Education’s February 14 Dear Colleague letter, they wrote:\n\nRelying on non-racial information as a proxy for race, and making decisions based on that information, violates the law. That is true whether the proxies are used to grant preferences on an individual basis or a systematic one. It would, for instance, be unlawful for an educational institution to eliminate standardized testing to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity.[Emphasis mine]\nTo be more explicit than that letter, the administration is saying that they’re aware of this strategy. They are aware that test-optionality is abusable, as it makes it harder to check whether other factors are being considered as proxies for race or some other desired demographic characteristic. The lack of an objective, unbiased baseline—test scores—makes it harder to grade the trustworthiness of everything else.\nConsider the situation with high school quality and censoring class ranks. In that case, higher-ranking high schools censor class ranks, as they aim to provide their students with inflated GPAs that cannot be understood in terms of position in the class. If a person with a 1300 SAT score has a 4.0 and they’re at the 50th percentile for GPA, that GPA obviously means something different from the one held by a person with a 1300 SAT score and a 3.89 GPA, but who’s also the valedictorian of their school.\nIn short, what I am saying is that test-optionality is a tool for obfuscating discrimination because it removes objective anchors for student quality evaluation. Without said anchors, those interested in detecting and eliminating discrimination are adrift. When the statistics available to researchers concern post-admission data, the issue is compounded by the added range restriction (which is worse at more elite institutions). Together, these factors can make it seem like nothing is amiss. That’s why we need all the data to be made available, to simulate counterfactual scenarios. Thankfully, with this leak, we can see that plausible counterfactual admissions offer scenarios are inconsistent with what’s observed in practice.\nTo show just one example, I’ll provide the demographics that would be achieved by just going down the list in terms of SAT and re-scaled ACT scores, noting again that this sample only includes people who submitted scores and some people submitted both types. Going test-only would lead to:\n\nWhites: ~36% → just above 24%\n\nAsians: ~48% → ~72%\n\nHispanics: ~9% → <3%\n\nBlacks: ~8% → <2%\nIn the real world, high-performing Black students will tend to have a much greater number of offers to attend elsewhere, making them less likely to go to Columbia relative to somewhere more prestigious or remunerative. The opposite will be true for White and then, even more extremely, for Asian students, as they are subject to discrimination and they are less likely to qualify for free applications. Therefore, if we were to account for realistic alternative options based on this stylized fact, it’s likely that the numbers would be even more slanted, with resultingly smaller Black and Hispanic classes. With various norming strategies applied to different criteria like GPAs, we get a similar picture: the results are almost-certainly not consistent with meritocratic admissions, and they fit better with a scenario where there’s substantial discrimination. If you throw in all plausible ‘merit-based’ criteria, the picture would end up being a more muted version of the test score-only scenario, as was shown to be the case for Harvard during SFFA v. Harvard.\nThis is as inescapable a conclusion as it was during SFFA v. Harvard, and I am hopeful that the Department of Justice will accept my standing offer to provide them with all of Columbia’s admissions data so that they can make this reality widely known in the course of formal legal actions against the university.",

They don&#8217;t like that they allow people to &#8216;cheat&#8217; their way to weight loss, that the drugs make it &#8216;too easy&#8217; to lose weight. The ideas that people can inject a simple fix to their problems or that a drug can be unambiguously good just doesn&#8217;t sit well with them, so they invent and latch on to bad reasons to dislike GLP-1RAs. They make claims like:</p><ul><li><p>GLP-1RAs don&#8217;t work because you have to keep on them, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/the-worst-argument-against-ozempic\">just like how you have to keep exercising and dieting to maintain weight loss normally</a>.</p></li><li><p>GLP-1RAs cause thyroid cancer, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1901434539588649348\">even though that association doesn&#8217;t seem to be supported</a>.</p></li><li><p>GLP-1RAs are making people blind on a staggering scale, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1917703456921641115\">even though that&#8217;s implausible and seemingly untrue</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Not one of the numerous alleged, major downsides of GLP-1RAs has held up to scrutiny so far, and it&#8217;s not clear why they would when the trial results so clearly show tolerability, that the drugs have been in use for long enough and with enough prescriptions for major downsides to be apparent, and that the mechanisms behind the drug are so benign and commonplace. <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1897502827448033553\">The mechanism in question is neural GLP-1 agonism</a>, and we know that operations that create relatively high levels of endogenous GLP-1 production&#8212;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11695-017-2913-1\">like Roux-En-Y gastric bypass</a>&#8212;are safe, meaning that there&#8217;s a large amount of excellent, long-term data to reassure us that GLP-1RAs should be too.</p><p>One popular argument against GLP-1RAs is that they lead to excessively high muscle mass loss compared to standard, non-pharmacological weight loss. Some people have even taken this so far as to claim that GLP-1RAs lead to more muscle than fat loss. Both points are difficult to credibly support, but there is at least <em>something </em>intuitively sensible about the first claim even if a pharmacological mechanism is absent. A pretty apparent fact is that the people who use GLP-1RAs tend to be lazier: they tend to exercise less and eat worse than people losing weight the traditional, non-drug assisted way. That could have predictable consequences for the ratio of muscle to fat loss, or so the logic goes.</p><p>Whether the logic actually holds is another matter.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #1: Do People Lose More Muscle Than Fat?</h3><p>The claim here is that people cut weight with GLP-1RAs primarily by losing muscle rather than fat, thus worsening body composition after drug-assisted weight loss. This position is not supported empirically. In each trial, the opposite is true: people lose more fat than muscle, improving their body composition as they lose weight.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183\">a major trial of Semaglutide</a>, the treatment group lost an average of 8.36 kilograms of fat and 5.26 kilograms of lean body mass. The placebo group lost an average of 1.37 kilograms of fat and 1.83 kilograms of lean body mass. The relative contributions of fat to weight loss were 61.4% for the GLP-1RA group and 42.8% for the group losing weight with a placebo.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">a major trial of Tirzepatide</a>, the treatment group lost 33.9% of their total fat mass and 10.9% of their lean mass, versus 8.2% and 2.6% for the placebo group. Both outcomes were favorable, but the treated participants fared better: &#8220;The ratio of total fat mass to total lean mass decreased more with tirzepatide (from 0.93 at baseline to 0.70 at week 72) than with placebo (from 0.95 to 0.88).&#8221; Similarly, in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.23939\">a relatively short trial of Retatrutide</a> (Poster-474), participants saw considerable weight loss which was two-thirds fat and one-third lean.</p><p><a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932\">Similar</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587%2824%2900272-9/abstract\">ratios are</a> <a href=\"https://www.easd.org/media-centre/home.html#!resources/tirzepatide-achieves-significant-weight-loss-without-adverse-effects-on-muscle-composition-surpass-3-mri-d33f2a13-d83e-4112-8763-621e82d3e128\">observed in</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-019-05065-8\">different</a> <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/12/2414\">trials</a> and these results are <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728\">entirely typical across the literature</a>. The only net unfavorable compositional result came from <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2009.01158.x\">a trial of a less effective, daily-dosed older generation of GLP-1RA drug</a>, Liraglutide. That failure was a narrow one (60% lean mass loss) in a very low-power substudy which also produced the nonsensical result&#8212;which failed to replicate&#8212;that a higher dose led to less weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #2: Is the Muscle Loss Ratio Unusually High?</h3><p>The claim here is that GLP-1RAs cause more muscle loss than would be expected given the same amount of weight loss done without pharmacological assistance, such as through using diet, exercise, or bariatric surgery. A simple way to answer this is to plot body weight loss versus lean body mass loss across different intervention regimes conducted on similar populations. That was recently done in <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15728\">a paper in the journal </a><em><a

diet, GLP-1RAs, and bariatric surgery produce clinically comparable and statistically indistinguishable reductions in lean body mass. This fact has been pointed out in GLP-1RA trials; <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">for example</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Participants treated with tirzepatide had a percent reduction in fat mass approximately three times greater than the reduction in lean mass, resulting in an overall improvement in body composition. <strong>The ratio of fat-mass loss to lean-mass loss was similar to that reported with <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/oby.21577\">lifestyle-based and surgical treatments for obesity</a>.</strong></p></blockquote><p>But this does not actually answer the claim because it&#8217;s about <em>muscle loss</em>. Lean mass measurements are a great proxy for muscle, but lean mass is not just muscle, as it also includes water, bone, and other tissues, in addition to fat infiltration.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> There is, however, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00027-0/fulltext\">one brand-new study</a> that does provide an answer using MRI-based measurements from the SURPASS-3 trial of Tirzepatide and from the U.K. Biobank.</p><p>The study looked at individuals in the large and popular U.K. Biobank cohort and assessed the relationship between non-pharmacological weight loss and muscle loss so that &#8216;normal&#8217; weight loss could be compared to the weight loss in a matched cohort that lost weight using GLP-1RAs.

To get to that answer, the amount of muscular volume lost at a given amount of weight loss has to be compared directly. The answer from that analysis was favorable: those on Tirzepatide lost 0.04 liters more muscular volume at the same level of weight loss, which is both clinically unimportant and was statistically nonsignificant (<em>p</em> = 0.22).</p><div><hr></div><h3>Claim #3: Do GLP-1RAs Produce Muscular Dysfunction?</h3><p>We now know that GLP-1RAs produce more fat loss than muscle loss and that the muscle loss from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is comparable to the muscle loss that comes with lifestyle-based weight loss and from surgery. But now we have to ask: do GLP-1RAs make people unusually weak? It&#8217;s one thing to maintain muscular volume, but it may be quite another to maintain muscular quality.</p><p>There are considerable reasons to disbelieve the claim that muscular dysfunction follows from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss. The evidence above indicated that muscular volume is maintained, and that alone is <em>very strong</em> evidence that this belief is unfounded, but it is not itself dispositive. In the comparison between Tirzepatide-based weight loss and weight loss in the U.K. Biobank, additional evidence came in the form of observations about <em>fat infiltration</em>.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg\" width=\"900\" height=\"900\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\" title=\"Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CHNN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b795ee0-48ec-493b-ad8b-f39f5512ab44_900x900.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Aldona Griskeviciene/Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure></div><p>Fat infiltration, or myosteatosis, refers to the condition where fat gets in and between muscle fibers. This happens to everyone to varying extents, and it&#8217;s particularly marked with age. Moreover, it is <a href=\"https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-023-02641-5\">strongly related</a> to reduced strength, and increases in it seem to cause frailty and physical weakness. More importantly, reductions are accompanied by improved physical functioning. There&#8217;s high-quality documentation of this fact based on <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/3/711/5289722\">individuals who have received Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses</a>. Their operation did cause weight loss (-30%), did cause fat loss (-48%), and did cause both lean mass loss (-13%) and reductions in absolute strength (-9%). However, relative strength increased by a much more substantial margin (+32%), and this improvement came with significant improvements in physical performance measures, like improved walking speed and heightened physical activity levels.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>This is what is expected with <em>any </em>intentional weight loss efforts aimed at improving body composition and weight level. That should not come as a surprise since fat genuinely impedes muscular function. Relatedly, in individuals experiencing disease-related wasting and <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/hep/fulltext/2023/10001/the_liver_meeting__boston,_massachusetts_nov.1.aspx#JCL2194\">among those with metabolic disorders</a>, fat infiltration tends to <em>increase </em>as weight declines, suggesting our eyes aren&#8217;t playing tricks on us and that those individuals are experiencing unhealthy weight loss.</p><p>Here&#8217;s the kicker: fat infiltration falls with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss, as it does with non-pharmacological weight loss. This finding holds both compared to a control drug (shown below) and compared to the weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample (-0.42pp, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001).<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> Therefore, we should have it as our prior that this sort of weight loss is not unlikely to <em>improve </em>rather than <em>degrade </em>muscular function, given everything else we know.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\"

by noting, for example, that <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.12932\">there is no apparent excess reduction in metabolism after taking GLP-1RAs</a>, indicating that the weight loss is metabolically healthful. Or, to take things to their logical conclusion, we could simply look at what participants in trials report about their physical functioning. That means <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2206038\">reporting significantly</a> <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183\">fewer physical limitations</a> in daily life and <a href=\"https://dom-pubs.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/doi/10.1111/dom.15620\">otherwise improved physical functioning and even quality of life</a>.</p><p>One could reasonably say that participants are overhyping the benefits to quality of life or physical functioning, but given all the other evidence, that argument rests on unsolid ground and it would be more reasonable to claim that the changes are real and correctly being observed by patients. This is even more strongly supported by observations regarding health, like those based on the reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in lung function, and even based on reported social improvements. Social improvements, I feel, should be viewed as indications of health improvements, since if people are socializing more, are going out more, and are off their couch in general, they&#8217;re probably doing other things that are more healthful and which were more difficult when they were fatter.</p><p>All lines of evidence point to GLP-1RAs <em>improving </em>rather than worsening muscle quality and physical functioning. Though there is reason to be concerned about individuals who are at-risk for sarcopenia using the drugs when they should not, that is not an indictment of GLP-1RAs in general use or mechanistically.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> It is, instead, a point of caution doctors should keep in mind when making the choice to prescribe these drugs.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Strong Priors: Weight Loss is Therapeutic</h3><p>On the basis of the existing evidence, we can confidently state this: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to be unique except in as much as GLP-1RA users are self-selected. With this statement of the evidence in mind, the weight loss that people are undergoing using GLP-1RAs should be regarded as health-promoting as much as weight loss in general is.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>Concerns about <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.067676\">induced frailty</a> and so many other alleged side effects of GLP-1RAs run counter to the evidence and routinely lack any semblance of biological plausibility or any sort of statistical credibility. If I had to bet, that will remain true and scientifically unsupported concerns will continue to dominate the GLP-1 debate.</p><div><hr></div><h3>June 18th 2025 Update: The COURAGE and EMBRAZE Trials</h3><p>Several companies are developing products to reduce the amount of lean mass loss that occurs during GLP1-RA-induced weight loss. While this effort does not seem justified based on the existence of excess GLP-1-RA-related lean mass loss, it&#8217;s still justified for the reason that it&#8217;s generally good to lose less lean mass. Furthermore, if people fear excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RAs, regardless of that fear&#8217;s reality, a company might be able to profitably sell something to address that concern, which could be good for its bottom line. It&#8217;s hard to blame companies for exploiting this fear.</p><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250607183759/https://newsroom.regeneron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/interim-results-ongoing-phase-2-courage-trial-confirm-potential\">Regeneron</a> (COURAGE) and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250618221625/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250618254394/en/Scholar-Rock-Reports-Positive-Phase-2-EMBRAZE-Trial-Results-Demonstrating-Statistically-Significant-Preservation-of-Lean-Mass-with-Apitegromab-During-Tirzepatide-Induced-Weight-Loss\">Scholar Rock</a> (EMBRAZE) recently released preliminary phase II trial results showing the success of their myostatin inhibition-based approaches.

These loss ratios seem to be fine and at a level where weight loss is certainly healthful, especially for individuals suffering from serious obesity. With that said, semaglutide may be statistically&#8212;but not typically clinically&#8212;worse than tirzepatide across the published literature, and perhaps low-dose myostatin inhibitors could make both superior to most other weight loss approaches, if not in terms of the total lean mass loss ratio itself, then in terms of that <em>in combination</em> with the feasibility of treatment.</p><p>Though I did not illustrate it, Regeneron&#8217;s high-dose trevogrumab and garetosmab therapy was superior in terms of lean mass loss to almost everything on this chart and it was superior to everything on this chart feasibility- and absolute loss in a given amount of time-wise, but garetosmab tolerability left something to be desired.</p><p>The results of the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials are encouraging regardless of the validity or lack thereof of worries over excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3>June 21st 2025 Update: A Systematic Review of GLP-1RAs</h3><p>There&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002604952400341X\">a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on GLP-1RA effects on body composition</a> and its results are worth mentioning.</p><p>Across twenty-two randomized controlled trials of varying lengths, drugs, and dosages, GLP-1RAs were associated with 3.55 kilograms of lost weight, 2.95 kilograms of lost fat mass, and 0.86 kilograms of lost lean mass. You might notice that 2.95 + 0.86 = 3.81, not 3.55, so something is amiss. You&#8217;d be right: all the estimates aren&#8217;t matched; not every study reported each outcome, so there&#8217;s a bit of noisiness. But, using these numbers, we can get a plausible range of values for the lean mass percentage. If we use the fat mass loss as a percentage of the overall body weight loss, GLP-1RAs are associated with 16.9% lean mass loss, and if we use the lean mass loss, the number is 24.2%, and if we reason from the sum of the lean and fat mass loss numbers, the lean percentage is 22.6%. Per the authors, lean mass loss generally comprised &#8220;approximately 25% of the total weight loss&#8221;, consistent with the Quarter FFM Rule.</p><p>If we look specifically at the results for top-line GLP-1RAs in use today, we see that they had reports on 15 mg weekly tirzepatide, 1 mg weekly semaglutide, and 14 mg daily oral semaglutide, in addition to reported on liraglutide given at dosages of 1.8 or 3.0 mg. Comparing the lean mass percentages for these different drugs is possible, and I&#8217;ve added a chart of this in this footnote<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a>, but I want to advise that I don&#8217;t think simply comparing fat loss percentages without contextualization is the right approach. The reason is, different trials led to different total weight loss, and total weight loss moderates the extent of lean mass loss. If you lose enough weight, you will eventually lose both more and a higher percentage of lean mass. It&#8217;s unclear if this happens in the range seen in these studies. Indeed, one could easily argue the opposite, but for low amounts of lost weight, because the first weight to go is lean mass in the form of water weight. So, we&#8217;ll isolate our view to the endpoints of trials with significant and positive weight loss.</p><p>As with the overall results, there is some imprecision due to unmatched estimates, so keep that in mind. Tirzepatide (15 mg/week) led to 10.81 kilograms of lost weight, of which 8.75 were fat and 1.84 were lean. Taking the lean percentage from the sum, we get 17.4%, or from the total based on fat mass lost, we get 19.1% versus 17.0% reasoning from fat and lean mass losses, respectively. For semaglutide (1mg/week), there were 6.24 kilograms of total weight lost, of which 4.37 were fat and 1.22 were lean. The same numbers were 16.4%, 30%, and 19.6%. For oral semaglutide, total losses were 2.60 kilograms, with 2 kilograms of fat and 0.60 lean, for 23.1% lean mass losses.</p><p>If we take all the aggregated treatment effects with weight loss in this review, we can assess the slopes for fat and lean mass loss versus total weight lost straightforwardly. By contrasting these slopes, we can gather an expectation about lean mass loss as weight loss grows.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\"

tirzepatide datapoint or the estimates with nonsignificant total losses. Even removing all of them doesn&#8217;t really change the picture. The authors of the paper used the individual study point estimates when they did a meta-regression similar to this, and they found slopes of &#946; = 0.7 and 0.09 for fat and lean mass loss, respectively. Their estimates were even more favorable towards GLP-1RAs than the estimates I made from the aggregated numbers. In both cases, linearity seemed tenable enough.</p><p>This review provided substantial and clear evidence: <em>GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to produce meaningfully different compositional effects than typical weight loss, as represented by the Quarter FFM Rule.</em></p><div><hr></div><h3>June 23rd Update: The Age of Mass-Market Monoclonals?</h3><p>Today, Eli Lilly gave an incredible presentation at the ADA 2025 meeting. They showed the results of treating people with their activin type-II receptor inhibitor, bimagrumab, without and without the addition of semaglutide.

Let&#8217;s go left-to-right:</p><ul><li><p>Bimagrumab on its own led to weight reductions, as seen in <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774903\">an earlier phase II trial</a>.</p><ul><li><p>These reductions were entirely due to the loss of fat.</p></li><li><p>Meaning, muscle was entirely preserved in bimagrumab-only treatment.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Semaglutide alone led to a proportion of fat loss not distinguishable from the Quarter FFM Rule. It did not lead to excess lean mass loss.</p></li><li><p>Combination bimagrumab and semaglutide led to compositional improvements.</p><ul><li><p>Proportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in typical weight loss.</p></li><li><p>Proportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in weight loss with good control over exercise and diet.</p></li><li><p>The pace of weight loss was accelerated over semaglutide-based expectations.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The dosage of bimagrumab (10mg/kg in low-dose arms or 30mg/kg in high-dose arms) was unrelated to the extent of lean mass preservation, only to weight loss.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a></p><ul><li><p>This fits with, but, at this dosage, fails to confirm the theory that much lower dosages could still deliver substantially improved lean mass preservation.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Reassuringly, bimagrumab did not seem to produce &#8216;useless&#8217; muscle, as it was at least strength-preserving, and potentially strength-enhancing.</p><ul><li><p>Physical function was improved.</p></li><li><p>Grip strength was sustained or improved.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Leptin levels fell by more and adiponectin levels increased by more among the bimagrumab users.</p></li><li><p>Proxied inflammation levels fell more with bimagrumab than with semaglutide alone.</p></li></ul><p>Now, onto the bad parts.</p><p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a statistical caveat here: Eli Lilly primarily presented TOT instead of ITT estimates. These are more favorable to efficacy judgments and they make comparisons with other plots in different studies more difficult. Moreover, the difference may be particularly meaningful in this case, because high-dose monoclonal antibody treatments often come with a lot of side effects. This was no exception, although it should be noted that none of the side effects were &#8220;serious&#8221;, meaning becoming life-threatening.</p><p>The side effects that were above and beyond the typical side effects seen with semaglutide were:</p><ul><li><p>Muscle spasms (~50-75% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~6% for placebo and ~9-13% for semaglutide)</p></li><li><p>Acne (~34-55% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~4% for placebo and 9-11% for semaglutide)</p></li><li><p>Lipid profiles showed an atherogenic shift.</p><ul><li><p>HDL levels decreased transiently in all weight loss groups, but they decreased more for bimagrumab users, and they only returned to baseline by 48 weeks for them, whereas they returned to baseline by 24 weeks for semaglutide users.</p><ul><li><p>For all treatment groups, HDL levels increased above baseline to a comparable degree after the trial was through, so this is not an ongoing concern.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>LDL levels experienced a sustained roughly 10% decline for the semaglutide-only groups, but they experienced a sizable increase for the bimagrumab groups, ranging between 15% for the highest-dose group to 30% for the high-dose bimagrumab-alone group.</p><ul><li><p>The levels in the high-dose groups that took semaglutide moved back to baseline by 24 weeks after treatment.</p></li><li><p>Levels for the high-dose bimagrumab-only group dropped down to +18% by 24 weeks after treatment, and in both of the bimagrumab groups using low-dose semaglutide, they seemed to not move at all post-treatment, sticking around at ~13-16% above baseline.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>All the caveats noted, this antibody treatment clearly has major potential and possible mass market appeal.</p><p>Acne is generally mild and manageable, and muscle spasms are also generally mild, and they&#8217;re usually transient. Both are also side effects seen with anabolic steroid usage, and you can just ask bodybuilders how they deal with those issues: <em>they&#8217;ll usually say they&#8217;re fine, manageable, and worthwhile. </em>(Imagine how much this will help bodybuilders with cut and bulk cycles!) Since steroid users tend to be younger and hardier, they might not even care about the muscle spasms at all, but these could be a bigger issue for the general population and especially for the elderly. The lipid issue is also something seen with anabolic steroid usage, and it is also manageable, but definitely more pesky. The atherogenic effect of LDL accumulates with time, so therapy with bimagrumab might benefit from statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or simply not going on for a very long time. Bimagrumab definitely benefits from being paired with semaglutide to control the atherogenic risk, and it may also benefit if there are bimagrumab-related <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.11.659035v1\">glycemic control issues</a> down the line. This atherogenic issue might present an issue for the people who want to use bimagrumab to <em>gain </em>muscle, but they are neither here nor there. If there are other side effects like alopecia, those have not come up to my knowledge, and they will need to be investigated. That sort of thing may be a phase IV issue.</p><p>In the study&#8217;s high-dose bimagrumab and semaglutide arm, 94% of participants achieved at least a 30% reduction in fat mass, so given you can very likely just come off to get rid of the acne and muscle spasm side effects while sustaining your weight well due to the preserved muscle mass, a huge number of customers will find this to be worthwhile. When this moves to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40262-022-01189-0\">a subcutaneous dosage factor</a> and the price drops, I am certain we&#8217;ll see lots of people clamoring to use this product and products like it. Eli Lilly is also running a trial with tirzepatide instead of semaglutide; it&#8217;s likely that trial will see even smaller reductions in lean mass and even greater weight loss, with <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1936128617463136529\">fewer gastrointestinal side effects</a>.</p><p>Best of luck to Eli Lilly and to every other pharmaceutical company trying to make this a reality. What they&#8217;re doing here is nothing short of amazing. They are making weight loss an injectable, and making being&#8212;in terms of being muscular and low-fat&#8212;increasingly trivial. If companies like Eli Lilly, Regeneron, and Scholar Rock succeed, then Americans will become much more attractive, athletic, and healthy, fast.</p><p>I hope to see more work done in this area to alleviate the issue of lean mass loss with weight loss, even though this study and studies like it show that it&#8217;s not a problem that&#8217;s unique to or accentuated in GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>Will I Keep Updating This Post?</em></h3><p>There will be no more large edits unless something big happens. The evidence is clear enough and anyone still in denial about the fact that GLP-1RAs do not lend themselves to excess lean mass loss is fighting an uphill battle against mountains of evidence.</p><p>I will likely only be doing small edits below, largely by bullet point, as new results come along. I also may go back and edit the parts on Regeneron&#8217;s, Scholar Rock&#8217;s, and Eli Lilly&#8217;s results once the papers are published for the preliminary trial results I covered.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Short Updates</h3><ul><li><p><strong>June 24, 2025: </strong>A subscriber sent me <a href=\"https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/47/10/1718/154535/Incretin-Based-Weight-Loss-Pharmacotherapy-Can\">Locatelli et al.&#8217;s</a> article arguing that adding exercise to incretin-based therapies would help to reduce the extent of lean mass loss.<br><br>The data they cite overlaps considerably with what I cite here, so not much new on that front. The conclusions they reach are about benefits from exercise also valid, and if you scroll up to the weight loss method vs. compositional change chart I made, you can see evidence for it. As public health advice, their conclusions are not very useful, because <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/148945836/june-th-update-real-world-rebound-evidence\">motivating people is a major part of the issue with weight in the first place</a>. But there might be utility in telling people that exercise can offset lean mass loss, or that the lean mass loss ratio is broadly similar between GLP-1RA therapy and other forms of weight loss.</p></li></ul><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The most common means of measuring lean body mass is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA. When DXA is used, it &#8220;sees&#8221;:</p><ul><li><p>Bone mineral (minerals in bone)</p></li><li><p>Fat mass (soft-tissue pixels whose X-ray attenuation matches adipose tissue, like subcutaneous, visceral, or large seams of inter- and intra-muscular fat large enough to dominate a pixel)</p></li><li><p>Lean soft-tissue mass (everything else, including water, muscle fibers, organs, connective tissue, plus any fat or fibrous tissue interspersed within muscle but too fine-grained for DXA to resolve)</p></li></ul><p>DXA classifies each 1-5mm pixel into one of these categories based on the ratio of low- and high-energy X-ray attenuation. If a pixel contains mostly fat, it lands in the &#8220;fat&#8221; bin, but small droplets and marbling of fat inside a muscle fiber bundle typically share the pixel with far more water-rich tissue, so the algorithm tags the whole pixel as &#8220;lean&#8221;. This also applies to fibrous scar tissue and edema in that DXA cannot distinguish them from contractile muscle.</p><p>This is known in the literature using DXA.</p><ul><li><p>In studies using DXA in Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy (DMD), <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23072-5\">we see notes like</a>: &#8220;Accumulation of fibrous tissue in boys with DMD can also affect lean body mass measures because DXA does not differentiate between healthy muscle and fibrous tissue and, therefore, measures of functional muscle mass could be overestimated. As DMD progresses, the percentage of total muscle volume decreases as muscle is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. DXA does not differentiate fat infiltration from intermuscular or subcutaneous fat, and therefore cannot provide a completely accurate interpretation of fat distribution.

      "script_text": "This was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here. If you’re looking to acquire Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Retatrutide or other GLP-1RA drugs at an extremely low price of around $15-$40 per month, see this article.\n\nThere’s a loud minority online that hates the idea of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs (GLP-1RAs) like Ozempic and Tirzepatide. They don’t like that they allow people to ‘cheat’ their way to weight loss, that the drugs make it ‘too easy’ to lose weight. The ideas that people can inject a simple fix to their problems or that a drug can be unambiguously good just doesn’t sit well with them, so they invent and latch on to bad reasons to dislike GLP-1RAs. They make claims like:\n\nGLP-1RAs don’t work because you have to keep on them, just like how you have to keep exercising and dieting to maintain weight loss normally.\n\nGLP-1RAs cause thyroid cancer, even though that association doesn’t seem to be supported.\n\nGLP-1RAs are making people blind on a staggering scale, even though that’s implausible and seemingly untrue.\nNot one of the numerous alleged, major downsides of GLP-1RAs has held up to scrutiny so far, and it’s not clear why they would when the trial results so clearly show tolerability, that the drugs have been in use for long enough and with enough prescriptions for major downsides to be apparent, and that the mechanisms behind the drug are so benign and commonplace. The mechanism in question is neural GLP-1 agonism, and we know that operations that create relatively high levels of endogenous GLP-1 production— like Roux-En-Y gastric bypass —are safe, meaning that there’s a large amount of excellent, long-term data to reassure us that GLP-1RAs should be too.\nOne popular argument against GLP-1RAs is that they lead to excessively high muscle mass loss compared to standard, non-pharmacological weight loss. Some people have even taken this so far as to claim that GLP-1RAs lead to more muscle than fat loss. Both points are difficult to credibly support, but there is at least something intuitively sensible about the first claim even if a pharmacological mechanism is absent. A pretty apparent fact is that the people who use GLP-1RAs tend to be lazier: they tend to exercise less and eat worse than people losing weight the traditional, non-drug assisted way. That could have predictable consequences for the ratio of muscle to fat loss, or so the logic goes.\nWhether the logic actually holds is another matter.\n\nClaim #1: Do People Lose More Muscle Than Fat?\nThe claim here is that people cut weight with GLP-1RAs primarily by losing muscle rather than fat, thus worsening body composition after drug-assisted weight loss. This position is not supported empirically. In each trial, the opposite is true: people lose more fat than muscle, improving their body composition as they lose weight.\nIn a major trial of Semaglutide, the treatment group lost an average of 8.36 kilograms of fat and 5.26 kilograms of lean body mass. The placebo group lost an average of 1.37 kilograms of fat and 1.83 kilograms of lean body mass. The relative contributions of fat to weight loss were 61.4% for the GLP-1RA group and 42.8% for the group losing weight with a placebo.\nIn a major trial of Tirzepatide, the treatment group lost 33.9% of their total fat mass and 10.9% of their lean mass, versus 8.2% and 2.6% for the placebo group. Both outcomes were favorable, but the treated participants fared better: “The ratio of total fat mass to total lean mass decreased more with tirzepatide (from 0.93 at baseline to 0.70 at week 72) than with placebo (from 0.95 to 0.88).” Similarly, in a relatively short trial of Retatrutide(Poster-474), participants saw considerable weight loss which was two-thirds fat and one-third lean.\nSimilar ratios are observed in different trials and these results are entirely typical across the literature. The only net unfavorable compositional result came from a trial of a less effective, daily-dosed older generation of GLP-1RA drug, Liraglutide. That failure was a narrow one (60% lean mass loss) in a very low-power substudy which also produced the nonsensical result—which failed to replicate—that a higher dose led to less weight loss.\n\nClaim #2: Is the Muscle Loss Ratio Unusually High?\nThe claim here is that GLP-1RAs cause more muscle loss than would be expected given the same amount of weight loss done without pharmacological assistance, such as through using diet, exercise, or bariatric surgery. A simple way to answer this is to plot body weight loss versus lean body mass loss across different intervention regimes conducted on similar populations. That was recently done in a paper in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe data here contains considerable noise, but the picture is nevertheless clear: at similar levels of total body weight loss, diet, GLP-1RAs, and bariatric surgery produce clinically comparable and statistically indistinguishable reductions in lean body mass. This fact has been pointed out in GLP-1RA trials; for example:\n\nParticipants treated with tirzepatide had a percent reduction in fat mass approximately three times greater than the reduction in lean mass, resulting in an overall improvement in body composition. The ratio of fat-mass loss to lean-mass loss was similar to that reported with lifestyle-based and surgical treatments for obesity.\nBut this does not actually answer the claim because it’s about muscle loss. Lean mass measurements are a great proxy for muscle, but lean mass is not just muscle, as it also includes water, bone, and other tissues, in addition to fat infiltration. 1 There is, however, one brand-new study that does provide an answer using MRI-based measurements from the SURPASS-3 trial of Tirzepatide and from the U.K. Biobank.\nThe study looked at individuals in the large and popular U.K. Biobank cohort and assessed the relationship between non-pharmacological weight loss and muscle loss so that ‘normal’ weight loss could be compared to the weight loss in a matched cohort that lost weight using GLP-1RAs. The relationships in either cohort, as it turns out, were high and statistically indistinguishable:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThis, however, does not inform us enough alone about whether there was more or less muscle loss, as it could have been the case that the intercepts differed. To get to that answer, the amount of muscular volume lost at a given amount of weight loss has to be compared directly. The answer from that analysis was favorable: those on Tirzepatide lost 0.04 liters more muscular volume at the same level of weight loss, which is both clinically unimportant and was statistically nonsignificant ( p= 0.22).\n\nClaim #3: Do GLP-1RAs Produce Muscular Dysfunction?\nWe now know that GLP-1RAs produce more fat loss than muscle loss and that the muscle loss from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is comparable to the muscle loss that comes with lifestyle-based weight loss and from surgery. But now we have to ask: do GLP-1RAs make people unusually weak? It’s one thing to maintain muscular volume, but it may be quite another to maintain muscular quality.\nThere are considerable reasons to disbelieve the claim that muscular dysfunction follows from GLP-1RA-induced weight loss. The evidence above indicated that muscular volume is maintained, and that alone is very strong evidence that this belief is unfounded, but it is not itself dispositive. In the comparison between Tirzepatide-based weight loss and weight loss in the U.K. Biobank, additional evidence came in the form of observations about fat infiltration.\n\nImage: Co-existence of hepatosteatosis and skeletal muscle fat ...\n\n\n\nAldona Griskeviciene/Shutterstock.com\nFat infiltration, or myosteatosis, refers to the condition where fat gets in and between muscle fibers. This happens to everyone to varying extents, and it’s particularly marked with age. Moreover, it is strongly related to reduced strength, and increases in it seem to cause frailty and physical weakness. More importantly, reductions are accompanied by improved physical functioning. There’s high-quality documentation of this fact based on individuals who have received Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses. Their operation did cause weight loss (-30%), did cause fat loss (-48%), and did cause both lean mass loss (-13%) and reductions in absolute strength (-9%). However, relative strength increased by a much more substantial margin (+32%), and this improvement came with significant improvements in physical performance measures, like improved walking speed and heightened physical activity levels. 2\nThis is what is expected with any intentional weight loss efforts aimed at improving body composition and weight level. That should not come as a surprise since fat genuinely impedes muscular function. Relatedly, in individuals experiencing disease-related wasting and among those with metabolic disorders, fat infiltration tends to increase as weight declines, suggesting our eyes aren’t playing tricks on us and that those individuals are experiencing unhealthy weight loss.\nHere’s the kicker: fat infiltration falls with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss, as it does with non-pharmacological weight loss. This finding holds both compared to a control drug (shown below) and compared to the weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample (-0.42pp, p< 0.0001). 3 Therefore, we should have it as our prior that this sort of weight loss is not unlikely to improve rather than degrade muscular function, given everything else we know.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSattar et al. 2025, Figure 1A, 1-2\nWe can take this reasoning several steps further by noting, for example, that there is no apparent excess reduction in metabolism after taking GLP-1RAs, indicating that the weight loss is metabolically healthful. Or, to take things to their logical conclusion, we could simply look at what participants in trials report about their physical functioning. That means reporting significantly fewer physical limitations in daily life and otherwise improved physical functioning and even quality of life.\nOne could reasonably say that participants are overhyping the benefits to quality of life or physical functioning, but given all the other evidence, that argument rests on unsolid ground and it would be more reasonable to claim that the changes are real and correctly being observed by patients. This is even more strongly supported by observations regarding health, like those based on the reductions in cardiovascular risk factors, improvements in lung function, and even based on reported social improvements. Social improvements, I feel, should be viewed as indications of health improvements, since if people are socializing more, are going out more, and are off their couch in general, they’re probably doing other things that are more healthful and which were more difficult when they were fatter.\nAll lines of evidence point to GLP-1RAs improving rather than worsening muscle quality and physical functioning. Though there is reason to be concerned about individuals who are at-risk for sarcopenia using the drugs when they should not, that is not an indictment of GLP-1RAs in general use or mechanistically. 4 It is, instead, a point of caution doctors should keep in mind when making the choice to prescribe these drugs.\n\nStrong Priors: Weight Loss is Therapeutic\nOn the basis of the existing evidence, we can confidently state this: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to be unique except in as much as GLP-1RA users are self-selected. With this statement of the evidence in mind, the weight loss that people are undergoing using GLP-1RAs should be regarded as health-promoting as much as weight loss in general is. 5\nConcerns about induced frailty and so many other alleged side effects of GLP-1RAs run counter to the evidence and routinely lack any semblance of biological plausibility or any sort of statistical credibility. If I had to bet, that will remain true and scientifically unsupported concerns will continue to dominate the GLP-1 debate.\n\nJune 18th 2025 Update: The COURAGE and EMBRAZE Trials\nSeveral companies are developing products to reduce the amount of lean mass loss that occurs during GLP1-RA-induced weight loss. While this effort does not seem justified based on the existence of excess GLP-1-RA-related lean mass loss, it’s still justified for the reason that it’s generally good to lose less lean mass. Furthermore, if people fear excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RAs, regardless of that fear’s reality, a company might be able to profitably sell something to address that concern, which could be good for its bottom line. It’s hard to blame companies for exploiting this fear.\nRegeneron(COURAGE) and Scholar Rock(EMBRAZE) recently released preliminary phase II trial results showing the success of their myostatin inhibition-based approaches. Without inhibitors, those in Regeneron’s semaglutide weight loss group dropped 34.5% lean mass and those in Scholar Rock’s tirzepatide weight loss group saw 30.2% lean mass loss. These were, respectively, nonsignificantly better and worse than the major trials cited above. Inhibitors seemed to be tolerated well and they did reduce the percentages of weight loss that was lean. The fat-free mass loss percentages in these trials were not significantly different or clinically distinct from the traditional loss range given by the well-known “ Quarter Fat-Free Mass Rule ”. Given the relative laziness of these users compared to people undergoing normal weight loss, there seems to be basically nothing abnormal here, consistent with the results presented above.\nIf we throw together percentages of lean mass lost with ketogenic diet, the traditional fat-free mass loss rule (25%, 20-30%), the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials, rapid and slow “ successful ” weight loss, bariatric surgery, the Minnesota Semi-Starvation Experiment results from Keys’ The Biology of Human Starvation stratified by weeks 1-12 versus 12+ (see discussion here), as well as typical values for older pharmacotherapies like orlistat and non-incretin agents, dieting in insulin-sensitive versus resistant subjects, people undergoing typical combination diet, aerobic, and resistance exercise regimes, and so on, then we’ll have some healthy comparisons. I’ve omitted values for crash diets, ‘good practice’ high-protein very-low-calorie diets, mixed diet plus aerobic and resistance exercise regimens, and things that have not held up well, like chromium picolinate supplementation, as the heterogeneity in the literature is just too much to deal with.\nThe usual caveats for this domain apply, as there is a lot of heterogeneity in sampling, there’s error in measurement, bias in publication, and so on, so take this all with a pinch of salt and imagine that the presented numbers are point-estimates for reasonably-wide ranges. On that point, I don’t include confidence intervals for every value, and the Quarter FFM interval is the typically-cited range. Without further ado:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nFor most people, there’s nothing alarming about the composition of weight loss from GLP-1RAs when compared to a sampling from the wider literature. These loss ratios seem to be fine and at a level where weight loss is certainly healthful, especially for individuals suffering from serious obesity. With that said, semaglutide may be statistically—but not typically clinically—worse than tirzepatide across the published literature, and perhaps low-dose myostatin inhibitors could make both superior to most other weight loss approaches, if not in terms of the total lean mass loss ratio itself, then in terms of that in combination with the feasibility of treatment.\nThough I did not illustrate it, Regeneron’s high-dose trevogrumab and garetosmab therapy was superior in terms of lean mass loss to almost everything on this chart and it was superior to everything on this chart feasibility- and absolute loss in a given amount of time-wise, but garetosmab tolerability left something to be desired.\nThe results of the COURAGE and EMBRAZE trials are encouraging regardless of the validity or lack thereof of worries over excess lean mass loss with GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.\n\nJune 21st 2025 Update: A Systematic Review of GLP-1RAs\nThere’s a recent systematic review and meta-analysis on GLP-1RA effects on body composition and its results are worth mentioning.\nAcross twenty-two randomized controlled trials of varying lengths, drugs, and dosages, GLP-1RAs were associated with 3.55 kilograms of lost weight, 2.95 kilograms of lost fat mass, and 0.86 kilograms of lost lean mass. You might notice that 2.95 + 0.86 = 3.81, not 3.55, so something is amiss. You’d be right: all the estimates aren’t matched; not every study reported each outcome, so there’s a bit of noisiness. But, using these numbers, we can get a plausible range of values for the lean mass percentage. If we use the fat mass loss as a percentage of the overall body weight loss, GLP-1RAs are associated with 16.9% lean mass loss, and if we use the lean mass loss, the number is 24.2%, and if we reason from the sum of the lean and fat mass loss numbers, the lean percentage is 22.6%. Per the authors, lean mass loss generally comprised “approximately 25% of the total weight loss”, consistent with the Quarter FFM Rule.\nIf we look specifically at the results for top-line GLP-1RAs in use today, we see that they had reports on 15 mg weekly tirzepatide, 1 mg weekly semaglutide, and 14 mg daily oral semaglutide, in addition to reported on liraglutide given at dosages of 1.8 or 3.0 mg. Comparing the lean mass percentages for these different drugs is possible, and I’ve added a chart of this in this footnote 6, but I want to advise that I don’t think simply comparing fat loss percentages without contextualization is the right approach. The reason is, different trials led to different total weight loss, and total weight loss moderates the extent of lean mass loss. If you lose enough weight, you will eventually lose both more and a higher percentage of lean mass. It’s unclear if this happens in the range seen in these studies. Indeed, one could easily argue the opposite, but for low amounts of lost weight, because the first weight to go is lean mass in the form of water weight. So, we’ll isolate our view to the endpoints of trials with significant and positive weight loss.\nAs with the overall results, there is some imprecision due to unmatched estimates, so keep that in mind. Tirzepatide (15 mg/week) led to 10.81 kilograms of lost weight, of which 8.75 were fat and 1.84 were lean. Taking the lean percentage from the sum, we get 17.4%, or from the total based on fat mass lost, we get 19.1% versus 17.0% reasoning from fat and lean mass losses, respectively. For semaglutide (1mg/week), there were 6.24 kilograms of total weight lost, of which 4.37 were fat and 1.22 were lean. The same numbers were 16.4%, 30%, and 19.6%. For oral semaglutide, total losses were 2.60 kilograms, with 2 kilograms of fat and 0.60 lean, for 23.1% lean mass losses.\nIf we take all the aggregated treatment effects with weight loss in this review, we can assess the slopes for fat and lean mass loss versus total weight lost straightforwardly. By contrasting these slopes, we can gather an expectation about lean mass loss as weight loss grows. 7\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIn general, this weight loss seems to come with roughly one-fifth lean mass loss, and the slopes aren’t driven by either the tirzepatide datapoint or the estimates with nonsignificant total losses. Even removing all of them doesn’t really change the picture. The authors of the paper used the individual study point estimates when they did a meta-regression similar to this, and they found slopes of β = 0.7 and 0.09 for fat and lean mass loss, respectively. Their estimates were even more favorable towards GLP-1RAs than the estimates I made from the aggregated numbers. In both cases, linearity seemed tenable enough.\nThis review provided substantial and clear evidence: GLP-1RA-induced weight loss does not appear to produce meaningfully different compositional effects than typical weight loss, as represented by the Quarter FFM Rule.\n\nJune 23rd Update: The Age of Mass-Market Monoclonals?\nToday, Eli Lilly gave an incredible presentation at the ADA 2025 meeting. They showed the results of treating people with their activin type-II receptor inhibitor, bimagrumab, without and without the addition of semaglutide. This trial was allocated 55-56 people per arm to a total of nine different arms, and the efficacy results were nothing short of stupendous. Going solely off of what was presented:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few results to mention here. Let’s go left-to-right:\n\nBimagrumab on its own led to weight reductions, as seen in an earlier phase II trial.\n\nThese reductions were entirely due to the loss of fat.\n\nMeaning, muscle was entirely preserved in bimagrumab-only treatment.\n\nSemaglutide alone led to a proportion of fat loss not distinguishable from the Quarter FFM Rule. It did not lead to excess lean mass loss.\n\nCombination bimagrumab and semaglutide led to compositional improvements.\n\nProportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in typical weight loss.\n\nProportionally less lean mass was lost than is observed in weight loss with good control over exercise and diet.\n\nThe pace of weight loss was accelerated over semaglutide-based expectations.\n\nThe dosage of bimagrumab (10mg/kg in low-dose arms or 30mg/kg in high-dose arms) was unrelated to the extent of lean mass preservation, only to weight loss. 8\n\nThis fits with, but, at this dosage, fails to confirm the theory that much lower dosages could still deliver substantially improved lean mass preservation.\n\nReassuringly, bimagrumab did not seem to produce ‘useless’ muscle, as it was at least strength-preserving, and potentially strength-enhancing.\n\nPhysical function was improved.\n\nGrip strength was sustained or improved.\n\nLeptin levels fell by more and adiponectin levels increased by more among the bimagrumab users.\n\nProxied inflammation levels fell more with bimagrumab than with semaglutide alone.\nNow, onto the bad parts.\nFirstly, there’s a statistical caveat here: Eli Lilly primarily presented TOT instead of ITT estimates. These are more favorable to efficacy judgments and they make comparisons with other plots in different studies more difficult. Moreover, the difference may be particularly meaningful in this case, because high-dose monoclonal antibody treatments often come with a lot of side effects. This was no exception, although it should be noted that none of the side effects were “serious”, meaning becoming life-threatening.\nThe side effects that were above and beyond the typical side effects seen with semaglutide were:\n\nMuscle spasms (~50-75% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~6% for placebo and ~9-13% for semaglutide)\n\nAcne (~34-55% of the bimagrumab samples versus ~4% for placebo and 9-11% for semaglutide)\n\nLipid profiles showed an atherogenic shift.\n\nHDL levels decreased transiently in all weight loss groups, but they decreased more for bimagrumab users, and they only returned to baseline by 48 weeks for them, whereas they returned to baseline by 24 weeks for semaglutide users.\n\nFor all treatment groups, HDL levels increased above baseline to a comparable degree after the trial was through, so this is not an ongoing concern.\n\nLDL levels experienced a sustained roughly 10% decline for the semaglutide-only groups, but they experienced a sizable increase for the bimagrumab groups, ranging between 15% for the highest-dose group to 30% for the high-dose bimagrumab-alone group.\n\nThe levels in the high-dose groups that took semaglutide moved back to baseline by 24 weeks after treatment.\n\nLevels for the high-dose bimagrumab-only group dropped down to +18% by 24 weeks after treatment, and in both of the bimagrumab groups using low-dose semaglutide, they seemed to not move at all post-treatment, sticking around at ~13-16% above baseline.\nAll the caveats noted, this antibody treatment clearly has major potential and possible mass market appeal.\nAcne is generally mild and manageable, and muscle spasms are also generally mild, and they’re usually transient. Both are also side effects seen with anabolic steroid usage, and you can just ask bodybuilders how they deal with those issues: they’ll usually say they’re fine, manageable, and worthwhile.(Imagine how much this will help bodybuilders with cut and bulk cycles!) Since steroid users tend to be younger and hardier, they might not even care about the muscle spasms at all, but these could be a bigger issue for the general population and especially for the elderly. The lipid issue is also something seen with anabolic steroid usage, and it is also manageable, but definitely more pesky. The atherogenic effect of LDL accumulates with time, so therapy with bimagrumab might benefit from statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or simply not going on for a very long time. Bimagrumab definitely benefits from being paired with semaglutide to control the atherogenic risk, and it may also benefit if there are bimagrumab-related glycemic control issues down the line. This atherogenic issue might present an issue for the people who want to use bimagrumab to gain muscle, but they are neither here nor there. If there are other side effects like alopecia, those have not come up to my knowledge, and they will need to be investigated. That sort of thing may be a phase IV issue.\nIn the study’s high-dose bimagrumab and semaglutide arm, 94% of participants achieved at least a 30% reduction in fat mass, so given you can very likely just come off to get rid of the acne and muscle spasm side effects while sustaining your weight well due to the preserved muscle mass, a huge number of customers will find this to be worthwhile. When this moves to a subcutaneous dosage factor and the price drops, I am certain we’ll see lots of people clamoring to use this product and products like it. Eli Lilly is also running a trial with tirzepatide instead of semaglutide; it’s likely that trial will see even smaller reductions in lean mass and even greater weight loss, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects.\nBest of luck to Eli Lilly and to every other pharmaceutical company trying to make this a reality. What they’re doing here is nothing short of amazing. They are making weight loss an injectable, and making being—in terms of being muscular and low-fat—increasingly trivial. If companies like Eli Lilly, Regeneron, and Scholar Rock succeed, then Americans will become much more attractive, athletic, and healthy, fast.\nI hope to see more work done in this area to alleviate the issue of lean mass loss with weight loss, even though this study and studies like it show that it’s not a problem that’s unique to or accentuated in GLP-1RA-induced weight loss.\n\nWill I Keep Updating This Post?\nThere will be no more large edits unless something big happens. The evidence is clear enough and anyone still in denial about the fact that GLP-1RAs do not lend themselves to excess lean mass loss is fighting an uphill battle against mountains of evidence.\nI will likely only be doing small edits below, largely by bullet point, as new results come along. I also may go back and edit the parts on Regeneron’s, Scholar Rock’s, and Eli Lilly’s results once the papers are published for the preliminary trial results I covered.\n\nShort Updates\n\nJune 24, 2025: A subscriber sent me Locatelli et al.’s article arguing that adding exercise to incretin-based therapies would help to reduce the extent of lean mass loss. The data they cite overlaps considerably with what I cite here, so not much new on that front. The conclusions they reach are about benefits from exercise also valid, and if you scroll up to the weight loss method vs. compositional change chart I made, you can see evidence for it. As public health advice, their conclusions are not very useful, because motivating people is a major part of the issue with weight in the first place. But there might be utility in telling people that exercise can offset lean mass loss, or that the lean mass loss ratio is broadly similar between GLP-1RA therapy and other forms of weight loss.\n1\n\nThe most common means of measuring lean body mass is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, or DXA. When DXA is used, it “sees”:\n\nBone mineral (minerals in bone)\n\nFat mass (soft-tissue pixels whose X-ray attenuation matches adipose tissue, like subcutaneous, visceral, or large seams of inter- and intra-muscular fat large enough to dominate a pixel)\n\nLean soft-tissue mass (everything else, including water, muscle fibers, organs, connective tissue, plus any fat or fibrous tissue interspersed within muscle but too fine-grained for DXA to resolve)\nDXA classifies each 1-5mm pixel into one of these categories based on the ratio of low- and high-energy X-ray attenuation. If a pixel contains mostly fat, it lands in the “fat” bin, but small droplets and marbling of fat inside a muscle fiber bundle typically share the pixel with far more water-rich tissue, so the algorithm tags the whole pixel as “lean”. This also applies to fibrous scar tissue and edema in that DXA cannot distinguish them from contractile muscle.\nThis is known in the literature using DXA.\n\nIn studies using DXA in Duchenne Muscle Dystrophy (DMD), we see notes like: “Accumulation of fibrous tissue in boys with DMD can also affect lean body mass measures because DXA does not differentiate between healthy muscle and fibrous tissue and, therefore, measures of functional muscle mass could be overestimated. As DMD progresses, the percentage of total muscle volume decreases as muscle is replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. DXA does not differentiate fat infiltration from intermuscular or subcutaneous fat, and therefore cannot provide a completely accurate interpretation of fat distribution. In some cases, increases in fat mass measures could be a function of background therapy with glucocorticoids rather than a true representation of disease progression.”\n\nResearchers studying adipose tissue depots in HIV patients have noted: “Compared with MRI and CT, DXA cannot separate visceral fat from subcutaneous trunk fat and cannot discern organ fatty infiltration.”\n\nIn a tremendous review specifically to compare DXA and MRI body composition measurements cross-sectionally and longitudinally, the authors wrote: “We found that over the relatively short period of 2.5 years, both muscle and lean mass, as measured by MRI, decreased by 4% to 5% in both android and gynoid regions… The apparent lack of change observed by DXA may reflect its inability to differentiate between these compartments.” And, though DXA and MRI tend to agree, “several interventional studies have suggested that compared with MRI and other gold standard methods, DXA is unable to accurately detect longitudinal changes in lean muscle.”\nResults tend to speak to a systematic overestimation of lean mass that grows as intramuscular fat rises.\n2\n\nFor contrast, see this.\n3\n\nThough this is clinically meaningful in extent and unlikely to purely reflect confounding, I suspect this delta is significantly impacted by residual confounding and that the aging-related nature of so much weight loss in the U.K. Biobank sample explains why their weight loss was so inferior in this sense.\n4\n\nRegarding the mechanistic evidence and the impacts of GLP-1RAs on daily life, we now have genetic evidence that GLP-1 agonism is compositionally beneficial in the general population. A quick-and-dirty MR of my own in the U.K. Biobank indicates that genetically-heightened GLP-1 agonism is significantly related to improved health in many areas. Using the data from that study, we see that genetically-heightened levels of GLP-1 receptor agonism are related to lower weight due to lower fat mass and lower fat-free mass, but the effect on fat mass is relatively greater:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nAs an aside, these results are such that we can say that some(operative word) number of obese people are obese because they are GLP-1 deficient. As such, GLP-1RAs or other means of stimulating GLP-1 levels could mask their deficiency. This reality invites discussion of what it means to treat conditions like obesity versus “root causes”, as for some, the root cause really is being GLP-1 deficient.\n5\n\nAs an aside, the efforts to identify and promote lean mass preserving GLP-1RAs or complementary drugs to be taken alongside GLP-1RAs seem to be efforts to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. This logic applies equally well to efforts to promote exercise and diet alongside GLP-1RAs as, again, there is no real reason to believe there’s a problem. Additionally, it should be noted that because muscle mass is easier to regain than to gain, this problem is rapidly amenable to remedies if it ever turns out to be a real one.\nPeople may have their concerns—as is their right—but they have no legitimate reasons to transform them into worries for others.\n6\n\nThe graph can be found here:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nThe estimated slopes are not affected by removing the numbers for metformin and sitagliptin.\n8\n\nAdditionally, if we contrast the reports for Healio and the numbers shown on available conference presentation slides, we can see that combination bimagrumab and semaglutide pharmacotherapy might’ve led to continued weight loss after 24 post-treatment weeks, with the semaglutide-alone groups regaining some weight. Importantly, we do not know if this is a correct inference yet, because the consistency of the estimands for these numbers is unknown. I suspect this possible result is actually due to an error in reporting to Healio, as some of their reported “72-week results” are identical to 48-week results. But some differ, so there’s a question of what’s right.\nA bit of carelessness in their reporting might have happened, but that’ll likely be ironed out when the papers eventually drop.",

To the researcher claiming Mount Everest is actually warm, all that matters is the result of their &#8216;analysis&#8217;, where they&#8217;ve &#8216;controlled&#8217; for a variable that is, incidentally, the key explanatory variable in this case. This can also be extended so, for example, McDonald&#8217;s is equivalent to a Michelin 3-Star restaurant after controlling for the quality of ingredients, preparation, ambience, and price.</p><p>If the responsible researcher is ignorant of this issue, they&#8217;re not lying, they&#8217;re just mistaken. But if they&#8217;re aware of what the problem is and they are nonetheless insistent that Mount Everest is actually warm without qualification, then they&#8217;re lying. As it happens, plenty of researchers lie in just such a way. Any economist worth their salt will not find themselves conducting an Everest Regression, and yet, when it&#8217;s convenient, they&#8217;ll use them if they want to persuade people.</p><p>A pair of researchers published a paper on immigration and crime in Germany days before the recent election. Their conclusion? <a href=\"https://www.ifo.de/en/publications/2025/article-journal/steigert-migration-die-kriminalitat-ein-datenbasierter-blick\">More foreigners does not increase the crime rate.</a></p><p>Immigrants in Germany have a vastly elevated crime rate compared to natives, and this is true across the board, from <a href=\"https://x.com/Marc_Vanguard_i/status/1892673324934918564\">theft and fraud</a> to <a href=\"https://x.com/Marc_Vanguard_i/status/1892305794902692231\">rapes and sexual violence</a> to <a href=\"https://x.com/Marc_Vanguard_i/status/1891532710105035215\">homicide and other violent crimes</a>.

But wait! Why did they control for the suspect rate? That is, in effect, controlling for the dependent variable to then say that foreign-born population shares are unrelated to crime. But if they <em>drive </em>differences in crime across different parts of Germany, this is just controlling for altitude and declaring Everest is hot, stating that stadiums make people run fast!</p><p>Ignoring, for a moment, that the authors used a very inappropriate control that trivializes their results, they were not equipped to produce a causally-informative result in the first place. What their paper entails doing is, instead, proposing a strong ecological hypothesis, where differences between regions drive differences in criminality, and foreigners happen to be situated in places with high crime due to some sort of sorting mechanism. They then sought to show that there&#8217;s some data that can fit with this hypothesis. What they did is, thus, arguably, appropriate, but to believe that, you have to believe the model, and the evidence from outside of the exercise they presented fits exceptionally poorly with their proposed model.</p><p>In order of increasing relevance and debunky-ness, consider these results:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08862605241311611\">Using individual-level data</a>, immigrants in Sweden remain more likely to commit rapes even after controlling for much better measures of socioeconomic status, like individual welfare receipt, income, and neighborhood-level deprivation, and even for prior criminal behavior and all of alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, and having any psychiatric disorder. Because this is individual-level rather than district or region level data, it should be considered more convincing than the ecological exercise from the German crime paper, but if one believes a strong ecological model, it may not be.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/jailbirds-of-a-feather-flock-together\">Ecological models of the determination of crime are not supported</a> by the large, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1736922801230033396\">causally</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1651052199496040449\">informative</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1668514274178654210\">studies</a> that have been done on them.

Quoting them:</p><blockquote><p>This finding fuels the concern that migration could endanger security due to a higher tendency for criminality among foreigners. Security concerns are a central argument in the current election campaign for limiting immigration. For example, Bavarian Prime Minister Markus S&#246;der stressed at the CSU winter retreat that migration must be &#8220;limited and thus internal security improved&#8221;. The CDU/CSU&#8217;s candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, believes that this is &#8220;bringing problems into the country&#8221; and calls for the revocation of German citizenship for criminal citizens who have a second nationality.</p></blockquote><p>This paper was written less as part of a truth-seeking effort, and more to accomplish a political goal, to provide evidence that one of the biggest issues to voters in a forthcoming election wasn&#8217;t really much of an issue at all. This objective and the obviousness of the issue to anyone with a modicum of competence makes this paper a pretty clear example of scientists lying and engaging in an attempt at gaslighting.</p><p>But there&#8217;s worse out there. As I&#8217;ll show, scientists often lie with far more brazenness.</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>A Message From My Sponsor</em></h3><p>Steve Jobs is quoted as saying, &#8220;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

Poorly Related To Their Papers</h3><p>In 1999, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/189139\">Pitkin, Branagan and Burmeister</a> analyzed random samples of articles and their abstracts published in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine, BMJ, JAMA, Lancet, NEJM, </em>and <em>CMAJ, </em>several top-tier medical journals. They found that large portions of the papers published in those journals had reporting inconsistencies between what was in the abstract and what was in article bodies.</p><p>In Pitkin, Branagan and Burmeister&#8217;s study, &#8220;inconsistency&#8221; refers to an abstract and a paper&#8217;s body presenting statistics that do not agree with one another for reasons not due to chance, like rounding. For example, if my abstract says &#8220;We found 1+1=2&#8221; and my article says &#8220;We did not find that 1+1=2&#8221;, that&#8217;s inconsistent. They also looked at whether abstracts included omissions, which were defined as times when statistics were presented in abstracts and then never shown in the bodies of papers.</p><p>For one journal, the majority of papers (68%) had one or both or these errors; for all journals, the number with such issues was always sizable:<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\"

evaluated a randomized controlled trial that was intended to assess if the field could solve the problem by identifying specific errors authors made, during the review process. Despite the identification, few authors corrected their mistakes, and the intervention group saw 28% of abstracts being inconsistent versus 26% in the control group. After this, <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1030556\">the full original team of researchers assessed the effectiveness of a policy adopted by </a><em><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/1030556\">JAMA</a>, </em>wherein the journal provided the impetus to be consistent to submitting authors. This policy seemed to be effective, as, pre-intervention, 52% of abstracts had inconsistencies versus 20% after the policy went into effect. Perhaps this was more effective than their earlier experiment because the journal staff were the ones providing notice about inconsistencies.</p><p>The finding that abstracts are reliably unreliable has been replicated umpteen times, across many fields, and there&#8217;s no doubt that a substantial number of the abstracts from studies published in practically any field will be inconsistent with their papers. We know this holds in fields as diverse as <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/clinchem/article-abstract/47/1/149/5639045\">clinical chemistry</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002961025000728\">surgery</a> [<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/2014/05010/Inconsistencies_Between_Abstracts_and_Manuscripts.16.aspx\">1</a>], <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12786\">candidate gene studies</a>, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iej.13832\">dentistry</a>, <a href=\"https://ebm.bmj.com/content/25/5/178.info\">psychiatry and psychology</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1345/aph.1d416\">pharmacy</a>, and even <a href=\"https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0459-5\">biomedical research writ large</a> [<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316172405_Siebers_R_How_accurate_is_data_in_abstracts_of_research_articles_New_Zealand_Journal_of_Medical_Laboratory_Science_2000_54_22-23\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1710755115\">2</a>].</p><p>It&#8217;s possible to argue that these results indicate <em>errors</em> rather than evidence&#8212;<em>prima facie </em>or direct&#8212;of malfeasance.

Regardless of the cause, they&#8217;re still evidence of a need to place less trust in papers, and particularly in their abstracts.

For example, sometimes images are repeated between papers and authors claim they&#8217;re from different experiments. This often happens in the cases of paper mills, where the people producing the purchased papers are lazily reusing assets for different customers.</p><p>Type II image manipulation can also be innocuous, but that&#8217;s less often the case. These involve taking an image and duplicating part of it while changing its orientation, zooming in, or making other mildly obscuring presentation choices. Unfortunately, these sorts of manipulations are usually not innocuous, even though there&#8217;s still plenty of opportunity for them to be. When they are innocuous, they often come with an explicit note, like &#8220;Image B is a zoomed-in version of image A.&#8221;</p><p>Type III image manipulation can <em>rarely </em>be innocuous. This manipulation involves duplicating an image but outright altering some aspect of it. This is usually done to make a fake finding, and rarely done to, say, increase the contrast to reveal difficult to see elements of images compared to their raw form.</p><p>Out of 1,035 papers screened for a systematic review of preclinical depression work, the authors of this study found that 588 included images, and 19% of those that had images featured duplicates. That's 19% with a very clear issue. Now maybe some of those are innocuous accidental duplications of the Type I variety. But if you look at the breakdown, it actually seems that there are more Type II and III, severe duplication events. That's bad, and this is a lower bound on how bad things are.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"571.1538461538462\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:693,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-x2g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F70a28ec0-e87a-4bef-b146-24d8799edb6f_1924x916.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">Berrio and Kalliokoski 2024, Figure 2</figcaption></figure></div><p>Before going on, do note: 17 &#8220;Other&#8221; problems, not fitting into the typical taxonomy.

stratified by their checklist-based &#8220;quality of reporting&#8221;, they seemed to be indistinguishable from the papers that weren't obviously fraudulent. Their &#8220;quality of reporting&#8221; came out at 5.8 out of 10 versus 5.1 out of 10 for all of the studies with a quality rating. The &#8220;risk of bias&#8221; wasn't much better, showing a score of 3.2 out of 11 for the potentially fraudulent studies and 2.9 out of 11 across every study where the risk of bias was reported.</p><p>This is an amazingly unfortunate finding. It indicates common metrics for indicating study quality <em>don't pick up outright, visually-detectable problems</em>. Or, maybe they do detect problems, and there are just huge numbers of undetected problems among remaining studies. That is the best case scenario, but it's not a happy one either! But surely peer reviewers, editors, and readers of studies will identify and penalize papers with image duplication issues, right? This is an analysis of published works, so the answer must be <em>no </em>to the question about peer review. But what about prestige? As it turns out, papers with image duplication issues are published in journals just as high-impact as papers without image duplication issues, and the number of citations to problematic papers is equivalent to the number of citations to ones that are not visibly problematic:<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\"

they just don&#8217;t care about QRPs like the ones listed here. This holds even looking at major QRPs like selectively reporting results. Regardless, the results of this survey are independent, major evidence that, if anything, the 19% image duplication rate I mentioned vastly undersells rates of misbehavior-driven problems in science, and this also adds considerable direct evidence that fraud is common.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Needed: More Data, More Retractions, Better Mechanisms</h3><p>A while back, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/why-economists-detect-fraud\">I wrote about the case of an AER paper on dividend taxation</a> that included a line in its code that showed the main result was fraudulent. The authors simply divided one of their coefficients to promote the appearance of a desired result. To make matters worse, their results were not robust and were driven by an unreasonable specification choice. The reason this fraud was caught is that papers in the AER are supposed to have replication packages&#8212;code and, hopefully, data to make their results reproducible. Looking through the code made the fraud apparent; having the data to reproduce the result proved the paper&#8217;s policy-relevant conclusions were not robust in any case.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a></p><p>This sort of data sleuthing is only rarely possible for a simple reason: <em>few papers have available data</em>. To make things worse, few papers include the code required to reproduce their analyses, the ones that do tend to have really bad code,<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> and it&#8217;s exceptionally rare to get both data and code at the same time. In the majority of cases across many fields, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1875311133655232643\">papers making the statement that &#8216;data is available upon request&#8217; don&#8217;t even provide their data when it&#8217;s requested</a>!<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-11\" href=\"#footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a></p><p>The situation this leaves science in is not a favorable one. If we want to reliably fight fraud, data and code <em>needs</em> to be provided. There <em>are </em>plenty of techniques to find errors<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-12\" href=\"#footnote-12\" target=\"_self\">12</a> which <em>might </em>be indicative of fraud or at least low-quality research, but they might not lead to decisive enough indictments of bad research for actions to happen, and actions <em>do </em>need to happen, or people will be misled. This applies not only to the public, but to researchers who build on fraudulent work. For example, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2502439122\">it took more than a decade for the authors of this meta-analysis to note that their results were polluted by the inclusion of fraudulent datapoints</a>, through only slight fault of their own.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-13\" href=\"#footnote-13\" target=\"_self\">13</a> There have been tons of (oftentimes very expensive) studies that attempted to replicate the results of fraudsters like Francesca Gino and Dan Ariely, and in the biomedical sciences, <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/eliminating-distractions-in-longevity\">fraud has even provided the basis for clinical trials</a> which, seemingly inevitably, fail.</p><p>To stop this, in addition to improved detection, we need improved retraction: more papers need to be pulled from the literature.

I suspect the increase in retractions in more recent years reflects increasingly positive attitudes towards retraction. It remains the case that many researchers think that retractions are a punishment, but that view <em>feels </em>like it&#8217;s fading&#8212;and it should fade! It is an incorrect view, and retractions need to be used to clean up even majorly erroneous science, rather than just the transparently fraudulent variety.</p><p>The bad news is that retractions do not have the huge effects they should. Using data on over 1,100 scientific retractions, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article-abstract/97/5/1118/58260/Retractions\">researchers found</a> that the resulting impact on citations was small: a 5-10% reduction in the citation rate, with somewhat larger effects for studies retracted for fraud or misconduct as opposed to honest error. That&#8217;s something, but it&#8217;s not much.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-14\" href=\"#footnote-14\" target=\"_self\">14</a> Retractions are nice, there should be a lot more of them, but something else must be done unless the effect of retractions dramatically changes.</p><p>I was recently introduced to the practical implementation of a partial solution in <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1898537158610128922\">a paper I had the luck to review</a>: <em>journal-level mechanism design</em>. A journal implemented automatic warnings to researchers if they cited retracted papers. The result? A significant reduction in citations going to retracted papers. What&#8217;s more, the citations to retracted papers became more negative towards them! This was not enough to fully address the issue of citing retracted works, but it&#8217;s a starting point, and I think it can inspire a much more complete solution set.</p><p>That solution? Designing and implementing more (hopefully cheap and easily deployed) mechanisms just like this one. Maybe abstract inconsistency can be identified with AI. Perhaps journals can all deploy tools to automatically detect and classify image duplication, and maybe someone can create a database of images from scientific papers to query more broadly. Papers that fail to provide their code could be automatically rejected because they&#8217;re suspect. Journals could host data instead of leaving it up to authors to choose when and to whom to provide it. There are tons of possibilities!</p><p>But until we start seeing anti-fraud measures becoming commonplace and science rapidly cleaning itself up of the fraud it&#8217;s been beset by, we&#8217;ll just have to live with and adapt to the fact that you can&#8217;t trust what papers say and researchers frequently lie.</p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Fundamentally, when an individual-level analysis &#8216;controls away&#8217; an effect without some means of causal identification, it runs into the issue that the immigrants in reality still differ from post-control immigrants. &#8216;Explaining&#8217; the difference between immigrants and natives adds basically nothing to any discussion unless the proposed explanatory variables are actually causally impactful and open to being altered.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-2\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-2\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>One could argue that this paper is too theoretically distinct, because it specifically references the impacts of refugees, but those are most of the immigrants that people consider problematic, so the point is moot.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-3\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-3\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">3</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Unfortunately, we are not provided with the names to identify which journals are most problematic.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-4\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-4\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">4</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Which <a href=\"https://ebm.bmj.com/content/27/2/97.abstract\">can matter</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-5\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-5\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">5</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Image duplication is the type of fraud that disgraced neuropathologist <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/eliminating-distractions-in-longevity\">Eliezer Masliah was caught doing</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-6\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-6\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">6</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Because these studies are so hard to distinguish from ones that are not clearly problematic, it&#8217;s unclear if the studies discussed here contribute to the replication crisis.

      "script_text": "This post is brought to you by my sponsor, Warp.\nThis was a timed post. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. You can find my previous timed post here. I placed the advertisement before I started my writing timer.\n\nThe authors of scientific papers often say one thing and find another; they concoct a story around a set of findings that they might not have even made, or which they might have actually even contradicted. This happens surprisingly often, and it’s a very serious issue for a few reasons. For example:\n\nMost people don’t read papers at all, so what they might hear is polluted second-hand information, and if they do read papers, they usually just read titles and abstracts, and those are frequently wrong.\n\nPeople trust scientists and scientific institutions, and they should be able to trust scientists and scientific institutions. If that trust is broken, an important institution can lose a lot of its power for doing good.\n\nPeople trust peer reviewed works, and they should able to trust in the power of peer reviewed works. If that trust is broken ( and it should currently be), a potentially important tool loses a lot of its power for doing good.\n\nScientific institutions trust scientists, and they allocate funding based on the things scientists tell them. assuming they’re trustworthy, so when that trust is violated, they’re liable to misallocate funding and research effort.\n\nAnd the list goes on…\nAt times, this violation of trust is so egregious that it’s easy to wonder how it could have become publicly known in the first place. Ideally, outright lying is something that gets caught in peer review, or which people are just too ashamed to do. But though you might think better of scientists than so many of them have proven to be, plenty of them do still brazenly lie.\n\nLying in scientific papers happens all the time.\nFor example, last year I dissected a paper that several newspapers had reported on which alleged that physically high ceilings in test-taking locations made students score worse on their exams. This paper’s abstract, title, text, and the public remarks to journalists from the authors all implied that was what they found, but their actual result—correctly shown in a table in the paper and reproducible from their code and data—was the complete opposite: higher ceilings were associated with higher test scores! Making a viral hubbub about this managed to get the paper retracted— eventually —but the retraction notice barely mentioned any of the paper’s problems and, instead, said that whatever issues warranted retraction were examples of good ole “honest error”.\nUsually when a paper contains lies, they’re hidden a bit better than that. Consider the concept of an Everest Regression. We know Mount Everest is very cold, but a clever person can argue that it’s not cold, once you control for its high altitude. The high altitude of Mount Everest is why it’s cold, but that doesn’t matter. To the researcher claiming Mount Everest is actually warm, all that matters is the result of their ‘analysis’, where they’ve ‘controlled’ for a variable that is, incidentally, the key explanatory variable in this case. This can also be extended so, for example, McDonald’s is equivalent to a Michelin 3-Star restaurant after controlling for the quality of ingredients, preparation, ambience, and price.\nIf the responsible researcher is ignorant of this issue, they’re not lying, they’re just mistaken. But if they’re aware of what the problem is and they are nonetheless insistent that Mount Everest is actually warm without qualification, then they’re lying. As it happens, plenty of researchers lie in just such a way. Any economist worth their salt will not find themselves conducting an Everest Regression, and yet, when it’s convenient, they’ll use them if they want to persuade people.\nA pair of researchers published a paper on immigration and crime in Germany days before the recent election. Their conclusion? More foreigners does not increase the crime rate.\nImmigrants in Germany have a vastly elevated crime rate compared to natives, and this is true across the board, from theft and fraud to rapes and sexual violence to homicide and other violent crimes. Consistent with this, the paper reports that the higher the proportion of foreigners in a district or region (pictured below), the higher its crime rate:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nAlipour and Harm Adema 2025, Figure 3A. Note that the district-level regression was much stronger.\nBut, after controlling for differences in age, sex, suspect rate, unemployment, and taking out some fixed effects, immigration at the district or region level is no longer related to crime. But wait! Why did they control for the suspect rate? That is, in effect, controlling for the dependent variable to then say that foreign-born population shares are unrelated to crime. But if they drive differences in crime across different parts of Germany, this is just controlling for altitude and declaring Everest is hot, stating that stadiums make people run fast!\nIgnoring, for a moment, that the authors used a very inappropriate control that trivializes their results, they were not equipped to produce a causally-informative result in the first place. What their paper entails doing is, instead, proposing a strong ecological hypothesis, where differences between regions drive differences in criminality, and foreigners happen to be situated in places with high crime due to some sort of sorting mechanism. They then sought to show that there’s some data that can fit with this hypothesis. What they did is, thus, arguably, appropriate, but to believe that, you have to believe the model, and the evidence from outside of the exercise they presented fits exceptionally poorly with their proposed model.\nIn order of increasing relevance and debunky-ness, consider these results:\n\nUsing individual-level data, immigrants in Sweden remain more likely to commit rapes even after controlling for much better measures of socioeconomic status, like individual welfare receipt, income, and neighborhood-level deprivation, and even for prior criminal behavior and all of alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, and having any psychiatric disorder. Because this is individual-level rather than district or region level data, it should be considered more convincing than the ecological exercise from the German crime paper, but if one believes a strong ecological model, it may not be. 1\n\nEcological models of the determination of crime are not supported by the large, causally informative studies that have been done on them. Ecological models have not held up well at all, and what remains of ecological hypotheses is, at best, very weak effects which are nowhere near sufficient to explain immigrant overrepresentation in crime in Germany.\n\nCausally-informative evidence from Germany that exploits administrative refugee assignments to estimate immigrants’ impacts on crime shows that they do, in fact, increase crime. 2 But the crime-producing effect of refugee settlement is lagged, meaning it doesn’t happen instantaneously. This effectively adds insult to injury, because by its nature, a lagged effect adds evidence that the cross-sectional ecological model is inappropriate.\nThe authors of this paper produced a compromised analysis that doesn’t hold up and they made it painfully obvious that their findings were politically motivated. Quoting them:\n\nThis finding fuels the concern that migration could endanger security due to a higher tendency for criminality among foreigners. Security concerns are a central argument in the current election campaign for limiting immigration. For example, Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder stressed at the CSU winter retreat that migration must be “limited and thus internal security improved”. The CDU/CSU’s candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, believes that this is “bringing problems into the country” and calls for the revocation of German citizenship for criminal citizens who have a second nationality.\nThis paper was written less as part of a truth-seeking effort, and more to accomplish a political goal, to provide evidence that one of the biggest issues to voters in a forthcoming election wasn’t really much of an issue at all. This objective and the obviousness of the issue to anyone with a modicum of competence makes this paper a pretty clear example of scientists lying and engaging in an attempt at gaslighting.\nBut there’s worse out there. As I’ll show, scientists often lie with far more brazenness.\n\nA Message From My Sponsor\nSteve Jobs is quoted as saying, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

They found that large portions of the papers published in those journals had reporting inconsistencies between what was in the abstract and what was in article bodies.\nIn Pitkin, Branagan and Burmeister’s study, “inconsistency” refers to an abstract and a paper’s body presenting statistics that do not agree with one another for reasons not due to chance, like rounding. For example, if my abstract says “We found 1+1=2” and my article says “We did not find that 1+1=2”, that’s inconsistent. They also looked at whether abstracts included omissions, which were defined as times when statistics were presented in abstracts and then never shown in the bodies of papers.\nFor one journal, the majority of papers (68%) had one or both or these errors; for all journals, the number with such issues was always sizable: 3\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nTwo of the authors of this research came back later and evaluated a randomized controlled trial that was intended to assess if the field could solve the problem by identifying specific errors authors made, during the review process. Despite the identification, few authors corrected their mistakes, and the intervention group saw 28% of abstracts being inconsistent versus 26% in the control group. After this, the full original team of researchers assessed the effectiveness of a policy adopted by JAMA, wherein the journal provided the impetus to be consistent to submitting authors. This policy seemed to be effective, as, pre-intervention, 52% of abstracts had inconsistencies versus 20% after the policy went into effect. Perhaps this was more effective than their earlier experiment because the journal staff were the ones providing notice about inconsistencies.\nThe finding that abstracts are reliably unreliable has been replicated umpteen times, across many fields, and there’s no doubt that a substantial number of the abstracts from studies published in practically any field will be inconsistent with their papers. We know this holds in fields as diverse as clinical chemistry, surgery[ 1], candidate gene studies, dentistry, psychiatry and psychology, pharmacy, and even biomedical research writ large[ 1, 2].\nIt’s possible to argue that these results indicate errors rather than evidence— prima facie or direct—of malfeasance. But many of these abstracts don’t just have benign errors, they contain spin 4, which is hard to be anything but intentional. Other types of evidence for malfeasance are similar to this, in that they could be down to error, in part or in whole. Regardless of the cause, they’re still evidence of a need to place less trust in papers, and particularly in their abstracts. While these findings probably reflect a mix of both error and fraud, no matter: there’s plenty of direct evidence of fraud.\n\nThere Are Many (Frequently Obvious) Fraudsters\nThanks to alert sleuths and automated detection tools, some of the most obvious examples of scientific fraud are now being noticed at scale. A preprint from last year showed this for image duplication in preclinical depression studies. 5 The three types of duplication the article looked into were simple duplications, duplications with image repositioning, and duplications with edits; visually, those look like this:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBerrio and Kalliokoski 2024, Figure 1\nType I image manipulation is the most likely to be innocuous, but it is still sometimes suspect. For example, sometimes images are repeated between papers and authors claim they’re from different experiments. This often happens in the cases of paper mills, where the people producing the purchased papers are lazily reusing assets for different customers.\nType II image manipulation can also be innocuous, but that’s less often the case. These involve taking an image and duplicating part of it while changing its orientation, zooming in, or making other mildly obscuring presentation choices. Unfortunately, these sorts of manipulations are usually not innocuous, even though there’s still plenty of opportunity for them to be. When they are innocuous, they often come with an explicit note, like “Image B is a zoomed-in version of image A.”\nType III image manipulation can rarely be innocuous. This manipulation involves duplicating an image but outright altering some aspect of it. This is usually done to make a fake finding, and rarely done to, say, increase the contrast to reveal difficult to see elements of images compared to their raw form.\nOut of 1,035 papers screened for a systematic review of preclinical depression work, the authors of this study found that 588 included images, and 19% of those that had images featured duplicates. That's 19% with a very clear issue. Now maybe some of those are innocuous accidental duplications of the Type I variety. But if you look at the breakdown, it actually seems that there are more Type II and III, severe duplication events. That's bad, and this is a lower bound on how bad things are.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBerrio and Kalliokoski 2024, Figure 2\nBefore going on, do note: 17 “Other” problems, not fitting into the typical taxonomy. These were described as issues like images being switched around, leading to mismatched descriptions, and cases where images appeared to come from a \"paper mill\" that was fabricating research at the request of paper authors.\nThis is all bad, but what does it do? It’s somewhat hard to say. The studies that had duplication issues tended to have smaller variances and they reported 0.81 g larger effects than studies that weren't flagged, but though that’s biasing for a meta-analysis or review, they still fit in with plenty of the studies that didn’t have duplication issues:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBerrio and Kalliokoski 2024, Figure 3\nEven when these problematic papers were stratified by their checklist-based “quality of reporting”, they seemed to be indistinguishable from the papers that weren't obviously fraudulent. Their “quality of reporting” came out at 5.8 out of 10 versus 5.1 out of 10 for all of the studies with a quality rating. The “risk of bias” wasn't much better, showing a score of 3.2 out of 11 for the potentially fraudulent studies and 2.9 out of 11 across every study where the risk of bias was reported.\nThis is an amazingly unfortunate finding. It indicates common metrics for indicating study quality don't pick up outright, visually-detectable problems. Or, maybe they do detect problems, and there are just huge numbers of undetected problems among remaining studies. That is the best case scenario, but it's not a happy one either! But surely peer reviewers, editors, and readers of studies will identify and penalize papers with image duplication issues, right? This is an analysis of published works, so the answer must be no to the question about peer review. But what about prestige? As it turns out, papers with image duplication issues are published in journals just as high-impact as papers without image duplication issues, and the number of citations to problematic papers is equivalent to the number of citations to ones that are not visibly problematic: 6\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nBerrio and Kalliokoski 2024, Figure 4\nThe authors wrote:\n\nWe would suspect that the reason why most researchers would agree with the statement that research fraud is rare, all the while data seems to point to the contrary, is that they have not encountered it personally.\nPerhaps there’s something to this. When researchers are explicitly asked whether they have doubts about the integrity of different groups’ research, they tend to state two things:\n\nThey don’t doubt their research or the research of their collaborators.\n\nThey often doubt the research of everyone else.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nResponses to questions about doubts concerning the integrity of research conducted by various categories of researchers, via John, Lowenstein and Prelec 2012, Fig. 2. U.S. researcher sample.\nBut hold on. Though this is what researchers say, if you ask them how often they engage in questionable research practices (QRPs), there’s widespread admission to problematic scientific behaviors: 7\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe prevalence of QRPs is too high to be consistent with people’s stated confidence in the integrity of their work, unless they just don’t care about QRPs like the ones listed here. This holds even looking at major QRPs like selectively reporting results. Regardless, the results of this survey are independent, major evidence that, if anything, the 19% image duplication rate I mentioned vastly undersells rates of misbehavior-driven problems in science, and this also adds considerable direct evidence that fraud is common. 8\n\nNeeded: More Data, More Retractions, Better Mechanisms\nA while back, I wrote about the case of an AER paper on dividend taxation that included a line in its code that showed the main result was fraudulent. The authors simply divided one of their coefficients to promote the appearance of a desired result. To make matters worse, their results were not robust and were driven by an unreasonable specification choice. The reason this fraud was caught is that papers in the AER are supposed to have replication packages—code and, hopefully, data to make their results reproducible. Looking through the code made the fraud apparent; having the data to reproduce the result proved the paper’s policy-relevant conclusions were not robust in any case. 9\nThis sort of data sleuthing is only rarely possible for a simple reason: few papers have available data. To make things worse, few papers include the code required to reproduce their analyses, the ones that do tend to have really bad code, 10 and it’s exceptionally rare to get both data and code at the same time. In the majority of cases across many fields, papers making the statement that ‘data is available upon request’ don’t even provide their data when it’s requested! 11\nThe situation this leaves science in is not a favorable one. If we want to reliably fight fraud, data and code needs to be provided. There are plenty of techniques to find errors 12 which might be indicative of fraud or at least low-quality research, but they might not lead to decisive enough indictments of bad research for actions to happen, and actions do need to happen, or people will be misled. This applies not only to the public, but to researchers who build on fraudulent work. For example, it took more than a decade for the authors of this meta-analysis to note that their results were polluted by the inclusion of fraudulent datapoints, through only slight fault of their own. 13 There have been tons of (oftentimes very expensive) studies that attempted to replicate the results of fraudsters like Francesca Gino and Dan Ariely, and in the biomedical sciences, fraud has even provided the basis for clinical trials which, seemingly inevitably, fail.\nTo stop this, in addition to improved detection, we need improved retraction: more papers need to be pulled from the literature. The good news is that there are increasingly many retractions in even pretty far out fields.\n\nImage: Rates on the rise. Line chart showing retraction rates, which is the number of retractions of papers published in a given year divided by the overall number of papers published that same year, from two data sources, Dimensions Author Check and Signals from 2014 to 2024. There has been a steep rise in the rate of retractions.\n\n\n\nVan Noorden 2025\nThe reasons for the increase have been linked to institutional changes that increased the ease of publication and retraction, but that study is now dated. I suspect the increase in retractions in more recent years reflects increasingly positive attitudes towards retraction. It remains the case that many researchers think that retractions are a punishment, but that view feels like it’s fading—and it should fade! It is an incorrect view, and retractions need to be used to clean up even majorly erroneous science, rather than just the transparently fraudulent variety.\nThe bad news is that retractions do not have the huge effects they should. Using data on over 1,100 scientific retractions, researchers found that the resulting impact on citations was small: a 5-10% reduction in the citation rate, with somewhat larger effects for studies retracted for fraud or misconduct as opposed to honest error. That’s something, but it’s not much. 14 Retractions are nice, there should be a lot more of them, but something else must be done unless the effect of retractions dramatically changes.\nI was recently introduced to the practical implementation of a partial solution in a paper I had the luck to review: journal-level mechanism design. A journal implemented automatic warnings to researchers if they cited retracted papers. The result? A significant reduction in citations going to retracted papers. What’s more, the citations to retracted papers became more negative towards them! This was not enough to fully address the issue of citing retracted works, but it’s a starting point, and I think it can inspire a much more complete solution set.\nThat solution? Designing and implementing more (hopefully cheap and easily deployed) mechanisms just like this one. Maybe abstract inconsistency can be identified with AI. Perhaps journals can all deploy tools to automatically detect and classify image duplication, and maybe someone can create a database of images from scientific papers to query more broadly. Papers that fail to provide their code could be automatically rejected because they’re suspect. Journals could host data instead of leaving it up to authors to choose when and to whom to provide it. There are tons of possibilities!\nBut until we start seeing anti-fraud measures becoming commonplace and science rapidly cleaning itself up of the fraud it’s been beset by, we’ll just have to live with and adapt to the fact that you can’t trust what papers say and researchers frequently lie.\n1\n\nFundamentally, when an individual-level analysis ‘controls away’ an effect without some means of causal identification, it runs into the issue that the immigrants in reality still differ from post-control immigrants. ‘Explaining’ the difference between immigrants and natives adds basically nothing to any discussion unless the proposed explanatory variables are actually causally impactful and open to being altered.\n2\n\nOne could argue that this paper is too theoretically distinct, because it specifically references the impacts of refugees, but those are most of the immigrants that people consider problematic, so the point is moot.\n3\n\nUnfortunately, we are not provided with the names to identify which journals are most problematic.\n4\n\nWhich can matter.\n5\n\nImage duplication is the type of fraud that disgraced neuropathologist Eliezer Masliah was caught doing.\n6\n\nBecause these studies are so hard to distinguish from ones that are not clearly problematic, it’s unclear if the studies discussed here contribute to the replication crisis. They might alongside additional fraudulent studies that didn’t have obvious image duplication issues, but that’s not established. Incompetence is likely a more common explanation for replication issues. For example, consider studies on the effects of experiencing poverty on cognition.\n7\n\nThis study also provides prevalence estimates for Germany, but they were computed with an invalid method. The reason the method is invalid is that it understates the QRP rate. In the case of the Indonesian data, that method was applied to the data to see what the result would be, and the rate people admit they do fraud at was higher than the rate that was estimated. This is a clear indictment of the method, which is not to say that the other method is impervious to issues, merely that it isn’t prima facie unreasonable.\n8\n\nThis is another image-based fraud detection study that I found highly interesting. Other studies dealing with the same categories of image duplication have produced interesting findings like that duplication rates vary by country. Retraction rates also vary by country, and they do not seem to vary with quality of scientific institutions but, instead, its reverse. This makes sense, because those places are likely to produce more retraction-worthy science.\n\nImage: Retraction rates by country. A chart showing national retraction rates from 2014-2024, ranging from 0 to 1%, for nine countries. Rates differ depending on the source of data, Signals or Dimensions, but Ethiopia has the highest retraction rate among countries that publish a relatively large number of papers.\n\n\n\nVan Noorden 2025\n9\n\nThe AEA looks good in this instance, but their data availability practices still leave a lot to be desired.\n10\n\nAcademics are notoriously bad at programming.\n11\n\nNotably, not sharing data upon request is not reliably related to the presence of statistical errors in papers.\n12\n\nIncreasingly many!\n13\n\nIt was still their fault for not being careful enough since the fraud was known at the time they did their meta-analysis, but this is a simple mistake and an abnormal occurrence. They’re hardly at serious fault, because it is generally not considered necessary to look into whether researchers who produced datapoints for meta-analysis were frauds.\nThe best solution is likely to be a detailed retraction in order to reduce misapprehensions based on the initial results, but another possibility is simply correcting the paper. The problem with just correcting the paper is that the results as they are alongside numerous copies of the faulty paper have already gone so far that the public and the research community are liable to keep being exposed to the original more than the follow-on if severe action isn’t taken.\nIt’s worth noting at this point that retraction notices are often not sufficiently detailed, and they frequently mislead about the quality of papers. For example, I mentioned this paper I dissected was retracted, but notice that the retraction notice barely touches on any of the material errors of fact in the paper and, instead, mentions honest errors. At a minimum, journals should publish a log of what happened during investigations into papers that got retracted.\n14\n\nThe rewards for replication and the penalties for failed replication are also not that large.",

But that is all too frequently not what they do. Many civil servants act in their own personal and ideological interests, at a cost to the nation, and in counterproductive defiance of presidents with whom they&#8217;re not ideologically aligned.</p><p>The first Trump administration (&#8220;<em>Trump I</em>&#8221;) was chronically frustrated by the difficulties it had staffing the government with loyal employees. As a result, disloyal civil servants exploited the opportunity to build up an impressive track record materially harming the operational integrity of <em>Trump I.</em> There are examples aplenty of how<em>, </em>but for this essay, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250118202527/https://americafirstpolicy.com/assets/uploads/files/Tales_from_the_Swamp-_How_Federal_Bureaucrats_Resisted_President_Trump_-_Revided_1.8.2025.pdf\">a few James Sherk documented</a> should suffice:</p><ul><li><p>Career employees in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division refused to prosecute cases they ideologically disagreed with, even when the facts showed clear legal violations. This included Civil Rights Division career staff refusing to work on cases charging Yale University for racial discrimination against Asian-Americans and protecting nurses from being forced to participate in abortions.</p></li><li><p>Career staff at the Department of Education assigned to work on politically sensitive regulations, including the Title IX due process regulations, would either produce legally unusable drafts that would never withstand judicial review or drafts that significantly diverged from the Department&#8217;s policy goals. As a result, political appointees had to draft the regulations primarily by themselves.</p></li><li><p>Department of Health and Human Services career staff circumvented President Trump&#8217;s hiring freeze issued soon after taking office by crossing out new hires&#8217; start dates on their hiring paperwork. Staff used Sharpie pens to retroactively adjust the start dates to January 19, 2017&#8212;the day before President Trump took office.</p></li><li><p>Career lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board routinely gave political appointees misleading legal analyses. They would only cite cases supporting their preferred position and omit contrary precedents. Some career lawyers refused to draft documents whose positions they disagreed with.</p></li><li><p>Career attorneys in the Environmental Protection Agency did not inform political appointees about major cases the agency was involved in or the government&#8217;s positions in pending cases. Political appointees had to monitor public court filings to learn what the agency was doing.</p></li><li><p>Department of Labor regulatory staff intentionally delayed producing a departmental priority regulation. A competent private sector attorney could have produced a draft regulation in two to three weeks. The team of about a dozen career staff claimed they needed a year to do so&#8212;a pace that amounted to each attorney in the unit writing less than one line of text a day.</p></li></ul><p>Career staff impeded <em>Trump I</em> by withholding information, refusing to implement policies, intentionally delaying and slow-walking orders, deliberately underperforming, leaking private information to Congress and members of the media, and acting in an outright insubordinate manner when the opportunity to harm the presidency presented itself.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Political Loyalty Matters</h3><p><em>Trump I</em> produced enough anecdotes about civil servant disloyalty that a book on them could rival the tax code. But, does it matter? Yes. <em>Trump I</em> really was beset by historically extreme loyalty troubles, and a review of the evidence on this matter suggests it mattered a lot.</p><p>For starters, across several countries and throughout multiple decades of data collection, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gove.12853\">bureaucrats are more satisfied with their jobs and more motivated to career out the duties of their positions when the party in power is the one that they politically prefer</a>. We should, at a minimum, expect this to affect how well bureaucrats do their jobs such that bureaucrats put in less (more) effort when they&#8217;re working for the opposition (party they support).</p><p>Consistent with the view that misaligned civil servants in fact do worse jobs, bureaucrats who are politically misaligned with the executive in power cost the government more in procurement (when governments purchase goods and services). Illustrating this relies on a few other things to keep in mind. Firstly, a slim majority of non-political civil servants have been Democrats since Clinton. This has remained true despite changes in the party of the president. Or stated differently, civil servants with a given party membership tend to remain employed between presidencies.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"798.6263736263736\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:851337,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xfvH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F053094f5-1ed0-4216-be2b-8ec8d9f42c86_2375x1581.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA20355\">Spenkuch et al. 2023, Figure 3</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Secondly, the costs of bureaucrats having a different party come in multiple forms. One form is direct cost overruns, where projects cost more than they&#8217;re initially proposed to. Another is delays, where projects take longer than they&#8217;re projected to. By leveraging the consistency of civil servant political affiliation and the inconsistency of presidential party, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3982/ECTA20355\">researchers were able to determine</a> that a procurement officer and a president sharing the same party was related to economically significant problems in both respects.</p><p>Misalignment increases costs by about 1% of initial contract values, or 6% of the average total overrun, which, in the sample, was about 19% on average. An aligned procurement officer overseeing a contract is also about 1 percentage point less likely to see a cost overrun at all. Similarly, when contracts are managed by officers who are aligned for longer durations, they cost relatively less. These alignment impacts are also concentrated where contracts are more valuable and potentially among more complex contracts. But&#8212;critically&#8212;the effect of misalignment is comparable in size for Democratic and Republican civil servants.</p><p>Misalignment also increases delays, but it does not do so in general. The reason for this is that many contracts are short-term, and the impact of misalignment on delays for short-term contracts simply isn&#8217;t there, perhaps because it&#8217;s hard for it to be in the first place. For longer-term contracts, misalignment generates explains about 4% of the average delay in contract completion, and contracts do tend to be delayed. Some of the reasons for delays help to explain why short-term contracts aren&#8217;t affected. Long-term contracts have more opportunities to be modified, and both the probability of any modification and the total number of modifications are significantly increased when there&#8217;s civil servant misalignment. Additionally, the most severe form of contract modification&#8212;a premature cancellation&#8212;is likewise related to misalignment, in the expected direction.</p><p>All-in-all, these outcomes may sound unimpressive&#8212;a percentage point here, a few days there, etc. But, they add up. <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/blog/snapshot-government-wide-contracting-fy-2023-interactive-dashboard\">The Government Accountability Office reports that</a>, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government spent $759 billion on contracts. If they all took 5% less time to complete, were prematurely cancelled 2% less frequently, and cost 1% less, the savings would already be in the billions of dollars, and those are just the direct savings: they don&#8217;t speak to the benefits to businesses from the government being more reliable, the costs that can be saved by firing unnecessary civil servants if these problems are fixed, or the ways other workloads can be better managed by cutting down on unnecessary work for existing bureaucrats. This direct number might be a drop in the bucket for the federal budget, but it represents so much more than that, because it is just one part of one route to slowing down the government and making it less effective and efficient. This one aspect of misalignment costs is a small fraction of the total cost we all must bear due to politically disgruntled federal employees.</p><p>Data from several agencies affirms that the importance of loyalty also goes beyond effects on civil servant work ethic and even permeates to the private sector. For example, at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the partisan alignment of the executive impacts investigations and Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAER). <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4789073\">Firms that are politically misaligned with the executive in power suffer through greater numbers of investigations and they face higher penalties</a>. Otherwise comparable firms with different political alignments also have divergent fates when it comes to investigations after the SEC changes political hands. In <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jleo/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/jleo/ewae019/7742792\">one article</a>, it was estimated that a change in partisan alignment led to a nearly 20% reduction in the odds of newly-aligned firms being targeted for enforcement actions. Findings like these have probably become stronger in more recent years as well, since <a href=\"https://rady.ucsd.edu/faculty/directory/engelberg/pub/portfolios/PARTISAN_REGULATORS.pdf\">the SEC has become a more partisan institution</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>A Message From My Sponsor</em></h3><p>Steve Jobs is quoted as saying, &#8220;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

Change</h3><p>Though most civil servants and, indeed, most people are politically faithful throughout their lives, loyalty to a given party is by no means universal. Some number of civil servants do change the party they&#8217;re loyal to over the course of their careers. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/im-a-survivor-political-dynamics-in-bureaucratic-elites-partisan-identification/DD351EF101B469050EB26720ACB88746\">after a partisan shift in the elected principals of an agency, many existing agency leaders </a><em><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/im-a-survivor-political-dynamics-in-bureaucratic-elites-partisan-identification/DD351EF101B469050EB26720ACB88746\">do </a></em><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/im-a-survivor-political-dynamics-in-bureaucratic-elites-partisan-identification/DD351EF101B469050EB26720ACB88746\">reorient their partisan identities</a>. Furthermore, the greater the contact with the elected principal, the higher the likelihood of a switch.</p><p>The finding of some level of allegiance instability may actually help to explain the graph of civil servant affiliations above as, in this dataset, &#8220;14.5% of civil servants change from either Democrat or Republican to Independent, or from Independent to Democrat or Republican&#8221; while the &#8220;remaining 1.9% shifts between the two major parties&#8221;. Not to oversell this, however, do note that individuals who switch to being Independents tend to remain ideologically aligned to their party of origin, they tend to just drop party labels.</p><p>At the broader, system level, civil servant allegiances change more through changes in the composition of applicant pools.<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.13889\"> Individuals who are perturbed by a given regime will tend to be less likely to seek employment in it</a>, forgoing a government career for ideological reasons of their own. Over time, this adds up, and members of a party can be isolated from the government less because they were ousted or discriminated against in hiring from the outset, and more because they didn&#8217;t want to participate when the opportunity was there.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>Civil Service Protections Favor Democrats and Stasis</h3><p>Civil servants currently enjoy a level of protection from firing for misconduct and poor work that&#8217;s practically unparalleled in history and certainly in most of the private sector. With that in mind, the aforementioned largely Democratic composition of the federal bureaucracy means Republicans are at a disadvantage when it comes to governing.

Therefore, Republicans face a serious issue: if they cannot reform the civil service, they will never be able to govern as effectively as equally determined Democrats.

A new regime does not have the power to simply void each rule and regulation passed during the midnight period between regimes by fiat; they are constrained by the capabilities of the civil servants working for them, loyal or otherwise.</p><p>The combination of outgoing regimes stacking the books and Democrats having a greater ability to un-stack them, to stack them in the first place, and so on is a pernicious one, and it will harm <em>Trump II</em> like it harmed <em>Trump I</em>. This is much worse than it sounds on the surface precisely because of these compounding effects. Due to the regulatory morass that they face and the lack of institutional experience they have to contend with, Republicans are often left in total ignorance about what they are allowed to do. Consider this particularly jarring incident from the Department of Labor (DOL) under <em>Trump I </em>(<em>via </em>Sherk):</p><blockquote><p>Career employees at DOL consistently told political appointees they could not take actions that were in fact within their legal discretion. One career employee repeatedly told political appointees that they could not issue Direct Final Rules (DFR)&#8212;a method of issuing rules without going through notice-and-comment proceedings. On the first day of the Biden administration, DOL used a DFR to rescind internal regulations governing DOL&#8217;s rulemaking process.

The solution was to fully exploit a provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. This provision exempts civil service protections from employees determined to be in confidential policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating roles, creating a civil service that serves at the pleasure of the president. This new appointment classification was dubbed Schedule F, and it creates at-will employment in the excepted service.</p><p>The benefits of Schedule F to President Trump are immense. Instead of having to deal with disloyal bureaucrats, numerous policymakers who should be carrying out the will of the president but who instead resist his calls to action can be reclassified and let go. In effect, through the implementation of Schedule F, the federal government becomes more centralized under the direct control of the president, with much more power to both fire and hire employees to serve the regime.</p><p>Proponents allege that this brings the civil service back to the achieving <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20230019\">the lofty goals of the Pendleton Act</a>&#8212;that is, a civil service free of political interference, but nonetheless accountable to the people. But opponents claim it&#8217;ll be ineffective and subject to abuse.</p><p>Some Schedule F opponents contend that Schedule F effectively creates patronage networks and, indeed, that was the view expressed by Democrat representative Gerry Connolly when he tried unsuccessfully to sneak the &#8220;Preventing a Patronage System Act&#8221; into the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2023. <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/regulation/spring-2024/schedule-f-phantom-menace\">Others hold</a> that Trump will not realize the promise of Schedule F because his advisors Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita appear to have roundly rejected the various conservative staffing initiatives that popped up between 2020 and today. The claim there is that, without said efforts, Trump will not be able to fill the Schedule F slots he creates.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a></p><p>Opponents have deluded themselves into thinking that Schedule F will be harmful because they maintain a rosy view of the existing civil service, seeing them as nonpartisan and productive, when that cannot be further from the case. But in line with this view, they have frustrated Schedule F&#8217;s existence and future implementation. The first such stab against Schedule F was when Biden repealed it in its entirety shortly after coming into office, with Executive Order 14003. This Order was effected without problem because, by that point, no one had been rescheduled.</p><p>In April 2024, Biden&#8217;s administration adopted a regulation to provide rescheduled employees with their existing job protections, making Schedule F classification meaningless. Fortunately for <em>Trump II</em>, this can be repealed, it will just take time. Unfortunately, the effort to repeal and implement will result in lawsuits aplenty from civil servants and advocacy groups, so Trump&#8217;s realized governance will emerge at a minimum several months after he has entered office. These roadblocks take the punch out of the &#8216;First 100 Days&#8217; presidencies so often laud because <em>Trump II</em> will be handcuffed until these regulations are overturned and accompanying lawsuits are defeated.</p><p>Perhaps opponents of Schedule F have good news for Trump: <a href=\"https://archive.md/PsGEq\">many worry </a><em><a href=\"https://archive.md/PsGEq\">Trump II</a></em><a href=\"https://archive.md/PsGEq\"> will be able to put Schedule F into place promptly</a>!</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>Trump II</em> Has a Critical Moment</h3><p>There is a short period in which <em>Trump II</em> can prove to be highly-effective. The incoming administration must choose whether it wants to govern well immediately, because it only has one shot to do so. Specifically, <em>Trump II</em> has two years&#8212;until midterms. If President Trump cannot win or hold in the midterms, then it won&#8217;t become easier to govern; roadblocks will, if anything, increase, and the odds of a longer period of excellent governance under another Republican will drop in lockstep.</p><p>To seize the moment, Trump must rapidly wrest control of the Office of Personnel Management from the hostile actors standing in the way of Schedule F. The rhetoric on civil servants put forward by Russell Vought should become the standard line for this period. For the unfamiliar, Vought&#8212;the Office of Management and Budget Director nominee&#8212;has stated that he wants civil servants to feel &#8220;trauma&#8221; and to &#8220;wake up in the morning&#8221; not wanting to &#8220;go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.&#8221; This is violent rhetoric, but it&#8217;s the sort of attitude that needs to be common in order to gain control of the government.</p><p>What this means in practice is less intimidation and harassment and more resolving principal-agent problems. Republicans need to learn from Democrats and create ways to gather data. Data is a precious commodity that allows problems to be detected and attacked. For example, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1856790092578525303\">reforming the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System</a> would make it trivial to prosecute colleges and universities for discriminating against White and Asian students and violating the law on affirmative action. Similarly, creating data feeds that track the progress of the daily work of employees such as IT specialists and Freedom of Information Act officers could allow the discovery of misaligned employees in need of reclassification to Schedule F. Wherever these problems can be discovered through simple and cheap data gathering, they should be, accelerating the transition towards effective, drama-free governance.</p><p>Once the data is available to determine where problems remain, and the ability to handle it is implemented, it becomes time for Trump to hire and fire. Trump must leverage the enormous rolls of potential staffers that have been brought forward to his team, and he must fill the government with them. Once he does, he has to ensure his higher-level appointees do a good enough job directing them. This is critical: Trump must be like FDR, he must become a trusting and frequent delegator, even though his first term rightly led to trust issues with his staff.</p><p>From there, Trump has to push the big items that his team has on the menu so as to obtain as much short-term success as possible. The Trump team has plans that can be implemented immediately which could reduce Americans&#8217; insurance premiums by double-digit percentages; the Trump team could score foreign policy victories aplenty that Biden&#8217;s team was afraid to touch; the Trump team could revive supersonic air travel by implementing a one-paragraph rule; the Trump team could ask the Department of Justice to settle cases in favor of deregulating important industries like nuclear power; the Trump team could immediately make America the shining light for scientific progress and openness with a handful of simple reforms at the NIH, NSF, DOE, and CDC; and more.</p><p>There is so much on the table that would materially improve Americans&#8217; well-being overnight, and if the idea is to govern effectively for the whole four years and beyond, those items must come first and foremost. Or <em>Trump II</em> will be stuck, accumulating problems and resent, creating the same sorts of drama that befell <em>Trump I</em>.</p><p>But it needn&#8217;t be this way. <em>Trump II</em> can succeed, <strong>if it seizes this critical moment.</strong></p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The dynamics of federal agency composition <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07343469.2024.2338286\">can also be driven by competition between Congress and the Presidency</a>, but I suspect this has a smaller impact on applicants than the deterrent effect of being politically misaligned.</p></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-2\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-2\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is the strongest argument against Schedule F and, indeed, <em>Trump II </em>in general, succeeding.

Given the limited number of conservatives willing, able, and volunteering to join the government relative to the number of slots already available for appointment much less those available after the more than 10-fold expansion with Schedule F in place, this is practically inevitable.</p><p>But, pace, because many of the appointees announced thus far are decidedly on board with various staffing initiatives and, indeed, in several cases, took part in them.</p></div></div>",

      "script_text": "This post is brought to you by my sponsor, Warp.\nThis is the tenth in a series of timed posts. The way these work is that if it takes me more than one hour to complete the post, an applet that I made deletes everything I’ve written so far and I abandon the post. Check out previous examples here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. I placed the advertisement before I started my writing timer.\n\nWith a new Trump administration over the horizon, it’s a good time to discuss some facts about the federal bureaucrats and appointees who will be working with President Trump to bring about his administration’s goals.\n\nTrump I Had Legitimate Loyalty Issues\nCivil servants are nominally intended to operate in the interests of the United States rather than in the interests of president or party. But that is all too frequently not what they do. Many civil servants act in their own personal and ideological interests, at a cost to the nation, and in counterproductive defiance of presidents with whom they’re not ideologically aligned.\nThe first Trump administration (“ Trump I ”) was chronically frustrated by the difficulties it had staffing the government with loyal employees. As a result, disloyal civil servants exploited the opportunity to build up an impressive track record materially harming the operational integrity of Trump I. There are examples aplenty of how, but for this essay, a few James Sherk documented should suffice:\n\nCareer employees in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division refused to prosecute cases they ideologically disagreed with, even when the facts showed clear legal violations. This included Civil Rights Division career staff refusing to work on cases charging Yale University for racial discrimination against Asian-Americans and protecting nurses from being forced to participate in abortions.\n\nCareer staff at the Department of Education assigned to work on politically sensitive regulations, including the Title IX due process regulations, would either produce legally unusable drafts that would never withstand judicial review or drafts that significantly diverged from the Department’s policy goals. As a result, political appointees had to draft the regulations primarily by themselves.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services career staff circumvented President Trump’s hiring freeze issued soon after taking office by crossing out new hires’ start dates on their hiring paperwork. Staff used Sharpie pens to retroactively adjust the start dates to January 19, 2017—the day before President Trump took office.\n\nCareer lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board routinely gave political appointees misleading legal analyses. They would only cite cases supporting their preferred position and omit contrary precedents. Some career lawyers refused to draft documents whose positions they disagreed with.\n\nCareer attorneys in the Environmental Protection Agency did not inform political appointees about major cases the agency was involved in or the government’s positions in pending cases. Political appointees had to monitor public court filings to learn what the agency was doing.\n\nDepartment of Labor regulatory staff intentionally delayed producing a departmental priority regulation. A competent private sector attorney could have produced a draft regulation in two to three weeks. The team of about a dozen career staff claimed they needed a year to do so—a pace that amounted to each attorney in the unit writing less than one line of text a day.\nCareer staff impeded Trump I by withholding information, refusing to implement policies, intentionally delaying and slow-walking orders, deliberately underperforming, leaking private information to Congress and members of the media, and acting in an outright insubordinate manner when the opportunity to harm the presidency presented itself.\n\nPolitical Loyalty Matters\nTrump I produced enough anecdotes about civil servant disloyalty that a book on them could rival the tax code. But, does it matter? Yes. Trump I really was beset by historically extreme loyalty troubles, and a review of the evidence on this matter suggests it mattered a lot.\nFor starters, across several countries and throughout multiple decades of data collection, bureaucrats are more satisfied with their jobs and more motivated to career out the duties of their positions when the party in power is the one that they politically prefer. We should, at a minimum, expect this to affect how well bureaucrats do their jobs such that bureaucrats put in less (more) effort when they’re working for the opposition (party they support).\nConsistent with the view that misaligned civil servants in fact do worse jobs, bureaucrats who are politically misaligned with the executive in power cost the government more in procurement (when governments purchase goods and services). Illustrating this relies on a few other things to keep in mind. Firstly, a slim majority of non-political civil servants have been Democrats since Clinton. This has remained true despite changes in the party of the president. Or stated differently, civil servants with a given party membership tend to remain employed between presidencies.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSpenkuch et al. 2023, Figure 3\nSecondly, the costs of bureaucrats having a different party come in multiple forms. One form is direct cost overruns, where projects cost more than they’re initially proposed to. Another is delays, where projects take longer than they’re projected to. By leveraging the consistency of civil servant political affiliation and the inconsistency of presidential party, researchers were able to determine that a procurement officer and a president sharing the same party was related to economically significant problems in both respects.\nMisalignment increases costs by about 1% of initial contract values, or 6% of the average total overrun, which, in the sample, was about 19% on average. An aligned procurement officer overseeing a contract is also about 1 percentage point less likely to see a cost overrun at all. Similarly, when contracts are managed by officers who are aligned for longer durations, they cost relatively less. These alignment impacts are also concentrated where contracts are more valuable and potentially among more complex contracts. But—critically—the effect of misalignment is comparable in size for Democratic and Republican civil servants.\nMisalignment also increases delays, but it does not do so in general. The reason for this is that many contracts are short-term, and the impact of misalignment on delays for short-term contracts simply isn’t there, perhaps because it’s hard for it to be in the first place. For longer-term contracts, misalignment generates explains about 4% of the average delay in contract completion, and contracts do tend to be delayed. Some of the reasons for delays help to explain why short-term contracts aren’t affected. Long-term contracts have more opportunities to be modified, and both the probability of any modification and the total number of modifications are significantly increased when there’s civil servant misalignment. Additionally, the most severe form of contract modification—a premature cancellation—is likewise related to misalignment, in the expected direction.\nAll-in-all, these outcomes may sound unimpressive—a percentage point here, a few days there, etc. But, they add up. The Government Accountability Office reports that, in the 2023 fiscal year, the federal government spent $759 billion on contracts. If they all took 5% less time to complete, were prematurely cancelled 2% less frequently, and cost 1% less, the savings would already be in the billions of dollars, and those are just the direct savings: they don’t speak to the benefits to businesses from the government being more reliable, the costs that can be saved by firing unnecessary civil servants if these problems are fixed, or the ways other workloads can be better managed by cutting down on unnecessary work for existing bureaucrats. This direct number might be a drop in the bucket for the federal budget, but it represents so much more than that, because it is just one part of one route to slowing down the government and making it less effective and efficient. This one aspect of misalignment costs is a small fraction of the total cost we all must bear due to politically disgruntled federal employees.\nData from several agencies affirms that the importance of loyalty also goes beyond effects on civil servant work ethic and even permeates to the private sector. For example, at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the partisan alignment of the executive impacts investigations and Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAER). Firms that are politically misaligned with the executive in power suffer through greater numbers of investigations and they face higher penalties. Otherwise comparable firms with different political alignments also have divergent fates when it comes to investigations after the SEC changes political hands. In one article, it was estimated that a change in partisan alignment led to a nearly 20% reduction in the odds of newly-aligned firms being targeted for enforcement actions. Findings like these have probably become stronger in more recent years as well, since the SEC has become a more partisan institution.\n\nA Message From My Sponsor\nSteve Jobs is quoted as saying, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Few B2B SaaS companies take this as seriously as Warp, the payroll and compliance platform used by based founders and startups.\nWarp has cut out all the features you don’t need (looking at you, Gusto’s “e-Welcome” card for new employees) and has automated the ones you do: federal, state, and local tax compliance, global contractor payments, and 5-minute onboarding.\nIn other words, Warp saves you enough time that you’ll stop having the intrusive thoughts suggesting you might actually need to make your first Human Resources hire.\nGet started now at joinwarp.com/crem and get a $1,000 Amazon gift card when you run payroll for the first time.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nGet Started Now: www.joinwarp.com/crem\n\nAllegiances Change\nThough most civil servants and, indeed, most people are politically faithful throughout their lives, loyalty to a given party is by no means universal. Some number of civil servants do change the party they’re loyal to over the course of their careers. Indeed, after a partisan shift in the elected principals of an agency, many existing agency leaders do reorient their partisan identities. Furthermore, the greater the contact with the elected principal, the higher the likelihood of a switch.\nThe finding of some level of allegiance instability may actually help to explain the graph of civil servant affiliations above as, in this dataset, “14.5% of civil servants change from either Democrat or Republican to Independent, or from Independent to Democrat or Republican” while the “remaining 1.9% shifts between the two major parties”. Not to oversell this, however, do note that individuals who switch to being Independents tend to remain ideologically aligned to their party of origin, they tend to just drop party labels.\nAt the broader, system level, civil servant allegiances change more through changes in the composition of applicant pools. Individuals who are perturbed by a given regime will tend to be less likely to seek employment in it, forgoing a government career for ideological reasons of their own. Over time, this adds up, and members of a party can be isolated from the government less because they were ousted or discriminated against in hiring from the outset, and more because they didn’t want to participate when the opportunity was there. 1\n\nCivil Service Protections Favor Democrats and Stasis\nCivil servants currently enjoy a level of protection from firing for misconduct and poor work that’s practically unparalleled in history and certainly in most of the private sector. With that in mind, the aforementioned largely Democratic composition of the federal bureaucracy means Republicans are at a disadvantage when it comes to governing. The competitive career service is mostly Democrats:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSpenkuch et al. 2023, Figure A.4a\nThe career Senior Executive Service is mostly Democrats:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSpenkuch et al. 2023, Figure A.4b\nAnd a plurality of nonpolitical excepted service officials are Democrats:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nSpenkuch et al. 2023, Figure A.4c\nThe unavoidable conclusion of this Democratic overrepresentation in the government and the inability to push them out is that, if Democrats (Republicans) want to govern, they’re more (less) likely to get their governing done, because the officials will tend to be more (less) compliant. Therefore, Republicans face a serious issue: if they cannot reform the civil service, they will never be able to govern as effectively as equally determined Democrats. Frankly, given the resistance Republicans are likely to face, that’s probably being too generous since it’s unreasonable to assume Republicans will manage to stay as determined as Democrats given the greater level of resistance they have to deal with.\n\nOutgoing Administrations Stack the Books\nAfter the Carter presidency, when a presidency ends, its staffers make every effort to flood the Federal Register with novel rules and regulations. The number of pages that are published in the period between losing an election and an opponent’s inauguration represents a staggering break from the trend during a given president’s tenure.\nRecalling that Republicans are at a disadvantage in civil servant numbers, and civil servants who are misaligned act disobediently, it becomes apparent that the time required to purge or even to understand these regulations is going to be greater for Republicans. A new regime does not have the power to simply void each rule and regulation passed during the midnight period between regimes by fiat; they are constrained by the capabilities of the civil servants working for them, loyal or otherwise.\nThe combination of outgoing regimes stacking the books and Democrats having a greater ability to un-stack them, to stack them in the first place, and so on is a pernicious one, and it will harm Trump II like it harmed Trump I. This is much worse than it sounds on the surface precisely because of these compounding effects. Due to the regulatory morass that they face and the lack of institutional experience they have to contend with, Republicans are often left in total ignorance about what they are allowed to do. Consider this particularly jarring incident from the Department of Labor (DOL) under Trump I( via Sherk):\n\nCareer employees at DOL consistently told political appointees they could not take actions that were in fact within their legal discretion. One career employee repeatedly told political appointees that they could not issue Direct Final Rules (DFR)—a method of issuing rules without going through notice-and-comment proceedings. On the first day of the Biden administration, DOL used a DFR to rescind internal regulations governing DOL’s rulemaking process. That DFR was signed by a career staffer who repeatedly told Trump political appointees, “you can never do a DFR.”\nUnfortunately for Trump and fortunately for this traitorous civil servant, there is no punishment for lying about how the government is run to slow down your ideological enemies.\n\nDemocrats Have Created Barriers to Trump Governing\nNear the end of Trump I, a solution to the problem of structural Republican federal governance disadvantage was laid out by James Sherk and subsequently enacted by President Trump via Executive Order 13957 on October 21, 2020. The solution was to fully exploit a provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act. This provision exempts civil service protections from employees determined to be in confidential policy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating roles, creating a civil service that serves at the pleasure of the president. This new appointment classification was dubbed Schedule F, and it creates at-will employment in the excepted service.\nThe benefits of Schedule F to President Trump are immense. Instead of having to deal with disloyal bureaucrats, numerous policymakers who should be carrying out the will of the president but who instead resist his calls to action can be reclassified and let go. In effect, through the implementation of Schedule F, the federal government becomes more centralized under the direct control of the president, with much more power to both fire and hire employees to serve the regime.\nProponents allege that this brings the civil service back to the achieving the lofty goals of the Pendleton Act —that is, a civil service free of political interference, but nonetheless accountable to the people. But opponents claim it’ll be ineffective and subject to abuse.\nSome Schedule F opponents contend that Schedule F effectively creates patronage networks and, indeed, that was the view expressed by Democrat representative Gerry Connolly when he tried unsuccessfully to sneak the “Preventing a Patronage System Act” into the National Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2023. Others hold that Trump will not realize the promise of Schedule F because his advisors Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita appear to have roundly rejected the various conservative staffing initiatives that popped up between 2020 and today. The claim there is that, without said efforts, Trump will not be able to fill the Schedule F slots he creates. 2\nOpponents have deluded themselves into thinking that Schedule F will be harmful because they maintain a rosy view of the existing civil service, seeing them as nonpartisan and productive, when that cannot be further from the case. But in line with this view, they have frustrated Schedule F’s existence and future implementation. The first such stab against Schedule F was when Biden repealed it in its entirety shortly after coming into office, with Executive Order 14003. This Order was effected without problem because, by that point, no one had been rescheduled.\nIn April 2024, Biden’s administration adopted a regulation to provide rescheduled employees with their existing job protections, making Schedule F classification meaningless. Fortunately for Trump II, this can be repealed, it will just take time. Unfortunately, the effort to repeal and implement will result in lawsuits aplenty from civil servants and advocacy groups, so Trump’s realized governance will emerge at a minimum several months after he has entered office. These roadblocks take the punch out of the ‘First 100 Days’ presidencies so often laud because Trump II will be handcuffed until these regulations are overturned and accompanying lawsuits are defeated.\nPerhaps opponents of Schedule F have good news for Trump: many worry Trump II will be able to put Schedule F into place promptly!\n\nTrump II Has a Critical Moment\nThere is a short period in which Trump II can prove to be highly-effective. The incoming administration must choose whether it wants to govern well immediately, because it only has one shot to do so. Specifically, Trump II has two years—until midterms. If President Trump cannot win or hold in the midterms, then it won’t become easier to govern; roadblocks will, if anything, increase, and the odds of a longer period of excellent governance under another Republican will drop in lockstep.\nTo seize the moment, Trump must rapidly wrest control of the Office of Personnel Management from the hostile actors standing in the way of Schedule F. The rhetoric on civil servants put forward by Russell Vought should become the standard line for this period. For the unfamiliar, Vought—the Office of Management and Budget Director nominee—has stated that he wants civil servants to feel “trauma” and to “wake up in the morning” not wanting to “go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” This is violent rhetoric, but it’s the sort of attitude that needs to be common in order to gain control of the government.\nWhat this means in practice is less intimidation and harassment and more resolving principal-agent problems. Republicans need to learn from Democrats and create ways to gather data. Data is a precious commodity that allows problems to be detected and attacked. For example, reforming the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System would make it trivial to prosecute colleges and universities for discriminating against White and Asian students and violating the law on affirmative action. Similarly, creating data feeds that track the progress of the daily work of employees such as IT specialists and Freedom of Information Act officers could allow the discovery of misaligned employees in need of reclassification to Schedule F. Wherever these problems can be discovered through simple and cheap data gathering, they should be, accelerating the transition towards effective, drama-free governance.\nOnce the data is available to determine where problems remain, and the ability to handle it is implemented, it becomes time for Trump to hire and fire. Trump must leverage the enormous rolls of potential staffers that have been brought forward to his team, and he must fill the government with them. Once he does, he has to ensure his higher-level appointees do a good enough job directing them. This is critical: Trump must be like FDR, he must become a trusting and frequent delegator, even though his first term rightly led to trust issues with his staff.\nFrom there, Trump has to push the big items that his team has on the menu so as to obtain as much short-term success as possible. The Trump team has plans that can be implemented immediately which could reduce Americans’ insurance premiums by double-digit percentages; the Trump team could score foreign policy victories aplenty that Biden’s team was afraid to touch; the Trump team could revive supersonic air travel by implementing a one-paragraph rule; the Trump team could ask the Department of Justice to settle cases in favor of deregulating important industries like nuclear power; the Trump team could immediately make America the shining light for scientific progress and openness with a handful of simple reforms at the NIH, NSF, DOE, and CDC; and more.\nThere is so much on the table that would materially improve Americans’ well-being overnight, and if the idea is to govern effectively for the whole four years and beyond, those items must come first and foremost. Or Trump II will be stuck, accumulating problems and resent, creating the same sorts of drama that befell Trump I.\nBut it needn’t be this way. Trump II can succeed, if it seizes this critical moment.\n1\n\nThe dynamics of federal agency composition can also be driven by competition between Congress and the Presidency, but I suspect this has a smaller impact on applicants than the deterrent effect of being politically misaligned.\n2\n\nThis is the strongest argument against Schedule F and, indeed, Trump II in general, succeeding. It cannot be taken lightly. If the Trump team fails to exploit the lists of staffers produced by the various pro-Trump staffing initiatives, it will almost-certainly fail because it will run into the same staffing issues experienced during Trump I. Given the limited number of conservatives willing, able, and volunteering to join the government relative to the number of slots already available for appointment much less those available after the more than 10-fold expansion with Schedule F in place, this is practically inevitable.\nBut, pace, because many of the appointees announced thus far are decidedly on board with various staffing initiatives and, indeed, in several cases, took part in them.",

href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-02309-000\">IQ and the Wealth of Nations</a></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The figures in this map are derived from a raft of studies compiled by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen in their 2002 book <em><a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-02309-000\">IQ and the Wealth of Nations</a></em>. The book itself is little more than a compilation and discussion of these studies, all of which are IQ estimates from samples located in different countries or based on diasporas (e.g., refugees) from those countries.</p><p><strong>To get this out of the way, the estimates from </strong><em><strong>IQ and the Wealth of Nations </strong></em><strong>hold up.</strong> They are replicable and they are meaningful. At the same time, they are contentious. Lynn and Vanhanen&#8217;s estimates have many detractors, but virtually all of the negative arguments have one thing in common: they&#8217;re based on the idea that the estimates <em>feel wrong</em>, rather than with any actual inaccuracies with them.</p><p>Let&#8217;s review.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;Countries Can&#8217;t Have Mean IQs in the 70s!&#8221;</h3><p>One of the most common arguments against Lynn and Vanhanen&#8217;s national IQ estimates is that it is simply impossible for whole countries&#8217; mean IQs to be what people often consider to be so low that they&#8217;re considered <em>prima facie</em> evidence of mental retardation. This feeling is based on misconceptions about how mental retardation is diagnosed and defined, and misunderstandings about the meanings of very low IQs across populations. Let&#8217;s tackle definition first.</p><p>The belief that mental retardation is defined by an IQ threshold is similar to many of the arguments against the validity of national IQs in that it is based on a failure to give even a cursory thought to one&#8217;s own arguments. It&#8217;s a belief that cannot survive reading the latest version of the DSM, or for that matter, thinking of psychologists as competent people. If you open up the DSM-5 and turn to the section entitled <em>Intellectual Disabilities, </em>the first thing you see is the diagnostic criteria, which read as follows:</p><blockquote><p>The following three criteria must be met:</p><ol><li><p>Deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.</p></li><li><p>Deficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.</p></li><li><p>Onset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.</p></li></ol></blockquote><p>There are four listed severity levels for mental retardation, <em>Mild, Moderate, Severe, </em>and <em>Profound</em>, and they are &#8220;defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not IQ scores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required. Moreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range.&#8221; It&#8217;s true that <a href=\"https://archive.md/HYHUs#selection-11045.148-11081.12\">most mentally retarded people have IQs in the range of 55 to 70</a>, so it&#8217;s easy to get misled into thinking that IQ is the defining factor for mental retardation. But an IQ of about 70 and below only indicates (but doesn&#8217;t diagnose) mental retardation because of what it tends to be caused by in certain populations. This is a roundabout way of saying that a low IQ indicates mental retardation because of what it means for a person's behavior, which, I'll explain, covaries with its causes.</p><p>IQs are mostly normally distributed, and IQs represent the influences of multiple different constructs and causes, but <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016028961630201X\">they primarily reflect differences in general intelligence</a>. At the same time, there&#8217;s a major deviation from normality at the lower end of the scale. If you sample well enough, the picture you&#8217;d get would look like this:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png\" width=\"1213\" height=\"593\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:593,&quot;width&quot;:1213,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:123776,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!rs8p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe41dabd7-0fee-4e2c-bc12-f6cf45786c71_1213x593.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://arthurjensen.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/How-Much-Can-We-Boost-IQ-and-Scholastic-Achievement-OCR.pdf\">Jensen, 1969</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>The reason is that there are the normal-range causes that produce the traditional bell curve, and then there are extreme circumstances that produce extraordinarily low IQs.

And that makes sense! Your wrench in the gears is likely to break something, not to increase efficiency. If you hit someone in the head hard enough, you can reduce their IQ score, but not in a million years will you turn them into von Neumann.</p><p>The reason someone's IQ drops after you bludgeon them is more singular and specific than the reasons IQ varies in the general population. A hit to the noggin may leave someone unable to flex their short-term memory, even if their visuospatial rotation capabilities are unaffected. There's some degree of isolation of function and compensation for deficits in the brain. We know this thanks to many observations, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289621000659\">like on the effects of neural lesions</a>.</p><p>When we say that someone with an IQ of &#8804;70 is mentally retarded, we're saying that they lack adaptive behavior&#8212;that they're not very bright, and so it makes living life hard. When someone with an IQ &gt;70 is mentally retarded&#8212;which happens!&#8212;we&#8217;re saying the same thing. But if a population legitimately has a mean IQ of 70 (and some do), we'll notice that they're not drooling troglodytes who can't put on their shoes. This is because the reasons for their low IQ are not things that cause specific and extreme deficits, but instead, things that cause normal-range variation, which is far less severe in nature than something that causes massive, specific, discontinuously-caused deficits.</p><p>Supposing discontinuous causes that create major, specific deficits yields testable consequences. We can see them play out clearly by leveraging different countries&#8217; population registers.</p><p>In large Israeli (B) and Swedish (A) datasets, we can see that when a person has a mild intellectual disability, their sibling tends to be less intelligent too. You also see this for heights, autism, or any other highly polygenic trait. This is expected with continuously distributed causes because siblings share portions of their genetic endowments.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2

In some cases, you wouldn't even recognize them as being \"retarded\" because they have conditions like amnesia, where the person is clearly odd and unfortunate, and they score poorly on an IQ test, but they might sound totally coherent otherwise.</p><p>Normal-range causes lead to linear changes in adaptive behavior; idiopathic mental retardation, leads to a discontinuous decrease in adaptive behavior. </p><p>Accordingly, an IQ of 70 does not have the same meaning for members of different groups, since if a group with a mean IQ of 70 randomly pulls a person with an IQ of 70, they aren't likely to score like someone who's mentally retarded for idiopathic reasons. Arthur Jensen, incidentally, predicted this sort of result in his 1972 <em>Genetics and Education</em> based on some observations he made as an educator. </p><blockquote><p>My student said he was looking for a good culture-free or culture-fair test of intelligence and had not been able to find one. All the tests he used, whether they were claimed to be culture-fair or not, were in considerable agreement with respect to children diagnosed as educationally mentally retarded (EMR), by which they were assigned to special small classes offering a different instructional program from that in the regular classes. To qualify for this special treatment, children had to have IQs below 75 as well as lagging far behind their age-mates in scholastic performance. <strong>My student, who had examined many of these backward pupils himself, had gained the impression that the tests were quite valid in their assessments of white middle-class children but not of minority lower-class children.</strong></p><p><strong>Many of the latter, despite IQs below 75 and markedly poor scholastic performance, did not seem nearly as retarded as the white middle-class children with comparable IQs and scholastic records.</strong> <strong>Middle-class white children with IQs in the EMR range generally appeared more retarded than the minority children who were in special classes.</strong> Using nonverbal rather than verbal tests did not appreciably alter the problem. I confirmed my students observations for myself by observing EMR children in their classes and on the playground and by discussing their characteristics with a number of teachers and school psychologists. <strong>My student&#8217;s observations proved reliable.</strong></p><p><strong>EMR children who were called &#8216;culturally disadvantaged&#8217;, as contrasted with middle-class EMR children, appeared much brighter socially and on the playground, often being quite indistinguishable in every way from children of normal IQ except in their scholastic performance and in their scores on a variety of standard IQ tests.</strong> Middle-class white children diagnosed as EMR, on the other hand, though they constituted a much smaller percentage of the EMR classes, usually appeared to be more mentally retarded all round and not just in their performance in scholastic subjects and IQ tests. I asked myself, how could one devise a testing procedure that would reveal this distinction so that it could be brought under closer study and not depend upon casual observations and impressions.</p></blockquote><p>The distinction between types of mental retardation that are demarcated by their symptoms and, thus, by their causes, is important to understand. It's why an IQ of 70 for a Japanese person is likely to indicate an extraordinarily severe issue in need of attention, while for a Bushman, they won't have any trouble surviving. This is why the DSM-V notes in the <em>Diagnostic Features</em> section and bolded here: &#8220;The essential features of intellectual disability are deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion 1) and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning, <strong>in comparison to an individual&#8217;s age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched peers</strong> (Criterion 2).&#8221;</p><p>Keep that bolded part in mind and you&#8217;ll understand the importance of test norming and, knowing about discontinuous causes and the adaptive functioning deficit requirement for retardation diagnosis, you&#8217;ll never again be able to think that a mean IQ around 70 invalidates national IQs. But there&#8217;s another reason you shouldn&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s that you&#8217;re probably not an ultra-hereditarian.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010000348\">In 2010, Richard Lynn pointed out</a> that high IQs in Sub-Saharan Africa were incompatible with anything but the judgment that the group differences in the U.S. were <em>entirely </em>genetic in origin and even extremely poor environments <em>have no effects on cognitive development.</em> In response to an attempt to say that Sub-Saharan Africans had a mean IQ closer to 80 than 70, he wrote:</p><blockquote><p>[The] assumption that [some of these samples of] children had IQs of 85 and 88 seems improbable. These are the IQs of blacks in the United States. It can hardly be possible that blacks in the United States who have all the advantages of living in an economically developed country, with high income, good health care, good nutrition and education, would have the same IQ as blacks in impoverished Nigeria. If this were so, we would have to infer that these environmental disadvantages have no effect whatever on IQs and even the most hard line hereditarians would not go that far.</p></blockquote><p>Or, if you want to see this point made diagrammatically (courtesy of <a href=\"https://x.com/AnechoicMedia_\">X user AnechoicMedia</a>), here you are:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"Image\" title=\"Image\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!NMDl!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34211c73-35c5-486c-a6e6-864fc064b18f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Low IQs are also predictable from national development, making them that much more realistic.

To get around this issue, he exploited the fact that there&#8217;s spatial autocorrelation in order to provide imputed national IQs. Some people think, however, that these imputed IQs are <em>bad</em> and make his data <em>fake</em>, failing to realize that imputation is normal and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289608000202\">it doesn&#8217;t have meaningful effects on Lynn&#8217;s national IQ estimates</a>.</p><p>In the most recent dataset Lynn created before he died, his imputation procedure was <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">like so</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To calculate these imputations, Lynn and Becker (2019a, b) took advantage of the spatial autocorrelation that often exists in international data and identified the three countries with the longest land borders that had IQ means. A mean IQ, weighted by the length of the land border, was calculated and used as an estimate for the country&#8217;s missing estimated mean IQ. For island nations, the three closest countries with IQ data were identified, and an unweighted mean was calculated and imputed as an estimated mean IQ value for the missing country&#8217;s data.</p></blockquote><p>Geographic imputation of this sort is the responsible thing to do when data is not missing at random and it can be predicted from other values in the dataset, because more data means more power and, given the nature of the missingness, less bias. So whether Lynn was being responsible or irresponsible is a matter of how well the imputations hold up. Thankfully, they do hold up.</p><p>The simplest way to check the robustness of Lynn&#8217;s national IQs is to compare his imputed national IQs to subsequently sampled national IQs. I&#8217;ll do this with his much maligned 2002 and 2012 national IQs. To assess the validity of the imputed IQs I&#8217;ll correlate them with our <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/bx86g\">current best national IQs</a> and the World Bank HLOs.</p><p>Lynn&#8217;s 2002 imputed national IQs correlate at <em>r</em> = 0.90 with our current best national IQs and 0.72 with HLOs. 102 countries were imputed which we now have estimates for. Compared to our current best national IQs, 72 were overestimates and the average estimation error was 1.47 points upwards. The average overestimation on Lynn&#8217;s part was 3.71 points, and the average underestimation was 3.75 points. Since these were imputed countries, they don&#8217;t really reveal anything about Lynn&#8217;s estimation biases in general, as they&#8217;re a select subset of generally poor or small countries. Lynn&#8217;s 2012 imputed national IQs correlate at <em>r</em> = 0.92 with our current best national IQs and 0.76 with HLOs. 66 countries were imputed which we now have estimates for. Compared to our current best national IQs, 37 were overestimates and the average estimation error was 0.72 points upwards. The average overestimation on Lynn&#8217;s part was 3.48 points, and the average underestimation was 2.61 points.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a></p><p>I want to mention again that it should not be surprising that this procedure doesn&#8217;t really do much. It&#8217;s simple, straightforward, and scientifically uncontroversial, plus it&#8217;s theoretically sound, so it&#8217;s not shocking that it works. In a related domain, I found that this worked out just fine in the U.S.</p><p>I took the NAEP Black-White score gaps from the lower-48 and predicted them for each state from the observed gap for their immediate neighbors. The Michigan-Minnesota and New York-Rhode Island water borders were counted as neighboring state borders, and the result of imputing across state borders was a correlation of about 0.60 with the real gaps:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\"

If it were true, it would be easy to show rather than to merely assert.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-4\" href=\"#footnote-4\" target=\"_self\">4</a> To check this, just compare Lynn&#8217;s estimated national IQs to independent collections of national IQ estimates and see if they vary systematically and meaningfully. I&#8217;ve done this, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1831531274172760236\">with both our current best national IQs as the reference</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1831855224044355853\">using World Bank HLOs as reference</a>. The results are practically the same, but this should be unsurprising, since Lynn computed sets of national IQs based on IQ tests and based on achievement tests, and they were highly aligned. But I digress.

The degree of under- and over-estimation is minor, ranging between underestimating Sub-Saharan Africa by 1.89 points and overestimating Latin America by 4.21 points. Europe was overestimated by just 1.01 points, indicating no real evidence for the theory that Lynn favored Whites.

Without imputation, these numbers become 0.97 points of underestimation and, curiously, Europe is actually underestimated by 0.15 points.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800.2747252747253\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:478817,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7VwE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e37a535-52fc-40e2-9886-660101a78dd9_3600x2400.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>In addition to producing replicable estimates, the estimates Lynn produced also weren&#8217;t off by much in general. I don&#8217;t think this should be surprising, but some people have responded to this with the argument that&#8230;</p><h4>&#8220;Lynn&#8217;s Estimates Were Never Validated By Independent Data!&#8221;</h4><p>This is a response to the above that is, simply put, a complete lie. The idea here is that the above validation of Lynn&#8217;s national IQ estimates is based on looking only at permutations of Lynn&#8217;s national IQ estimates, derived largely from the same sets of studies. But there is only one way to arrive at that view, and it&#8217;s to simply assume it&#8217;s true without looking at the data to see that it&#8217;s clearly not.</p><p>The wonderful thing about Lynn&#8217;s data is that he documents all of his decisions and you can peruse his national IQ database, cutting out studies you don&#8217;t like and adjusting all the estimates accordingly. Reasonable changes to Lynn&#8217;s adjustments and inclusions don&#8217;t make a difference. The data is publicly available, so you can go and confirm that yourself. But an even simpler way to show that Lynn&#8217;s estimates hold up is to just see if they hold up in data that&#8217;s entirely non-overlapping with Lynn&#8217;s data.

Compared to HLOs, Lynn underestimated Sub-Saharan Africa by a piddling 5.03 points, but he also underestimated Europeans by 0.61 points, and overestimated Oceania, Latin America, and South Asia by 5.71, 2.74, and 5.89 points, respectively.</p><p>This is just not consistent with a pattern of strong, European-favoring misestimation, and if we drop Lynn&#8217;s imputations that becomes even clearer because the underestimation of Sub-Saharan Africa <em>increases </em>to 5.44 points, while the overestimation of Oceania, Latin America, and South Asia shift to 2.68, 1.97, and 1.92 points. And if we look at Lynn&#8217;s later 2012 national IQ estimates, the patterns just aren&#8217;t that different, a fact that&#8217;s true whether we subset HLOs to be derived completely beyond the dates of Lynn&#8217;s data or not.</p><p>So to summarize, unless everyone shares Lynn&#8217;s biases, then his national IQ estimates do not suggest he was biased in favor of Europeans. The impacts of his imputation methods also suggest that he wasn&#8217;t biased in that direction either.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;The Samples Lynn Used Were Often Very Poor!&#8221;</h3><p>A major argument that Lynn was in the wrong is that some of his samples were disadvantaged, underprivileged, or whatever other euphemisms you might wish to use for being poor, and that perhaps his samples from poor countries were worse in this respect, because he wanted them to look worse. This doesn&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny.</p><p>Lynn always caveated national IQs based on limited samples. Though you won&#8217;t see that if you just look at the resulting national IQ maps, you definitely see that if you look in his books describing what data was used, how it was gathered, and so on. It is true that some of Lynn&#8217;s referenced samples were very poor, but this always has to be considered in the light of representativeness. If poverty is the norm for a region, then samples <em>should be poor</em> to be representative. Similarly, if a health condition like <em>anemia</em> is the norm for a region&#8212;and in many places, it actually is!&#8212;then the best sample will have high rates of anemia, regardless of whether that&#8217;s &#8216;acceptable&#8217; for a sample from a developed Western country.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a></p><p>We can think about this in the context of a few sample means from poor places which we know to be psychometrically unbiased when compared with U.S. samples. In this case, <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1694794239605866923\">I&#8217;ll reference samples Russell Warne provided data on from Kenya and Ghana</a>.</p><p>The samples were from 1997 and 2015 and they used the WISC-III in Kenya and WAIS-IV in Ghana. The Kenyan test-takers came from grade 8 schools and the Ghanaian ones were public and private high schoolers from Accra, alongside a sample of university students. </p><p>The problem with this sampling is that education in Kenya in 1997 and Ghana in 2015 is nowhere near this level. In Kenya, most people didn't even reach grade 8 at the time, and in Ghana, most people don't reach university but university students were 57% of the sample! Furthermore, the Kenyan sample was from Nairobi, so it was at least sampled in what was, as of 2018, Kenya's 2nd-richest county and home to &lt;9% of the population. The situation was even less representative in Ghana, where the sample was from Accra and thus also &lt;9% of the population and a third of Ghana's GDP. </p><p>These samples were highly unrepresentative of their respective populations because they were relatively elite. The bias was not as bad in the Kenyan sample: they were one to two SDs above the country as a whole in socioeconomic status. But in Ghana, they were three to four SDs above the average. That's like comparing high school dropouts to college graduates. </p><p>Warne knew of this problem and wrote: </p><blockquote><p>As eighth-graders, the members of this sample were more educated than the average Kenyan. In 1997, the average Kenyan adult had 4.7 years of formal schooling; by 2019, this average had increased to 6.6 years.</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>Like the [Kenyan] sample, this [Ghanaian] sample is much more educated than the average person in the country. In 2015, the average Ghanaian adult had 7.8 years of schooling (which increased to 8.3 years by 2019), whereas 61% of [this sample] had 16 years of education or more.</p></blockquote><p>Knowing this, mentally adjust their scores downward in accordance with how much you think being highly educated and relatively wealthy should overstate their scores relative to the general population. So, what were their scores?

The correlation matrices were provided in the paper's figures 1 through 3. If we assume that the scale we want is based on a mean of 100 and an SD of 15 (\"the IQ metric\"), we just place the gaps on that scale (i.e., *15 + 100), subtract the number of factors times 100, divide that by the square root of the sum of the elements in the correlation matrix (we'll use the American values, since their sample was larger), and add back 100. </p><p>The Kenyan sample, which was 1-2 SDs above the Kenyan average in terms of education, had a mean IQ score of 79.08 versus the American average of 100. The Ghanaian sample, which was 3-4 SDs above the Ghanaian average in terms of education, had a mean IQ of 92.32 versus the American average of 100. And do note, the American average the Ghanaian sample would be compared to would be lower than the average the Kenyan sample was compared to due to demographic change over time.</p><p>These estimates are much higher than Lynn&#8217;s, and that makes sense, because these are clearly socioeconomically extremely well-off samples, perhaps not by Western standards, but certainly by their own national standards. But some people think these <em>are </em>the sorts of samples that should be used to represent poor countries. That&#8217;s wrong, but the view has its supporters, like <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608010000348\">Wicherts, Dolan, Carlson and van der Maas, who claimed as much in 2010</a>. But Lynn called this out at the time too:</p><blockquote><p>Wicherts, Dolan, Carlson &amp; van der Maas (WDCM) (2010) contend that the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa assessed by the Progressive Matrices is 78 in relation to a British mean of 100, Flynn effect corrected to 77, and reduced further to 76 to adjust for around 20% of Africans who do not attend school and are credited with an IQ of 71. This estimate is higher than the average of 67 proposed by Lynn and Vanhanen (2002, 2006) and Lynn (2006).</p><p>The crucial issues in estimating the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa concern the selection of studies of acceptable representative samples, and the adjustment of IQs obtained from unrepresentative samples to make them approximately representative. Many samples have been drawn from schools but these are a problem because significant numbers of children in sub-Saharan Africa have not attended schools during the last sixty years or so, and those who attend schools have higher average IQs than those who do not.</p></blockquote><p>Lynn then reviewed general population studies and those returned a Sub-Saharan African mean IQ in the 60s. He subsequently reviewed primary school studies and the data yielded a median of 71, which he adjusted to 69 to account for the fact that only about 80% of the population gets a primary school education in Sub-Saharan Africa. After that, he reviewed studies of secondary school students, and those returned a mean IQ in the 70s, but that is not an acceptable estimate for a few simple reasons.</p><blockquote><p>(1) many adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa have not attended secondary school and tertiary institutes. For instance, Notcutt estimated that in South Africa in 1950 only about 25% of children aged 7-17 were in schools and &#8220;we cannot assume that those who are in school are a representative sample of the population&#8221;. (2) Entry to secondary school has generally been by competitive examination, resulting in those with higher IQs being selected for admission. Thus, &#8220;entry to secondary schools in the East African countries of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania is competitive&#8230; approximately 25 percent of the population complete the seven standards of primary school and there are secondary places for 10-12 percent of these&#8221;. Similarly, Silvey writing of Uganda around 1970 stated that at this time only 2% of children were admitted to secondary schools and entry is determined partly by a primary school leaving examination, and Heynman and Jamison writing of Uganda in 1972, note that admission to secondary school is based on &#8220;achievement performance on the academic selection examination&#8230; and there are secondary school places for only one child in 10&#8221;.</p></blockquote><p>This is egregious, but this is typical for higher estimates for poor places. They tend to be based on samples that are, as in these cases, <em>relatively </em>privileged, pre-screened for IQ, etc., and despite that, <em>still generally not that impressive </em>in socioeconomic or IQ terms. These also aren&#8217;t the worst estimates like this that Lynn has noted. My favorite was this:</p><blockquote><p>WDCM include a number of studies that cannot be accepted for a variety of reasons. Their samples of university students are clearly unrepresentative. The Crawford-Nutt sample consisted of high school students (IQ 84) in math classes admission to which &#8220;is dependent on the degree of excellence of the pupil&#8217;s performance in the lower classes&#8221; and described as &#8220;a select segment of the population&#8221;. The students were also coached on how to do the test and &#8220;Teaching the strategies required to solve Matrix problems yields dramatic short-term gains in score&#8221;. This is clearly an unrepresentative sample.</p></blockquote><p>Curiously, people usually &#8216;get this&#8217; sort of representativeness issue when it comes to things like China only sampling from rich, well-off areas to look good in international assessments like PISA and TIMSS, but they don&#8217;t get this when it applies to samples that look rich by one country&#8217;s standards and poor by the standards of the developed world. It&#8217;s precisely those sorts of large-scale examinations which bring me to the easiest way to vindicate Lynn&#8217;s sampling in a very general sense.</p><p>Large-scale international examinations like PISA have sampling frames, requirements to be met for a sample&#8217;s scores to be considered valid and comparable to those of other countries, and if countries meet them, then it&#8217;s likely their samples were sufficiently representative to make a statement about a country&#8217;s youth or, in the case of assessments like PIAAC, its adults. These large-scale assessments have standards for sampling, and <a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/bias-is-often-unpredictable\">they also have psychometric standards</a>. Their samples end up representative&#8212;at least of developed countries (see above in this section)&#8212;and their test scores aren&#8217;t biased, and these still correlate highly with the results produced by Lynn and his colleagues. This is the basis for the World Bank&#8217;s HLOs, so by this point in this article, you&#8217;ve already seen this point made multiple times! And to be completely fair to Lynn, he made this point too, people just neglect that he did. It&#8217;s no doubt part of why he computed his own academic achievement test-based national IQs (see Footnote 3).</p><h4>&#8220;But IQs Below 60 Are Unrealistic!&#8221;</h4><p>Some people probably still think that some of Lynn&#8217;s estimates are too low. Lynn believed the same thing in cases where there just wasn&#8217;t enough data, which is why he Winsorized national IQ estimates and expressed his doubts about <em>extremely </em>low estimates. <span class=\"mention-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Sebastian Jensen&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:79958228,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;user&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:null,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facb363c6-6a5b-4b87-a4b4-12e25fd98679_600x600.jpeg&quot;,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;b68653ba-6c04-4574-95b7-1f085dc95641&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"MentionToDOM\"></span> recently noted that sub-60 IQs also aren&#8217;t empirically supported. <a href=\"https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/no-country-has-an-iq-below-60\">Through reviewing additional evidence on countries listed as having sub-60 IQs</a>, he found that each one ended up with either no estimate (due to missingness) or an IQ above 60.</p><p>The unstated part of the argument that some national IQ estimates are unrealistically low is that somehow this disqualifies larger portions of the dataset, but that&#8217;s a <em>non sequitur</em>.</p><h4>&#8220;But Lynn Disadvantaged Poor Countries By Using Child Samples!&#8221;</h4><p>Some people have claimed that Lynn made poor countries appear to perform worse than they actually do by using samples of children instead of adults. This criticism <a href=\"https://menghu.substack.com/p/national-iq-papers-must-be-retracted\">reveals a lack of awareness that test scores have age-specific norms</a>. But if we assume it&#8217;s a legitimate criticism, then it suggests Lynn unfairly <em>advantaged </em>poor countries since the existing not-so-strong evidence shows that those countries are more likely <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691823001919\">to have scores that </a><em><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691823001919\">decline relatively with age</a></em>.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;National IQs Suffer From Psychometric Bias!&#8221;</h3><p>During Lynn&#8217;s life, he didn&#8217;t focus much on psychometric bias. This is fair, because by the time it became a big focus for the field, he was already old. But in any case, as I&#8217;ve noted above, we have little reason to think it&#8217;s a big concern for most estimates. Furthermore, it&#8217;s not even clear that bias is systematic in general. Consider, for example, the comparison of Britons and South Africans I discussed <a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/bias-is-often-unpredictable\">here</a>. In that comparison, there was bias, but it favored the lower-scoring South African group!</p><p>In general, when people find representative samples and no psychometric bias, the results aren&#8217;t different from what Lynn found, so unless someone wants to substantiate this concern, it&#8217;s little more than a waste of ink.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;The Flynn Effect Means National IQs Are Liable to Change!&#8221;</h3><p>The Flynn effect is widely misunderstood. <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/subscriber-preview-taking-the-flynn\">I've written an article on this that goes into much greater depth about what I mean</a>. But the important point when it comes to national IQs is that the Flynn effect is not about differences in intelligence, instead, it primarily concerns test bias. The existence of the Flynn effect also doesn&#8217;t imply there will be convergence between countries, it cannot be said to be the source of any convergence across countries without evidence that doesn&#8217;t currently exist, and the Flynn effect is explicitly adjusted for in national IQ computation. It just doesn&#8217;t have any relevance to the discussion because the evidence for larger Flynn effects during catch-up economic growth is extraordinarily poor.</p><p>But furthermore, increases in scores for cohorts over time <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/a-requiem-for-nutrition\">will sometimes reflect bias rather than ability gains</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/changes-in-relative-cognitive-performance\">relative cognitive performance across countries is generally very stable</a>.

Because <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/118965416/national-head-sizes-are-consistent-over-time\">development seemingly minimally impacts brain sizes</a>&#8212;and <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/i/146562912/allah-reveals-the-power-of-nutrition\">it theoretically should not anyway</a>&#8212;, brain sizes can be used successfully to instrument for national IQs, allowing us to estimate the causal impact of national IQs on outcomes like growth, crime rates, and so on. This has been done and <a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1660778494966607874\">it works well</a>. The same result also turns up using ancestry-adjusted UVR and numeracy measured in the 19th century, both of which also can&#8217;t be caused by modern development.</p><p>These results suggest that if Lynn is getting the causality backwards from IQ to measures of national economic success, he&#8217;s still dominantly correct that national IQs precede development. Not only that, but national IQs are, as mentioned, largely stable over time, despite the world experiencing a lot of development. We can see this very directly using the World Bank&#8217;s HLOs again. The paper introducing them includes this diagram, showing (a) percentages enrolled in primary education over time, and (b) HLOs over the same period. Notice the dramatic increase in the former and relative stability of the latter.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\"

themselves, they&#8217;re just specifying an alternative claim that they hope sounds like it can invalidate Lynn&#8217;s estimates. But&#8212;and here&#8217;s the kicker&#8212;Lynn firmly believed that national IQs would increase with development; his estimates were point-in-time estimates, not the final letter forever and ever, and he fully expected them to change because he thought very poor places were environmentally disadvantaged. So this isn&#8217;t even really an argument against Lynn&#8217;s general views <em>per se</em>.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;What About [Fake Data]?&#8221;</h3><p>People often reply to national IQ estimates with news articles, misinterpreted scientific articles, or nonsense sources that they allege show low-scoring countries actually do very well. Three examples that were brought up to me recently were Iran, India, and online IQ tests.</p><p>The example of Iran was <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/ijom/fulltext/2019/10000/estimation_of_mean_intelligence_quotient_with.34.aspx\">a meta-analysis of different studies of Iranians</a>. Someone brought this up to me to claim that Iran actually had a national IQ like America&#8217;s, at 97.12. Perplexed, I asked the simple question: Did they use American or British norms? And the answer is &#8216;no&#8217;, the test norms were Iranian, so if anything, these samples had an IQ below what&#8217;s expected&#8212;that is, <em>a mean of 100.</em> There&#8217;s really no need to ask further questions about these results, because being on different norms and not having the handbook handy to make the scores comparable means that they do not permit international comparisons. But this is a pretty standard sort of argument for people to make to contradict Lynn&#8217;s estimates.</p><p>The example of India was <a href=\"https://archive.md/s7h5O\">a news report</a> about alleged testing of Indian students by Mensa&#8217;s India chapter. The report reads:</p><blockquote><p>In the past couple of months, Mensa India, Delhi, administered its internationally recognized IQ test to over 4,000 underprivileged children in Delhi and NCR as part of a unique project aimed at identifying and mentoring poor children with high IQ. Of the 102 extremely bright children it selected, over a dozen, including Amisha, achieved an IQ score of 145-plus, which puts her in the genius category.</p><p>The others achieved IQ scores of 130-145, which puts them in the category of &#8216;very gifted&#8217; children. The average score in Mensa India&#8217;s IQ test is between 85 and 115. Interestingly, all of these children are sons and daughters of labourers, rickshaw pullers, security guards, street vendors, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Now, does this say anything in defiance of Lynn&#8217;s numbers? No, because we don&#8217;t know the norms. We don&#8217;t even know much about these statistics at all, we just have hearsay without accompanying statistics. This barely rises above an anecdote, but it is the sort of thing that people will misinterpret to mean Lynn was wrong, somehow.</p><p>The online IQ test argument is one of the silliest, but it gives people a lot of hope. They argue that test results such as <a href=\"https://international-iq-test.com/en/test/IQ_by_country\">these</a>, produced by people self-selecting into taking tests of unknown and&#8212;<a href=\"https://x.com/cremieuxrecueil/status/1875304427462258871\">when vetted</a>&#8212;dubious validity suggest that national IQ estimates are way off the mark. But they don&#8217;t do that, because they&#8217;re based on selective rather than representative samples. Relatedly, people sometimes argue that national IQ estimates are wrong because international students taking American tests like the GRE perform better than, say, Americans, when the national IQ of their country of origin is lower than America&#8217;s. But once again, this test-taking is selective, making it less relevant than proponents of using that data to reject national IQs might hope.</p><p>Another less common strategy to reject national IQs is to just unreasonably ignore data. For example, today I encountered someone who plotted Haiti&#8217;s national IQ over time with two datapoints, one from the late-1940s and the other from the late-1970s. They alleged that Haiti had gotten much smarter over time, with their national IQ rising from around 60 to almost 100. But looking at all available data, <a href=\"https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/average-iq-of-haiti\">this view cannot be supported</a>. What they did to make their claim isn&#8217;t even a reasonable way to compute a national IQ. Getting a national IQ estimate requires looking at multiple lines of evidence and qualifying the inclusion of samples and whatnot, whereas their strategy was to act like there were just two studies to discuss and to conclude that the later one was the ground-truth regardless of its reliability or any other of its qualities.</p><div><hr></div><h3>&#8220;National IQs Don&#8217;t Measure Differences in Intelligence!&#8221;</h3><p>This complaint takes two forms. The first is the more general rejection of intelligence tests measuring intelligence. That&#8217;s not relevant to national IQs and it&#8217;s poorly supported, but the arguments on that topic are familiar, so I&#8217;ll skip to the relevant argument.</p><p>The second form is that, for some reason, differences in national IQs are due to different factors than those that explain test performance within populations. This perspective is incompatible with measurement invariance, so it is necessarily wrong for any psychometrically unbiased comparisons. A sense in which the claim can be recovered is that for a given unbiased comparison, there might be mean differences in specific factors rather than in <em>g</em>&#8212;a sort of international versions of the <em>contra hypothesis </em>for <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289615000549\">Spearman&#8217;s hypothesis</a>. This is not the case for the PISA tests or any other unbiased national IQ comparison of which I&#8217;m aware, so while it&#8217;s a possible perspective, it&#8217;s empirically contradicted at the moment.</p><p>Some people prefer achievement tests to national IQs, despite the positive manifold strongly suggesting that achievement tests and IQ tests both measure <em>g</em><a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-8\" href=\"#footnote-8\" target=\"_self\">8</a>, and confirmatory factor modeling confirming that. The people with that preference also tend to make another, related argument: that achievement tests are not measures of <em>g</em> and cannot be treated as such. But like the above arguments, there are only negative reasons to think this is true for international examinations like the <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-90838-001\">PISA</a> tests, which <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289622000344\">have a strong general dimension</a>, much like standard IQ tests.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Criticisms of National IQs Are Intellectually Lazy</h3><p>People <em>really want </em>national IQ estimates to be debunked or, worse, to feel personally favorable. So they concoct a lot of bad arguments to make it sound like national IQs are off. To recap, here are some of the ways:</p><ul><li><p>They confuse themselves and others about how mental retardation is defined and act as though it&#8217;s defined by IQ alone, so certain national IQs must be implausible. In doing so, they ignore the importance and existence of norms, as well as the modern definition of mental retardation itself.</p></li><li><p>They claim methodological choices like imputation are extraordinarily biasing when that is not the case and checking shows that the choice is actually not even biasing in the direction of national IQs being unfair to the groups national IQs have been proposed to illustrate bias against.</p></li><li><p>They claim that sampling is directionally biased in a certain way, when inspection of the data generally shows that, if anything, it&#8217;s biased in a way that leads to understated lower-tail cognitive differentiation.</p></li><li><p>They make claims that &#8216;sound right&#8217; like that comparing children and adults is bad, even when we have age-based norms, so this cannot be a genuine criticism unless it is theoretically qualified that somehow children in certain countries are more disadvantaged than their adults and that this disadvantage translates to lower cognitive performance. I&#8217;m not aware of anyone who believes this theoretical qualifier and existing evidence speaks against it.</p></li><li><p>They make groundless extrapolations like &#8216;The Flynn effect means national IQs are worthless&#8217; or &#8216;national IQs have changed a lot&#8217; and they refuse to justify these inferences.</p></li><li><p>They look for odd references and outlier studies to justify throwing out a whole corpus of material.</p></li><li><p>Etc.</p></li></ul><p>The common thread between different national IQ criticisms is the weaponization of ignorance. Critics toss out claims they think are right or which sound right, and they don&#8217;t check their work. A stand-out example is that people regularly say that Lynn was biased against Sub-Saharan Africans on the basis of his use of samples that are well-off by the standards of their countries purely because they are poor by the standards of the developed world. But this argument cannot stand. It has no merit, and it only serves to insult the reader and to convince them that the person making the argument has done some of the required work to dismiss Lynn&#8217;s estimates, when they&#8217;ve really only done the required work to say they&#8217;ve just barely cracked open the book!</p><p>After throwing out enough criticisms, people feel that national IQ estimates simply cannot stand, that they must be wrong, or so many criticisms wouldn&#8217;t be possible in the first place. But on this they&#8217;re wrong, and the very fact that they have so many criticisms is a strike against them, because the criticisms are so uniformly bad that they <em>should </em>embarrass the person making them. Making matters worse, critics seem to never go back when they&#8217;re shown to be wrong. Their attempted debunkings get roundly debunked and national IQ estimates remain reliable as ever, and they just keep making the same tired arguments that no right-minded person could still believe.</p><p>The defining feature of criticisms of national IQs is not all of this lazy argument though, it&#8217;s what comes next: <em>insults</em>. People like Lynn are taken to be &#8216;stupid&#8217;, people who believe in a given estimate that upsets people regardless of how well-supported it is are taken to be &#8216;morons&#8217;, and looking into and understanding national IQ estimates becomes less common because, after all, the only people who would look into them are the sorts of &#8216;stupid moron racists&#8217; who actually bother to check their work.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Questions?

      "script_text": "If you follow me here or on Twitter/X, I’m sure you’ve seen a map like this, showing country-level differences in average IQs:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nMap derived from Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen’s IQ and the Wealth of Nations\nThe figures in this map are derived from a raft of studies compiled by Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen in their 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations. The book itself is little more than a compilation and discussion of these studies, all of which are IQ estimates from samples located in different countries or based on diasporas (e.g., refugees) from those countries.\nTo get this out of the way, the estimates from IQ and the Wealth of Nations hold up. They are replicable and they are meaningful. At the same time, they are contentious. Lynn and Vanhanen’s estimates have many detractors, but virtually all of the negative arguments have one thing in common: they’re based on the idea that the estimates feel wrong, rather than with any actual inaccuracies with them.\nLet’s review.\n\n“Countries Can’t Have Mean IQs in the 70s!”\nOne of the most common arguments against Lynn and Vanhanen’s national IQ estimates is that it is simply impossible for whole countries’ mean IQs to be what people often consider to be so low that they’re considered prima facie evidence of mental retardation. This feeling is based on misconceptions about how mental retardation is diagnosed and defined, and misunderstandings about the meanings of very low IQs across populations. Let’s tackle definition first.\nThe belief that mental retardation is defined by an IQ threshold is similar to many of the arguments against the validity of national IQs in that it is based on a failure to give even a cursory thought to one’s own arguments. It’s a belief that cannot survive reading the latest version of the DSM, or for that matter, thinking of psychologists as competent people. If you open up the DSM-5 and turn to the section entitled Intellectual Disabilities, the first thing you see is the diagnostic criteria, which read as follows:\n\nThe following three criteria must be met:\n\nDeficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem solving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, and learning from experience, confirmed by both clinical assessment and individualized, standardized intelligence testing.\n\nDeficits in adaptive functioning that result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life, such as communication, social participation, and independent living, across multiple environments, such as home, school, work, and community.\n\nOnset of intellectual and adaptive deficits during the developmental period.\nThere are four listed severity levels for mental retardation, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Profound, and they are “defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not IQ scores, because it is adaptive functioning that determines the level of supports required. Moreover, IQ measures are less valid in the lower end of the IQ range.” It’s true that most mentally retarded people have IQs in the range of 55 to 70, so it’s easy to get misled into thinking that IQ is the defining factor for mental retardation. But an IQ of about 70 and below only indicates (but doesn’t diagnose) mental retardation because of what it tends to be caused by in certain populations. This is a roundabout way of saying that a low IQ indicates mental retardation because of what it means for a person's behavior, which, I'll explain, covaries with its causes.\nIQs are mostly normally distributed, and IQs represent the influences of multiple different constructs and causes, but they primarily reflect differences in general intelligence. At the same time, there’s a major deviation from normality at the lower end of the scale. If you sample well enough, the picture you’d get would look like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nJensen, 1969\nThe reason is that there are the normal-range causes that produce the traditional bell curve, and then there are extreme circumstances that produce extraordinarily low IQs. Contrarily, we don't know of anything that produces abnormally high IQs. There's no known one-off mutation that makes someone a genius, but there are several mutations that we now know can make a person extremely unintelligent. Consider these:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nYoung and Martin 2023, Figure 1\nIt's much easier to break a machine than to throw a wrench in it and make it work better. And that makes sense! Your wrench in the gears is likely to break something, not to increase efficiency. If you hit someone in the head hard enough, you can reduce their IQ score, but not in a million years will you turn them into von Neumann.\nThe reason someone's IQ drops after you bludgeon them is more singular and specific than the reasons IQ varies in the general population. A hit to the noggin may leave someone unable to flex their short-term memory, even if their visuospatial rotation capabilities are unaffected. There's some degree of isolation of function and compensation for deficits in the brain. We know this thanks to many observations, like on the effects of neural lesions.\nWhen we say that someone with an IQ of ≤70 is mentally retarded, we're saying that they lack adaptive behavior—that they're not very bright, and so it makes living life hard. When someone with an IQ >70 is mentally retarded—which happens!—we’re saying the same thing. But if a population legitimately has a mean IQ of 70 (and some do), we'll notice that they're not drooling troglodytes who can't put on their shoes. This is because the reasons for their low IQ are not things that cause specific and extreme deficits, but instead, things that cause normal-range variation, which is far less severe in nature than something that causes massive, specific, discontinuously-caused deficits.\nSupposing discontinuous causes that create major, specific deficits yields testable consequences. We can see them play out clearly by leveraging different countries’ population registers.\nIn large Israeli (B) and Swedish (A) datasets, we can see that when a person has a mild intellectual disability, their sibling tends to be less intelligent too. You also see this for heights, autism, or any other highly polygenic trait. This is expected with continuously distributed causes because siblings share portions of their genetic endowments.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nReichenberg et al. 2015, Fig. 1\nBut when a sibling has a severe—otherwise known as, \"idiopathic\" 1 —intellectual disability that's likely to have a discontinuous cause, the distribution of their siblings’ IQs is the same as the distribution for the general population. And of course they would, because the reason for the difference isn’t something that siblings should be expected to partially share.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\nReichenberg et al. 2015, Fig. 3\nThe deficits in adaptive behavior that result from idiopathic intellectual disability are ones that make life hard to live in discrete and extreme ways. In some cases, you wouldn't even recognize them as being \"retarded\" because they have conditions like amnesia, where the person is clearly odd and unfortunate, and they score poorly on an IQ test, but they might sound totally coherent otherwise.\nNormal-range causes lead to linear changes in adaptive behavior; idiopathic mental retardation, leads to a discontinuous decrease in adaptive behavior.\nAccordingly, an IQ of 70 does not have the same meaning for members of different groups, since if a group with a mean IQ of 70 randomly pulls a person with an IQ of 70, they aren't likely to score like someone who's mentally retarded for idiopathic reasons. Arthur Jensen, incidentally, predicted this sort of result in his 1972 Genetics and Education based on some observations he made as an educator.\n\nMy student said he was looking for a good culture-free or culture-fair test of intelligence and had not been able to find one. All the tests he used, whether they were claimed to be culture-fair or not, were in considerable agreement with respect to children diagnosed as educationally mentally retarded (EMR), by which they were assigned to special small classes offering a different instructional program from that in the regular classes. To qualify for this special treatment, children had to have IQs below 75 as well as lagging far behind their age-mates in scholastic performance. My student, who had examined many of these backward pupils himself, had gained the impression that the tests were quite valid in their assessments of white middle-class children but not of minority lower-class children.\nMany of the latter, despite IQs below 75 and markedly poor scholastic performance, did not seem nearly as retarded as the white middle-class children with comparable IQs and scholastic records. Middle-class white children with IQs in the EMR range generally appeared more retarded than the minority children who were in special classes. Using nonverbal rather than verbal tests did not appreciably alter the problem. I confirmed my students observations for myself by observing EMR children in their classes and on the playground and by discussing their characteristics with a number of teachers and school psychologists. My student’s observations proved reliable.\nEMR children who were called ‘culturally disadvantaged’, as contrasted with middle-class EMR children, appeared much brighter socially and on the playground, often being quite indistinguishable in every way from children of normal IQ except in their scholastic performance and in their scores on a variety of standard IQ tests. Middle-class white children diagnosed as EMR, on the other hand, though they constituted a much smaller percentage of the EMR classes, usually appeared to be more mentally retarded all round and not just in their performance in scholastic subjects and IQ tests. I asked myself, how could one devise a testing procedure that would reveal this distinction so that it could be brought under closer study and not depend upon casual observations and impressions.\nThe distinction between types of mental retardation that are demarcated by their symptoms and, thus, by their causes, is important to understand. It's why an IQ of 70 for a Japanese person is likely to indicate an extraordinarily severe issue in need of attention, while for a Bushman, they won't have any trouble surviving. This is why the DSM-V notes in the Diagnostic Features section and bolded here: “The essential features of intellectual disability are deficits in general mental abilities (Criterion 1) and impairment in everyday adaptive functioning, in comparison to an individual’s age-, gender-, and socioculturally matched peers(Criterion 2).”\nKeep that bolded part in mind and you’ll understand the importance of test norming and, knowing about discontinuous causes and the adaptive functioning deficit requirement for retardation diagnosis, you’ll never again be able to think that a mean IQ around 70 invalidates national IQs. But there’s another reason you shouldn’t, and it’s that you’re probably not an ultra-hereditarian.\nIn 2010, Richard Lynn pointed out that high IQs in Sub-Saharan Africa were incompatible with anything but the judgment that the group differences in the U.S. were entirely genetic in origin and even extremely poor environments have no effects on cognitive development. In response to an attempt to say that Sub-Saharan Africans had a mean IQ closer to 80 than 70, he wrote:\n\n[The] assumption that [some of these samples of] children had IQs of 85 and 88 seems improbable. These are the IQs of blacks in the United States. It can hardly be possible that blacks in the United States who have all the advantages of living in an economically developed country, with high income, good health care, good nutrition and education, would have the same IQ as blacks in impoverished Nigeria. If this were so, we would have to infer that these environmental disadvantages have no effect whatever on IQs and even the most hard line hereditarians would not go that far.\nOr, if you want to see this point made diagrammatically (courtesy of X user AnechoicMedia), here you are:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nLow IQs are also predictable from national development, making them that much more realistic. Using the latest national IQ dataset, I’ll show this for Sub-Saharan Africa—a region often claimed to have invalid IQs precisely because they’re ‘too low’.\nFirst, we’ll predict Sub-Saharan African national IQ from a regression of log(GDP PPP Per Capita) on national IQ estimates. Whether the regression is performed with or without Sub-Saharan Africa, the results are similar. The measured mean IQ of Sub-Saharan Africa is 71.96, the predicted IQ in the regression with Sub-Saharan Africa included is 74.86, and without them, it’s 76.78. Or in other words, it’s not very different.\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nWithout the logs, the predicted IQs are 78.29 and 82.47, but that’s not an appropriate model, as you’ll see in a moment. But first, you might contest the latest national IQ dataset. The studies underlying its estimates and the methodology to assemble them are well-documented, so if you really want to contest them, you should start there. But if you dismiss them out of hand, you still can’t escape prediction by development, because we can just use the World Bank’s Harmonized Learning Outcomes(HLOs), an alternative national IQ dataset created by qualified researchers (including Noam Angrist), with good methods (test-score-linking), recently published (2021) in a respectable journal ( Nature). 2\nUsing HLOs, the observed mean IQ of Sub-Saharan Africa turns out to be 71.05. The predicted mean IQ with Sub-Saharan Africa in the regression is 72.25, and without it, 72.55. Without logs, those predictions become 77.35 and 81.85. But again, that model isn’t appropriate. The reason it’s not appropriate is due to nonlinearities that logging helps to handle. Take a look:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nYou can see this same nonlinearity elsewhere, such as in PISA scores:\n\nImage: Source within: https://ourworldindata.org/financing-education\n\n\n\nSource\nSo to overcome this issue, we can do a simple piecewise regression. Using a GDP PPP Per Capita of $50,000 as the cut-point—and feel free to go use whatever you want, it doesn’t really change the result so long as it’s reasonable—we get these regressions:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nWith this method, the predicted mean IQ of Sub-Saharan Africa is 76.12 with it included and 79.77 without. Using the World Bank’s HLOs instead, the results are 73.75 with Sub-Saharan Africa and 76.6 without it.\nAll of these estimates are pretty close to the ground-truth, and I suspect they would be even closer if all the data came from the same years instead of near years, and I know it’s closer if Actual Individual Consumption is used instead of GDP Per Capita, since that tends to iron out some of the issues with tax havens and oil barons. But regardless, it should now be apparent that low national IQs are\n\nNot indications of widespread, debilitating mental retardation\n\nWhere they’re predicted to be given levels of national development\n\nThus not a reason to cast aside national IQ estimates\n\n“Lynn Imputed Estimates, So The National IQs Are Fake!”\nIn his earlier national IQ datasets, Lynn ran into a lot of missing data. To get around this issue, he exploited the fact that there’s spatial autocorrelation in order to provide imputed national IQs. Some people think, however, that these imputed IQs are bad and make his data fake, failing to realize that imputation is normal and it doesn’t have meaningful effects on Lynn’s national IQ estimates.\nIn the most recent dataset Lynn created before he died, his imputation procedure was like so:\n\nTo calculate these imputations, Lynn and Becker (2019a, b) took advantage of the spatial autocorrelation that often exists in international data and identified the three countries with the longest land borders that had IQ means. A mean IQ, weighted by the length of the land border, was calculated and used as an estimate for the country’s missing estimated mean IQ. For island nations, the three closest countries with IQ data were identified, and an unweighted mean was calculated and imputed as an estimated mean IQ value for the missing country’s data.\nGeographic imputation of this sort is the responsible thing to do when data is not missing at random and it can be predicted from other values in the dataset, because more data means more power and, given the nature of the missingness, less bias. So whether Lynn was being responsible or irresponsible is a matter of how well the imputations hold up. Thankfully, they do hold up.\nThe simplest way to check the robustness of Lynn’s national IQs is to compare his imputed national IQs to subsequently sampled national IQs. I’ll do this with his much maligned 2002 and 2012 national IQs. To assess the validity of the imputed IQs I’ll correlate them with our current best national IQs and the World Bank HLOs.\nLynn’s 2002 imputed national IQs correlate at r= 0.90 with our current best national IQs and 0.72 with HLOs. 102 countries were imputed which we now have estimates for. Compared to our current best national IQs, 72 were overestimates and the average estimation error was 1.47 points upwards. The average overestimation on Lynn’s part was 3.71 points, and the average underestimation was 3.75 points. Since these were imputed countries, they don’t really reveal anything about Lynn’s estimation biases in general, as they’re a select subset of generally poor or small countries. Lynn’s 2012 imputed national IQs correlate at r= 0.92 with our current best national IQs and 0.76 with HLOs. 66 countries were imputed which we now have estimates for. Compared to our current best national IQs, 37 were overestimates and the average estimation error was 0.72 points upwards. The average overestimation on Lynn’s part was 3.48 points, and the average underestimation was 2.61 points. 3\nI want to mention again that it should not be surprising that this procedure doesn’t really do much. It’s simple, straightforward, and scientifically uncontroversial, plus it’s theoretically sound, so it’s not shocking that it works. In a related domain, I found that this worked out just fine in the U.S.\nI took the NAEP Black-White score gaps from the lower-48 and predicted them for each state from the observed gap for their immediate neighbors. The Michigan-Minnesota and New York-Rhode Island water borders were counted as neighboring state borders, and the result of imputing across state borders was a correlation of about 0.60 with the real gaps:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nWith a larger sample size and even more so with imputation just of observations that are missing for theoretically important reasons, this would almost certainly work better, but regardless, it’s fine: Imputation just works.\n\n“Lynn Was Systematically Biased Against Non-Whites!”\nThis is easy to check, so you have to wonder why people believe it. If it were true, it would be easy to show rather than to merely assert. 4 To check this, just compare Lynn’s estimated national IQs to independent collections of national IQ estimates and see if they vary systematically and meaningfully. I’ve done this, with both our current best national IQs as the reference and using World Bank HLOs as reference. The results are practically the same, but this should be unsurprising, since Lynn computed sets of national IQs based on IQ tests and based on achievement tests, and they were highly aligned. But I digress. Here’s what I found using the current best national IQs:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nCompared to our current best estimates, Lynn’s original estimates were pretty close to the line, with a mix of under- and over-estimation. The degree of under- and over-estimation is minor, ranging between underestimating Sub-Saharan Africa by 1.89 points and overestimating Latin America by 4.21 points. Europe was overestimated by just 1.01 points, indicating no real evidence for the theory that Lynn favored Whites. If we drop imputed numbers, then we can see this even more clearly, because Sub-Saharan Africa without imputation was actually underestimated by an even larger margin of 2.40 points, but Europe without imputation was only overestimated by 0.18 points.\nFast forward to Lynn’s 2012 dataset and the results are even tighter, and the underestimation of Sub-Saharan Africa drops to 0.49 points, while the overestimation of Europe follows in lock-step, falling to 0.04 points. Without imputation, these numbers become 0.97 points of underestimation and, curiously, Europe is actually underestimated by 0.15 points.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to producing replicable estimates, the estimates Lynn produced also weren’t off by much in general. I don’t think this should be surprising, but some people have responded to this with the argument that…\n“Lynn’s Estimates Were Never Validated By Independent Data!”\nThis is a response to the above that is, simply put, a complete lie. The idea here is that the above validation of Lynn’s national IQ estimates is based on looking only at permutations of Lynn’s national IQ estimates, derived largely from the same sets of studies. But there is only one way to arrive at that view, and it’s to simply assume it’s true without looking at the data to see that it’s clearly not.\nThe wonderful thing about Lynn’s data is that he documents all of his decisions and you can peruse his national IQ database, cutting out studies you don’t like and adjusting all the estimates accordingly. Reasonable changes to Lynn’s adjustments and inclusions don’t make a difference. The data is publicly available, so you can go and confirm that yourself. But an even simpler way to show that Lynn’s estimates hold up is to just see if they hold up in data that’s entirely non-overlapping with Lynn’s data. So for that, I’ll use the World Bank’s HLOs:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThe World Bank HLOs correlate at 0.83 with Lynn’s estimates with imputation and 0.89 without imputation. Compared to HLOs, Lynn underestimated Sub-Saharan Africa by a piddling 5.03 points, but he also underestimated Europeans by 0.61 points, and overestimated Oceania, Latin America, and South Asia by 5.71, 2.74, and 5.89 points, respectively.\nThis is just not consistent with a pattern of strong, European-favoring misestimation, and if we drop Lynn’s imputations that becomes even clearer because the underestimation of Sub-Saharan Africa increases to 5.44 points, while the overestimation of Oceania, Latin America, and South Asia shift to 2.68, 1.97, and 1.92 points. And if we look at Lynn’s later 2012 national IQ estimates, the patterns just aren’t that different, a fact that’s true whether we subset HLOs to be derived completely beyond the dates of Lynn’s data or not.\nSo to summarize, unless everyone shares Lynn’s biases, then his national IQ estimates do not suggest he was biased in favor of Europeans. The impacts of his imputation methods also suggest that he wasn’t biased in that direction either.\n\n“The Samples Lynn Used Were Often Very Poor!”\nA major argument that Lynn was in the wrong is that some of his samples were disadvantaged, underprivileged, or whatever other euphemisms you might wish to use for being poor, and that perhaps his samples from poor countries were worse in this respect, because he wanted them to look worse. This doesn’t stand up to scrutiny.\nLynn always caveated national IQs based on limited samples. Though you won’t see that if you just look at the resulting national IQ maps, you definitely see that if you look in his books describing what data was used, how it was gathered, and so on. It is true that some of Lynn’s referenced samples were very poor, but this always has to be considered in the light of representativeness. If poverty is the norm for a region, then samples should be poor to be representative. Similarly, if a health condition like anemia is the norm for a region—and in many places, it actually is!—then the best sample will have high rates of anemia, regardless of whether that’s ‘acceptable’ for a sample from a developed Western country. 5\nWe can think about this in the context of a few sample means from poor places which we know to be psychometrically unbiased when compared with U.S. samples. In this case, I’ll reference samples Russell Warne provided data on from Kenya and Ghana.\nThe samples were from 1997 and 2015 and they used the WISC-III in Kenya and WAIS-IV in Ghana. The Kenyan test-takers came from grade 8 schools and the Ghanaian ones were public and private high schoolers from Accra, alongside a sample of university students.\nThe problem with this sampling is that education in Kenya in 1997 and Ghana in 2015 is nowhere near this level. In Kenya, most people didn't even reach grade 8 at the time, and in Ghana, most people don't reach university but university students were 57% of the sample! Furthermore, the Kenyan sample was from Nairobi, so it was at least sampled in what was, as of 2018, Kenya's 2nd-richest county and home to <9% of the population. The situation was even less representative in Ghana, where the sample was from Accra and thus also <9% of the population and a third of Ghana's GDP.\nThese samples were highly unrepresentative of their respective populations because they were relatively elite. The bias was not as bad in the Kenyan sample: they were one to two SDs above the country as a whole in socioeconomic status. But in Ghana, they were three to four SDs above the average. That's like comparing high school dropouts to college graduates.\nWarne knew of this problem and wrote:\n\nAs eighth-graders, the members of this sample were more educated than the average Kenyan. In 1997, the average Kenyan adult had 4.7 years of formal schooling; by 2019, this average had increased to 6.6 years.\nAnd:\n\nLike the [Kenyan] sample, this [Ghanaian] sample is much more educated than the average person in the country. In 2015, the average Ghanaian adult had 7.8 years of schooling (which increased to 8.3 years by 2019), whereas 61% of [this sample] had 16 years of education or more.\nKnowing this, mentally adjust their scores downward in accordance with how much you think being highly educated and relatively wealthy should overstate their scores relative to the general population. So, what were their scores? Here:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nTo put these scores into intuitive terms, we need to do two things: the factor correlation matrix and an assumption of equal latent variances. The correlation matrices were provided in the paper's figures 1 through 3. If we assume that the scale we want is based on a mean of 100 and an SD of 15 (\"the IQ metric\"), we just place the gaps on that scale (i.e., *15 + 100), subtract the number of factors times 100, divide that by the square root of the sum of the elements in the correlation matrix (we'll use the American values, since their sample was larger), and add back 100.\nThe Kenyan sample, which was 1-2 SDs above the Kenyan average in terms of education, had a mean IQ score of 79.08 versus the American average of 100. The Ghanaian sample, which was 3-4 SDs above the Ghanaian average in terms of education, had a mean IQ of 92.32 versus the American average of 100. And do note, the American average the Ghanaian sample would be compared to would be lower than the average the Kenyan sample was compared to due to demographic change over time.\nThese estimates are much higher than Lynn’s, and that makes sense, because these are clearly socioeconomically extremely well-off samples, perhaps not by Western standards, but certainly by their own national standards. But some people think these are the sorts of samples that should be used to represent poor countries. That’s wrong, but the view has its supporters, like Wicherts, Dolan, Carlson and van der Maas, who claimed as much in 2010. But Lynn called this out at the time too:\n\nWicherts, Dolan, Carlson & van der Maas (WDCM) (2010) contend that the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa assessed by the Progressive Matrices is 78 in relation to a British mean of 100, Flynn effect corrected to 77, and reduced further to 76 to adjust for around 20% of Africans who do not attend school and are credited with an IQ of 71. This estimate is higher than the average of 67 proposed by Lynn and Vanhanen (2002, 2006) and Lynn (2006).\nThe crucial issues in estimating the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa concern the selection of studies of acceptable representative samples, and the adjustment of IQs obtained from unrepresentative samples to make them approximately representative. Many samples have been drawn from schools but these are a problem because significant numbers of children in sub-Saharan Africa have not attended schools during the last sixty years or so, and those who attend schools have higher average IQs than those who do not.\nLynn then reviewed general population studies and those returned a Sub-Saharan African mean IQ in the 60s. He subsequently reviewed primary school studies and the data yielded a median of 71, which he adjusted to 69 to account for the fact that only about 80% of the population gets a primary school education in Sub-Saharan Africa. After that, he reviewed studies of secondary school students, and those returned a mean IQ in the 70s, but that is not an acceptable estimate for a few simple reasons.\n\n(1) many adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa have not attended secondary school and tertiary institutes. For instance, Notcutt estimated that in South Africa in 1950 only about 25% of children aged 7-17 were in schools and “we cannot assume that those who are in school are a representative sample of the population”. (2) Entry to secondary school has generally been by competitive examination, resulting in those with higher IQs being selected for admission. Thus, “entry to secondary schools in the East African countries of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania is competitive… approximately 25 percent of the population complete the seven standards of primary school and there are secondary places for 10-12 percent of these”. Similarly, Silvey writing of Uganda around 1970 stated that at this time only 2% of children were admitted to secondary schools and entry is determined partly by a primary school leaving examination, and Heynman and Jamison writing of Uganda in 1972, note that admission to secondary school is based on “achievement performance on the academic selection examination… and there are secondary school places for only one child in 10”.\nThis is egregious, but this is typical for higher estimates for poor places. They tend to be based on samples that are, as in these cases, relatively privileged, pre-screened for IQ, etc., and despite that, still generally not that impressive in socioeconomic or IQ terms. These also aren’t the worst estimates like this that Lynn has noted. My favorite was this:\n\nWDCM include a number of studies that cannot be accepted for a variety of reasons. Their samples of university students are clearly unrepresentative. The Crawford-Nutt sample consisted of high school students (IQ 84) in math classes admission to which “is dependent on the degree of excellence of the pupil’s performance in the lower classes” and described as “a select segment of the population”. The students were also coached on how to do the test and “Teaching the strategies required to solve Matrix problems yields dramatic short-term gains in score”. This is clearly an unrepresentative sample.\nCuriously, people usually ‘get this’ sort of representativeness issue when it comes to things like China only sampling from rich, well-off areas to look good in international assessments like PISA and TIMSS, but they don’t get this when it applies to samples that look rich by one country’s standards and poor by the standards of the developed world. It’s precisely those sorts of large-scale examinations which bring me to the easiest way to vindicate Lynn’s sampling in a very general sense.\nLarge-scale international examinations like PISA have sampling frames, requirements to be met for a sample’s scores to be considered valid and comparable to those of other countries, and if countries meet them, then it’s likely their samples were sufficiently representative to make a statement about a country’s youth or, in the case of assessments like PIAAC, its adults. These large-scale assessments have standards for sampling, and they also have psychometric standards. Their samples end up representative—at least of developed countries (see above in this section)—and their test scores aren’t biased, and these still correlate highly with the results produced by Lynn and his colleagues. This is the basis for the World Bank’s HLOs, so by this point in this article, you’ve already seen this point made multiple times! And to be completely fair to Lynn, he made this point too, people just neglect that he did. It’s no doubt part of why he computed his own academic achievement test-based national IQs (see Footnote 3).\n“But IQs Below 60 Are Unrealistic!”\nSome people probably still think that some of Lynn’s estimates are too low. Lynn believed the same thing in cases where there just wasn’t enough data, which is why he Winsorized national IQ estimates and expressed his doubts about extremely low estimates. recently noted that sub-60 IQs also aren’t empirically supported. Through reviewing additional evidence on countries listed as having sub-60 IQs, he found that each one ended up with either no estimate (due to missingness) or an IQ above 60.\nThe unstated part of the argument that some national IQ estimates are unrealistically low is that somehow this disqualifies larger portions of the dataset, but that’s a non sequitur.\n“But Lynn Disadvantaged Poor Countries By Using Child Samples!”\nSome people have claimed that Lynn made poor countries appear to perform worse than they actually do by using samples of children instead of adults. This criticism reveals a lack of awareness that test scores have age-specific norms. But if we assume it’s a legitimate criticism, then it suggests Lynn unfairly advantaged poor countries since the existing not-so-strong evidence shows that those countries are more likely to have scores that decline relatively with age.\n\n“National IQs Suffer From Psychometric Bias!”\nDuring Lynn’s life, he didn’t focus much on psychometric bias. This is fair, because by the time it became a big focus for the field, he was already old. But in any case, as I’ve noted above, we have little reason to think it’s a big concern for most estimates. Furthermore, it’s not even clear that bias is systematic in general. Consider, for example, the comparison of Britons and South Africans I discussed here. In that comparison, there was bias, but it favored the lower-scoring South African group!\nIn general, when people find representative samples and no psychometric bias, the results aren’t different from what Lynn found, so unless someone wants to substantiate this concern, it’s little more than a waste of ink. 6\n\n“The Flynn Effect Means National IQs Are Liable to Change!”\nThe Flynn effect is widely misunderstood. I've written an article on this that goes into much greater depth about what I mean. But the important point when it comes to national IQs is that the Flynn effect is not about differences in intelligence, instead, it primarily concerns test bias. The existence of the Flynn effect also doesn’t imply there will be convergence between countries, it cannot be said to be the source of any convergence across countries without evidence that doesn’t currently exist, and the Flynn effect is explicitly adjusted for in national IQ computation. It just doesn’t have any relevance to the discussion because the evidence for larger Flynn effects during catch-up economic growth is extraordinarily poor.\nBut furthermore, increases in scores for cohorts over time will sometimes reflect bias rather than ability gains and relative cognitive performance across countries is generally very stable. There’s not really a reason to consider this argument, even for countries proposed—but not shown—to have major upward swings in their national IQ, like Ireland:\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\n\n“Lynn Gets the Causality Backwards From IQ to GDP!”\nWe know that IQ differences are partially causally explained by differences in brain size. Because development seemingly minimally impacts brain sizes —and it theoretically should not anyway —, brain sizes can be used successfully to instrument for national IQs, allowing us to estimate the causal impact of national IQs on outcomes like growth, crime rates, and so on. This has been done and it works well. The same result also turns up using ancestry-adjusted UVR and numeracy measured in the 19th century, both of which also can’t be caused by modern development.\nThese results suggest that if Lynn is getting the causality backwards from IQ to measures of national economic success, he’s still dominantly correct that national IQs precede development. Not only that, but national IQs are, as mentioned, largely stable over time, despite the world experiencing a lot of development. We can see this very directly using the World Bank’s HLOs again. The paper introducing them includes this diagram, showing (a) percentages enrolled in primary education over time, and (b) HLOs over the same period. Notice the dramatic increase in the former and relative stability of the latter. 7\n\nImage: Image\n\n\n\n\nSince we do know there’s a considerable degree of stability in measured national IQs, we can leverage stability as an assumption and see the curious result that, over time, it looks like Lynn’s estimates are vindicated more and more, because development measures have gotten more in line with his national IQs!\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, people who want to argue Lynn got causality backwards aren’t really taking issue with the national IQ estimates themselves, they’re just specifying an alternative claim that they hope sounds like it can invalidate Lynn’s estimates. But—and here’s the kicker—Lynn firmly believed that national IQs would increase with development; his estimates were point-in-time estimates, not the final letter forever and ever, and he fully expected them to change because he thought very poor places were environmentally disadvantaged. So this isn’t even really an argument against Lynn’s general views per se.\n\n“What About [Fake Data]?”\nPeople often reply to national IQ estimates with news articles, misinterpreted scientific articles, or nonsense sources that they allege show low-scoring countries actually do very well. Three examples that were brought up to me recently were Iran, India, and online IQ tests.\nThe example of Iran was a meta-analysis of different studies of Iranians. Someone brought this up to me to claim that Iran actually had a national IQ like America’s, at 97.12. Perplexed, I asked the simple question: Did they use American or British norms? And the answer is ‘no’, the test norms were Iranian, so if anything, these samples had an IQ below what’s expected—that is, a mean of 100. There’s really no need to ask further questions about these results, because being on different norms and not having the handbook handy to make the scores comparable means that they do not permit international comparisons. But this is a pretty standard sort of argument for people to make to contradict Lynn’s estimates.\nThe example of India was a news report about alleged testing of Indian students by Mensa’s India chapter. The report reads:\n\nIn the past couple of months, Mensa India, Delhi, administered its internationally recognized IQ test to over 4,000 underprivileged children in Delhi and NCR as part of a unique project aimed at identifying and mentoring poor children with high IQ. Of the 102 extremely bright children it selected, over a dozen, including Amisha, achieved an IQ score of 145-plus, which puts her in the genius category.\nThe others achieved IQ scores of 130-145, which puts them in the category of ‘very gifted’ children. The average score in Mensa India’s IQ test is between 85 and 115. Interestingly, all of these children are sons and daughters of labourers, rickshaw pullers, security guards, street vendors, etc.\nNow, does this say anything in defiance of Lynn’s numbers? No, because we don’t know the norms. We don’t even know much about these statistics at all, we just have hearsay without accompanying statistics. This barely rises above an anecdote, but it is the sort of thing that people will misinterpret to mean Lynn was wrong, somehow.\nThe online IQ test argument is one of the silliest, but it gives people a lot of hope. They argue that test results such as these, produced by people self-selecting into taking tests of unknown and— when vetted —dubious validity suggest that national IQ estimates are way off the mark. But they don’t do that, because they’re based on selective rather than representative samples. Relatedly, people sometimes argue that national IQ estimates are wrong because international students taking American tests like the GRE perform better than, say, Americans, when the national IQ of their country of origin is lower than America’s. But once again, this test-taking is selective, making it less relevant than proponents of using that data to reject national IQs might hope.\nAnother less common strategy to reject national IQs is to just unreasonably ignore data. For example, today I encountered someone who plotted Haiti’s national IQ over time with two datapoints, one from the late-1940s and the other from the late-1970s. They alleged that Haiti had gotten much smarter over time, with their national IQ rising from around 60 to almost 100. But looking at all available data, this view cannot be supported. What they did to make their claim isn’t even a reasonable way to compute a national IQ. Getting a national IQ estimate requires looking at multiple lines of evidence and qualifying the inclusion of samples and whatnot, whereas their strategy was to act like there were just two studies to discuss and to conclude that the later one was the ground-truth regardless of its reliability or any other of its qualities.\n\n“National IQs Don’t Measure Differences in Intelligence!”\nThis complaint takes two forms. The first is the more general rejection of intelligence tests measuring intelligence. That’s not relevant to national IQs and it’s poorly supported, but the arguments on that topic are familiar, so I’ll skip to the relevant argument.\nThe second form is that, for some reason, differences in national IQs are due to different factors than those that explain test performance within populations. This perspective is incompatible with measurement invariance, so it is necessarily wrong for any psychometrically unbiased comparisons. A sense in which the claim can be recovered is that for a given unbiased comparison, there might be mean differences in specific factors rather than in g —a sort of international versions of the contra hypothesis for Spearman’s hypothesis. This is not the case for the PISA tests or any other unbiased national IQ comparison of which I’m aware, so while it’s a possible perspective, it’s empirically contradicted at the moment.\nSome people prefer achievement tests to national IQs, despite the positive manifold strongly suggesting that achievement tests and IQ tests both measure g 8, and confirmatory factor modeling confirming that. The people with that preference also tend to make another, related argument: that achievement tests are not measures of g and cannot be treated as such. But like the above arguments, there are only negative reasons to think this is true for international examinations like the PISA tests, which have a strong general dimension, much like standard IQ tests.\n\nCriticisms of National IQs Are Intellectually Lazy\nPeople really want national IQ estimates to be debunked or, worse, to feel personally favorable. So they concoct a lot of bad arguments to make it sound like national IQs are off. To recap, here are some of the ways:\n\nThey confuse themselves and others about how mental retardation is defined and act as though it’s defined by IQ alone, so certain national IQs must be implausible. In doing so, they ignore the importance and existence of norms, as well as the modern definition of mental retardation itself.\n\nThey claim methodological choices like imputation are extraordinarily biasing when that is not the case and checking shows that the choice is actually not even biasing in the direction of national IQs being unfair to the groups national IQs have been proposed to illustrate bias against.\n\nThey claim that sampling is directionally biased in a certain way, when inspection of the data generally shows that, if anything, it’s biased in a way that leads to understated lower-tail cognitive differentiation.\n\nThey make claims that ‘sound right’ like that comparing children and adults is bad, even when we have age-based norms, so this cannot be a genuine criticism unless it is theoretically qualified that somehow children in certain countries are more disadvantaged than their adults and that this disadvantage translates to lower cognitive performance. I’m not aware of anyone who believes this theoretical qualifier and existing evidence speaks against it.\n\nThey make groundless extrapolations like ‘The Flynn effect means national IQs are worthless’ or ‘national IQs have changed a lot’ and they refuse to justify these inferences.\n\nThey look for odd references and outlier studies to justify throwing out a whole corpus of material.\n\nEtc.\nThe common thread between different national IQ criticisms is the weaponization of ignorance. Critics toss out claims they think are right or which sound right, and they don’t check their work. A stand-out example is that people regularly say that Lynn was biased against Sub-Saharan Africans on the basis of his use of samples that are well-off by the standards of their countries purely because they are poor by the standards of the developed world. But this argument cannot stand. It has no merit, and it only serves to insult the reader and to convince them that the person making the argument has done some of the required work to dismiss Lynn’s estimates, when they’ve really only done the required work to say they’ve just barely cracked open the book!\nAfter throwing out enough criticisms, people feel that national IQ estimates simply cannot stand, that they must be wrong, or so many criticisms wouldn’t be possible in the first place. But on this they’re wrong, and the very fact that they have so many criticisms is a strike against them, because the criticisms are so uniformly bad that they should embarrass the person making them. Making matters worse, critics seem to never go back when they’re shown to be wrong. Their attempted debunkings get roundly debunked and national IQ estimates remain reliable as ever, and they just keep making the same tired arguments that no right-minded person could still believe.\nThe defining feature of criticisms of national IQs is not all of this lazy argument though, it’s what comes next: insults. People like Lynn are taken to be ‘stupid’, people who believe in a given estimate that upsets people regardless of how well-supported it is are taken to be ‘morons’, and looking into and understanding national IQ estimates becomes less common because, after all, the only people who would look into them are the sorts of ‘stupid moron racists’ who actually bother to check their work.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Concerns?\nThink I missed any big arguments? Want more details about something I said? Need something explained? Noticed a grammatical error, spelling mistake, or other triviality? Think I’m right or wrong about some claim? Have more data for me to look at?\nThen tell me, because this is a living post that will be updated over time.\n\nNow enjoy the most up-to-date national IQ map. It’s imputation-free!\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nJensen and Kirkegaard 2024\n1\n\nThese are technical terms. It should be clear that I am not saying that “idiopathic” is defined as “severe” or vice-versa, but some people have reading comprehension difficulties so I’m saying this explicitly.\n2\n\nYou can also use the Human Capital Index, the Basic Skills Dataset, World Bank Test Scores, Learning-Adjusted Years of Schooling, Rosetta Stone Scores, and many more. They’re interchangeable with or without overlapping underlying data.\n3\n\nLynn only imputed 51 national IQs in 2019 and there weren’t many entries in the imputed list shared with the HLO dataset, although the results for the current best national IQs were similar to the correlations with the 2002 and 2012 imputed national IQs ( r= 0.73). Warne noted that these imputed national IQs had only modest or, in a case where the n = just 8, a negative correlation with other measures, so they might be unsuitable. In his own words:\n\nThe weak or negative correlations between these geographically imputed IQs and the achievement test data from some of those countries is a major cause of concern and makes it hard to identify any valid interpretation of these IQ scores.\nSo my recommendation if you’re unhappy with these national IQs is to just use the dataset without imputations. Lynn’s dataset includes documentation of all studies included, methodological decisions, and six different national IQs affected by different methodological choices, so this is easy. These are, in Warne’s words:\n\n\nAn unweighted mean of all adjusted IQs for each sample within a country,\n\nA mean of all adjusted IQs weighted by the size of each sample within a country,\n\nA mean of all adjusted IQs weighted by the size and quality of each sample within a country,\n\nA mean IQ based on educational achievement data from the TIMSS, PIRLS, or PISA tests\n\nAn unweighted mean of the previous two estimates IQs (IQ + Achievement), and\n\nA mean equal to either [5] or a mean imputed from neighboring countries that do have IQ data.\nThe adjustments mentioned are for the Flynn effect and the country a test is normed in.\n4\n\nTo make this point they would also have to ignore that Lynn is the person who popularized the finding that Asians have higher average IQs than Whites.\n5\n\nThe reality that poor countries will have poor samples if they’re going to have representative samples has to be caveated in a way that actually leaves Lynn looking good. This is the case because, in order to take part in, say, a verbal test, you have to be able to read, to have a modicum of education. Because education is not the norm, in many areas, that means that valid samples of the sort Lynn would use because they could produce plausible scores will necessarily overrepresent the skills of people in very poor places.\nBut, thankfully, this may not be too concerning in many places in the developing world. This is a point I’ve made before. Regardless, if it were concerning, it would be quantitatively concerning, and adjustments could be made to account for it.\n6\n\nIt’s also something Lynn was concerned about, albeit from the angle that he should use tests more likely to be ‘culture-free’ like Raven’s matrices rather than, say, vocabulary tests.\n7\n\nUsing the HLOs for 2010, 2017, 2018, and 2020, a cross-lagged panel model suggests minimal impacts of GDP PPP Per Capita on HLOs, but consistently finds impacts of HLOs on subsequent years’ GDPs. It’s not clear this is meaningful, because there are only four years, they’re close together, GDP should probably have its returns on further removed cohorts from the year of GDP measurement, and the last year in the sample is the start of the COVID pandemic, which disrupted economies and education systems alike. With this model and robust standard errors, I found just one significant GDP to HLO effect, from 2018 to 2020 ( p= 0.005). HLOCLPM <- '\n# Regressions for HLO and GDP across time\nHLO_Score_2017 ~ HLO_Score_2010 + GDP_2010\nGDP_2017 ~ HLO_Score_2010 + GDP_2010\nHLO_Score_2018 ~ HLO_Score_2017 + GDP_2017\nGDP_2018 ~ HLO_Score_2017 + GDP_2017\nHLO_Score_2020 ~ HLO_Score_2018 + GDP_2018\nGDP_2020 ~ HLO_Score_2018 + GDP_2018\n# Correlated residuals\nHLO_Score_2010 ~~ GDP_2010\nHLO_Score_2017 ~~ GDP_2017\nHLO_Score_2018 ~~ GDP_2018\nHLO_Score_2020 ~~ GDP_2020\n'\n8\n\nThe distinction has to be qualified to be properly understood.

Quote: &#8220;The business model of the healthcare industry is to deny care&#8212;necessary medical care to people who need it&#8212;and [to] force them into bankruptcy, or worse let them die, in order to grow a profit.&#8221;</p><p>He says he <em>knows all this</em>, and millions of Americans <em>know it</em>. But they do not &#8220;know this&#8221; and they cannot &#8220;know this&#8221; because it is not and cannot be true.</p><div><hr></div><p>If you know the most basic healthcare statistics for the U.S.&#8212;like life expectancies, mortality numbers from different conditions and at different ages, denial rates and reasons and so on&#8212;then you realize that Senator Murphy&#8217;s is an impossible claim. But in case you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll explain why while being generous to his position and still taking him seriously given the power of his position and the duty holding that position puts on him to do his due diligence before addressing the American people as he did a few days ago.</p><p>Firstly, Senator Murphy claims that &#8220;thousands of people&#8221; die &#8220;every single day&#8221; due to the denial of care. If we set &#8220;thousands&#8221; to the minimum it can be, then we get to 730,000 annual deaths due to the denial of care by a system that &#8220;only cares about profits&#8221;. He was being hyperbolic, but, two things: there are plenty of people who share his exactly-stated view&#8212;ignorance is common&#8212;, and he&#8217;s a Senator, someone who represents millions of Americans, so he should own the things he says. We ought to take him seriously because he is in one of the world&#8217;s most important positions.</p><p>The qualifier he provided, that denial deaths are driven by a system that &#8220;only cares about profits&#8221;, is critical, because it means that almost all deaths after age 65 do not count. When people turn 65, they qualify for Medicare. <a href=\"https://archive.md/Smbxo\">Medicare is the reason why virtually everyone over that age is covered</a>. Not only that, but Medicare means that the elderly are covered by a system without a profit motive on the insurer&#8217;s part, since the insurer&#8217;s role in Medicare is filled by the government.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"855\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:684,&quot;width&quot;:960,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Infographic: Young Americans Most Likely to Lack Healthcare Coverage | Statista&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-large\" alt=\"Infographic: Young Americans Most Likely to Lack Healthcare Coverage | Statista\" title=\"Infographic: Young Americans Most Likely to Lack Healthcare Coverage | Statista\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F25c65d33-3934-40e1-bea7-913781ad9139_960x684.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\"><a href=\"https://archive.md/7gaLs\">Buchholz 2019</a>.

Then count out homicides, and it&#8217;s probably fair to just count out suicides too, since insurance denial is not really a documented correlate of suicide and the age groups with lots of suicides usually have fine coverage, but also for another reason I&#8217;ll get to in a moment. With all that out, we&#8217;re down to 625,979 deaths.</p><p>The next issue is that lots of young Americans are insured by another government insurance plan, Medicaid.</p><div

It is necessarily selective about who gets enrolled, leading to confounded estimates of the cross-sectional mortality delta associated with Medicaid versus private insurance. But this isn&#8217;t relevant for our purposes, because we just want to know how much of the under-65 death we can be cross-sectionally attributed to private insurance plans, and for that, all we need to know is the mortality delta associated with Medicaid, confounded or otherwise.</p><p>Interpreting mortality under age 65 as being due to profit-driven denial of care was already hard to do, but with Medicaid and the high mortality of Medicaid enrollees noted, it should be <em>very </em>hard to do. To make this clearer, let&#8217;s look at the mortality for people under one year of age.</p><p>The top causes of death for &lt;1-year-olds are largely things that happen around birth, like deaths from short gestation or intrauterine hypoxia, not really things that can be attributed to insurance denials, since care is already being provided at that point and it won&#8217;t be stopped and it&#8217;s obviously unlikely that a parent would call for it to be stopped regardless of cost. <a href=\"https://archive.md/SNopn\">About 41% of all births in the U.S. happen to mothers with Medicaid coverage</a>, and as noted above, their infant mortality rates are considerably higher than the rates for insured mothers.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> If we say that 41% * 1.15 = 47.2% of these deaths are Medicaid deaths and we keep the rest as private insurance deaths, then the plausibly profit-driven share of deaths declines by a few thousand, but if we were being maximally realistic, it should probably still go down even more.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><p>A lot of the deaths for people under one year of age are not preventable by the healthcare system. A denial shouldn&#8217;t matter for SIDS, sepsis, a neonatal hemorrhage, atelectasis, hydrops fetalis, delivery complications, and so on. Frankly, a lot of these need to be removed given the coverage mix (about half) and the feasibility of the system intervening for these conditions (the overwhelming majority of the remaining half!), but let&#8217;s be <em>exceedingly</em> generous to Senator Murphy&#8217;s position and just cut out half<em>, </em>and, at that, only half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, excluding what we&#8217;ve already parceled out. That reduces the death count from 625,979 to 618,999.</p><p>We then need to apply this logic to deaths from ages 1-64 too, because after all, how exactly is the healthcare system supposed to intervene on, say, diabetes, in a way it doesn&#8217;t already? And given the low socioeconomic status and thus high probability of Medicaid coverage for those who die below 65 years of age from causes like diabetes and heart disease, how can we chalk this up to the profit motive of insurers? I&#8217;m almost-certainly being <em>extremely </em>generous to Senator Murphy&#8217;s position by <em>only </em>counting out half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, and doing that brings us down to&#8230; 369,635 deaths.</p><p>And we&#8217;re not done scaling this down. We still ought to scale this down to account for medical care received by the small portion of people who are uninsured, who are not suffering through care denials <em>at the hands of insurers</em>. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221653/\">The uninsured use care at lower rates than people with insurance</a>, but their usage rates are far from zero. If we were to say, flatly and generously, that the uninsured use medical care at 25% of the rate of the insured ignoring that they would use critical care at more comparable rates, then we would cut deaths below age 19 by 5.8% * 0.25 and between 19 and 64 by 10.9% * 0.25, bringing us down to less than half what Senator Murphy proposed, and we&#8217;re not even done whittling down that number!</p><p>But I suggest we don&#8217;t go further than this. We haven&#8217;t exhausted the sources of public insurance coverage (cut another ~8%-12% from the initial number to cut from depending on how you treat Tricare), and we&#8217;ve been excessively generous with how treatable we&#8217;ve considered different causes of death, and it is already impossible to achieve Senator Murphy&#8217;s stated numbers. It is impossible to even support 1,000 profit-driven denial-based deaths per day! After all is said and done, even the estimate I&#8217;ve produced is <em>still</em> a major overestimate, but going further merely adds insult to injury.</p><p>So how might we figure out a good estimate?</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>A Message From My Sponsor</em></h3><p>Steve Jobs is quoted as saying, &#8220;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

Benefits</h3><p>If we take Senator Murphy&#8217;s implied numbers seriously, then almost all non-homicide, accident, or suicide deaths for the young should be attributable to care denials and, accordingly, we should see an almost total elimination of mortality when nonelderly people obtain reliable access to medical care. The implied effect Senator Murphy stated would see doctor strikes having a near-genocidal impact<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a>, it means Medicaid expansions should be majorly life-extending for the population, and when people gain access to care in other ways, practically any study should be able to show us huge benefits to mortality.</p><p>Let&#8217;s open up our handy-dandy copy of Joseph Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group&#8217;s <em>Free for All</em>?, turn it to page 211, and notice that in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment the book documents&#8212;in which people were given free health insurance&#8212;there was no effect whatsoever on overall mortality. There were two marginally-significant effects for &#8220;all elevated-risk persons&#8221; (<em>p</em> = 0.03) and for &#8220;elevated-risk and low-income persons&#8221; (<em>p</em> = 0.049), but if we believe these are real, they&#8217;re still <em>far </em>too small to justify Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims, and it&#8217;s not clear these findings would hold since the mortality benefits were <em>apparently </em>driven by blood pressure control and modern health plans cover blood pressure medication very well. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/20/4/348/141573\">In fact, private plans cover it as well as Medicare and Medicaid</a>.</p><p>Newhouse also evaluated another free insurance experiment, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which people became able to receive Medicaid via a lottery. Whereas Senator Murphy predicts a <em>huge </em>effect on mortality immediately because denied care is critical to living, the reality of the experiment was that <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\">there was no effect on mortality (</a><em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\">p</a></em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\"> = 0.638) at one year in</a>.

But not too much more doubtful, since the Indian study participants seem to have been affected by a lack of awareness of how insurance works.</p><p>If we look at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240828091637/https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26533/w26533.pdf\">a more optimistic estimate based on IRS notifications to get insured</a>, we get a 0.06pp reduction in mortality among those aged 45-64 years of age who received a letter. This was marginally significant with a huge sample size, so it&#8217;s a result that&#8217;s more likely under the null. When I pointed this out to the author, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">he responded by restating the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">p</a></em><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">-value</a> as if that somehow made the result more believable. I am not sure why this would impress anyone, but I know saying a <em>p-</em>value twice <em>does </em>impress some people, so I can&#8217;t discount the strategy.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a> A further problem with this is that this result is just for individuals aged 45-64 and we&#8217;re never presented with the results for individuals who are younger, but we are presented with estimated impacts on coverage, and we know those ages got covered less (but still a significant, positive amount) in response to IRS letters. We don&#8217;t know if it was statistically appropriate to split the sample by age because the authors provided insufficient documentation of their results, unless I missed something in a table somewhere. In any case, this stated result is in a higher-mortality age bracket than the bracket &lt;65-years-old which we&#8217;re interested in for evaluating Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims. For the rest of that bracket, below 45-64, this study found &#8220;no evidence that the intervention reduced mortality&#8230; over our sample period.&#8221;</p><p>There are other studies that have looked at the impacts of expanded coverage too. For example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/111/2/431/1938390\">Currie and Gruber</a> estimated that Medicaid eligibility expansion by 15.1pp between 1984 and 1992 reduced child mortality by 5.1%. <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1202099\">Sommers et al.</a> found that Medicaid expansions between 1997 and 2007 increased Medicaid coverage, decreased rates of being uninsured, decreased rates of delayed care, and led to significant reductions in all-cause mortality on the order of -6.1%. <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M13-2275\">A later paper by Sommers et al.</a> estimated<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> that Massachusetts&#8217; 2006 healthcare reform that pushed the state to near-universal healthcare reduced all-cause mortality by 2.9% and drove down deaths from causes amenable to healthcare intervention by 4.5%.</p><p>The ACA allowed Medicaid to be expanded substantially starting in 2014, and since then, there have been several evaluations of the mortality benefits to expanded coverage. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/136/3/1783/6124639\">Miller, Johnson and Wherry</a> looked at ACA expansions across several states and focused in on the high-mortality population of people aged 55 to 64, finding a 7.0% reduction in year 0 and an 11.9% reduction by year 3 post-expansion. In aggregate, they documented an 8.1% reduction in morality relative to an estimated counterfactual mortality rate. The reductions in mortality for those aged 53-58 and aged 65 and older were nonsignificant. The reductions really set in only for those aged 59-64: old, but pre-Medicare.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-11\" href=\"#footnote-11\" target=\"_self\">11</a> <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00252-8/fulltext\">For</a> <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/building-on-the-evidence-base-studies-on-the-effects-of-medicaid-expansion-february-2020-to-march-2021-report/\">a more general estimate</a> of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241123041427/https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/inline-files/Wyse_CensusMedicaid.pdf\">the mortality reduction from the ACA&#8217;s</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241212094845/https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2021/06/22/the-effects-of-earlier-medicaid-expansions-a-literature-review/\">Medicaid expansions</a>, see <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629619306228\">Borgschulte and Vogler</a>, who estimated a decline of 3.6%.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-12\" href=\"#footnote-12\" target=\"_self\">12</a></p><p>I don&#8217;t wish to make this section any longer, so I&#8217;ll say this: I&#8217;ve shown that insurance coverage matters, but the best evidence also strongly suggests that Senator Murphy <em>cannot be right</em>. The estimates based on providing free insurance, Medicaid expansions, IRS notifications, and other reforms suggest that increasing insurance has small-to-modest effects on mortality <em>among at-risk populations</em>, not that it has the gobsmackingly huge effects that Senator Murphy suggested it should <em>among the whole population</em>. And these are largely the effects of going from being <em>uninsured</em> to being <em>insured</em>, not from the more operative <em>going from being</em> <em>insured with necessary care being denied</em> to <em>being</em> <em>insured with necessary care not being denied</em>. Since going from being uninsured to being insured almost-certainly matters more than going from being poorly to less-poorly insured, and the effect of going from no insurance to some insurance (which mostly means public, not-for-profit insurance) is <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240727133340/https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds\">nowhere near enough</a></em>. Being generous, Senator Murphy was probably off by more than an order of magnitude. There is simply no way to credibly argue for Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Are You OK?</h3><p>There is simply no way Senator Murphy could honestly support his conclusion that thousands die every day due to medical care being denied to support profits. Let&#8217;s review.</p><p>For one, there aren&#8217;t that many people denied care, and no one directly dies due to an insurer denial because you can&#8217;t even be denied healthcare for an emergency at the point of care.</p><p>For two, even if you take <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241216085326/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/\">confounded cross-sectional estimates</a> of the impact of being <em>uninsured</em>&#8212;which has a much larger impact on healthcare utilization than being poorly insured&#8212;on mortality, it&#8217;s insufficient to explain anywhere near a large enough portion of all deaths.</p><p>For three, too few deaths happen among those with private insurance alone for his claims to be true.</p><p>For four, there aren&#8217;t enough deaths from medically preventable causes at the right ages for his claims to be true.</p><p>For <em>N</em>, we can go on! There are so many lines of evidence that Senator Murphy should have known that would have disconfirmed his claim, and yet there he was, making it before an audience of millions.</p><div><hr></div><p>Politicians are infamously dishonest. A lot of that probably has to do with just being ignorant. Politicians usually aren&#8217;t exceptionally brilliant people, and there&#8217;s no end to the reporting on their dumb gaffes and mistakes. Given his statements, it&#8217;s clear that Senator Murphy is no exception, and he would have benefited from checking his numbers and having someone there to give him a sanity check before he opened his mouth. More generally, every politician should have this when it&#8217;s time to make empirical claims.</p><p>But being wrong about healthcare isn&#8217;t Senator Murphy&#8217;s worst sin. There&#8217;s a far more fundamental and pressing issue with Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims than just being wrong. His video&#8217;s entire purpose was to turn a senseless murder into a call for action against people whose harms he was actively exaggerating. His goal with  the video was to vindicate violence by way of people feeling aggrieved over a problem that <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/grading-the-worlds-shortest-manifesto\">neither the killer</a> nor he seem to understand.</p><p>Imagine if a sitting Senator who started their Congressional tenure in 2024 was killed in cold blood over an issue like <em>U.S. military bases in Iraq</em>. One could argue that people are disheartened and fed up with American military deployments and the Congressmen who contributed to them. By Senator Murphy&#8217;s standards, such a murder would be justified. To quote him: &#8220;People in America today feel ignored, they feel scared, they feel alone in a system that intentionally grinds them down. A system where profit matters more than life. My colleagues need to listen and we need to do something about it.&#8221;</p><p>My suggestion for Senator Murphy&#8217;s &#8220;something&#8221; is to be a little more sane, to get a lot more informed, and to be much less sensitive to the half-baked arguments of psychopaths who kill Americans in cold blood. Maybe then he can start to fix the healthcare system.</p><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Notably, this applies to Medicare-participating hospitals and you cannot reasonably blame the healthcare system for the very small number of cases where people do not pursue critical care because they believe they won&#8217;t be able to pay for it.

      "script_text": "This post is brought to you by my sponsor, Warp.\n\nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy does not have even a basic understanding of American health statistics.\nOn December 15th in a video he posted to the social media platform X, he claimed that “thousands of people… die often anonymous deaths every single day in this country at the hands of a healthcare industry that mostly doesn’t give a shit about people and only cares about profits.” He noted that there were exceptions in the form of good people like “nurses, doctors” and he castigated a system that “pad[s] profits and make[s] money for the people who run the biggest companies”, likely referring to UnitedHealthcare and other large health insurers. Quote: “The business model of the healthcare industry is to deny care—necessary medical care to people who need it—and [to] force them into bankruptcy, or worse let them die, in order to grow a profit.”\nHe says he knows all this, and millions of Americans know it. But they do not “know this” and they cannot “know this” because it is not and cannot be true.\n\nIf you know the most basic healthcare statistics for the U.S.—like life expectancies, mortality numbers from different conditions and at different ages, denial rates and reasons and so on—then you realize that Senator Murphy’s is an impossible claim. But in case you don’t, I’ll explain why while being generous to his position and still taking him seriously given the power of his position and the duty holding that position puts on him to do his due diligence before addressing the American people as he did a few days ago.\nFirstly, Senator Murphy claims that “thousands of people” die “every single day” due to the denial of care. If we set “thousands” to the minimum it can be, then we get to 730,000 annual deaths due to the denial of care by a system that “only cares about profits”. He was being hyperbolic, but, two things: there are plenty of people who share his exactly-stated view—ignorance is common—, and he’s a Senator, someone who represents millions of Americans, so he should own the things he says. We ought to take him seriously because he is in one of the world’s most important positions.\nThe qualifier he provided, that denial deaths are driven by a system that “only cares about profits”, is critical, because it means that almost all deaths after age 65 do not count. When people turn 65, they qualify for Medicare. Medicare is the reason why virtually everyone over that age is covered. Not only that, but Medicare means that the elderly are covered by a system without a profit motive on the insurer’s part, since the insurer’s role in Medicare is filled by the government.\n\nImage: Infographic: Young Americans Most Likely to Lack Healthcare Coverage | Statista\n\n\n\nBuchholz 2019. Note that this is merely illustrative and more recent data show comparable or slightly higher aggregate insurance coverage rates.\nI am reasonably certain that Senator Murphy does not believe Medicare is a broken system that kills Americans with denials since the fee-for-service (FFS) variant minimally uses prior authorization and Advantage outperforms FFS while operating within strict constraints set by CMS. Senator Murphy is a champion of ‘Medicare-for-All’, so for consistency, we have to cut virtually all deaths over age 65 from the possible deaths that can be attributed to denials.\nIf we look through causes of death by age in 2022, then we see that cutting out even just the top-20 causes of death for those aged 65+ means losing 1,984,199 deaths out of 2022’s total of… 3,279,857. We’re losing just over 60% of the deaths and leaving ourselves with 1,295,658 to pull at least 730,000 from, and that’s not even counting out all of the deaths over age 65! But let’s be accurate and go all the way with removing deaths over age 65, bringing us down to 853,082 from which to pull 730,000.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nWISQARS\nNext we need to whittle down the remaining deaths, because many of them are clearly not plausibly driven by denials. For example, deaths due to unintentional injury and homicide are not being driven by denials because people cannot be denied emergency care thanks to EMTALA. 1 In 2022, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death for ages 1-44, it was #4 for individuals <1 years of age, and it was #3 for ages 45-64. Then count out homicides, and it’s probably fair to just count out suicides too, since insurance denial is not really a documented correlate of suicide and the age groups with lots of suicides usually have fine coverage, but also for another reason I’ll get to in a moment. With all that out, we’re down to 625,979 deaths.\nThe next issue is that lots of young Americans are insured by another government insurance plan, Medicaid.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nLink\nThis cuts against the profit driven denial-induced mortality explanation offered by Senator Murphy. 2 This also makes it harder to interpret the remaining deaths because they disproportionately affect those enrolled in Medicaid. For example, relative to those with private insurance, people with Medicaid are more suicidal. 3 People on Medicaid also have much higher infant mortality rates than people with private insurance do, they have higher mortality in very diverse settings, and their mortality rates are, in general, higher. Medicaid also enrolls disproportionately many people with disabilities, and wherever you look, disability is associated with mortality. Medicaid is also disproportionately used by American Indians and Blacks, whose nonelderly mortality rates are much higher than the rates for Whites at the same ages. 4\nIt’s unlikely that the greater mortality seen among Medicaid enrollees just reflects the quality of care they receive, because it is a program for low-income persons. It is necessarily selective about who gets enrolled, leading to confounded estimates of the cross-sectional mortality delta associated with Medicaid versus private insurance. But this isn’t relevant for our purposes, because we just want to know how much of the under-65 death we can be cross-sectionally attributed to private insurance plans, and for that, all we need to know is the mortality delta associated with Medicaid, confounded or otherwise.\nInterpreting mortality under age 65 as being due to profit-driven denial of care was already hard to do, but with Medicaid and the high mortality of Medicaid enrollees noted, it should be very hard to do. To make this clearer, let’s look at the mortality for people under one year of age.\nThe top causes of death for <1-year-olds are largely things that happen around birth, like deaths from short gestation or intrauterine hypoxia, not really things that can be attributed to insurance denials, since care is already being provided at that point and it won’t be stopped and it’s obviously unlikely that a parent would call for it to be stopped regardless of cost. About 41% of all births in the U.S. happen to mothers with Medicaid coverage, and as noted above, their infant mortality rates are considerably higher than the rates for insured mothers. 5 If we say that 41% * 1.15 = 47.2% of these deaths are Medicaid deaths and we keep the rest as private insurance deaths, then the plausibly profit-driven share of deaths declines by a few thousand, but if we were being maximally realistic, it should probably still go down even more. 6\nA lot of the deaths for people under one year of age are not preventable by the healthcare system. A denial shouldn’t matter for SIDS, sepsis, a neonatal hemorrhage, atelectasis, hydrops fetalis, delivery complications, and so on. Frankly, a lot of these need to be removed given the coverage mix (about half) and the feasibility of the system intervening for these conditions (the overwhelming majority of the remaining half!), but let’s be exceedingly generous to Senator Murphy’s position and just cut out half, and, at that, only half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, excluding what we’ve already parceled out. That reduces the death count from 625,979 to 618,999.\nWe then need to apply this logic to deaths from ages 1-64 too, because after all, how exactly is the healthcare system supposed to intervene on, say, diabetes, in a way it doesn’t already? And given the low socioeconomic status and thus high probability of Medicaid coverage for those who die below 65 years of age from causes like diabetes and heart disease, how can we chalk this up to the profit motive of insurers? I’m almost-certainly being extremely generous to Senator Murphy’s position by only counting out half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, and doing that brings us down to… 369,635 deaths.\nAnd we’re not done scaling this down. We still ought to scale this down to account for medical care received by the small portion of people who are uninsured, who are not suffering through care denials at the hands of insurers. The uninsured use care at lower rates than people with insurance, but their usage rates are far from zero. If we were to say, flatly and generously, that the uninsured use medical care at 25% of the rate of the insured ignoring that they would use critical care at more comparable rates, then we would cut deaths below age 19 by 5.8% * 0.25 and between 19 and 64 by 10.9% * 0.25, bringing us down to less than half what Senator Murphy proposed, and we’re not even done whittling down that number!\nBut I suggest we don’t go further than this. We haven’t exhausted the sources of public insurance coverage (cut another ~8%-12% from the initial number to cut from depending on how you treat Tricare), and we’ve been excessively generous with how treatable we’ve considered different causes of death, and it is already impossible to achieve Senator Murphy’s stated numbers. It is impossible to even support 1,000 profit-driven denial-based deaths per day! After all is said and done, even the estimate I’ve produced is still a major overestimate, but going further merely adds insult to injury.\nSo how might we figure out a good estimate?\n\nA Message From My Sponsor\nSteve Jobs is quoted as saying, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

The implied effect Senator Murphy stated would see doctor strikes having a near-genocidal impact 7, it means Medicaid expansions should be majorly life-extending for the population, and when people gain access to care in other ways, practically any study should be able to show us huge benefits to mortality.\nLet’s open up our handy-dandy copy of Joseph Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group’s Free for All?, turn it to page 211, and notice that in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment the book documents—in which people were given free health insurance—there was no effect whatsoever on overall mortality. There were two marginally-significant effects for “all elevated-risk persons” ( p= 0.03) and for “elevated-risk and low-income persons” ( p= 0.049), but if we believe these are real, they’re still far too small to justify Senator Murphy’s claims, and it’s not clear these findings would hold since the mortality benefits were apparently driven by blood pressure control and modern health plans cover blood pressure medication very well. In fact, private plans cover it as well as Medicare and Medicaid.\nNewhouse also evaluated another free insurance experiment, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which people became able to receive Medicaid via a lottery. Whereas Senator Murphy predicts a huge effect on mortality immediately because denied care is critical to living, the reality of the experiment was that there was no effect on mortality ( p= 0.638) at one year in. At two years, mortality didn’t even get a mention.\nA deeper issue with this approach is suggested by the evidence that giving out free hospital insurance in the very poor setting of India didn’t impact mortality ( p= 0.838) at 3.5 years post-intervention. 8 If gaining access to hospital care doesn’t even materially affect mortality in a setting with extremely limited utilization of care—both before and after receiving free insurance!—, effects in America should be considered more doubtful. But not too much more doubtful, since the Indian study participants seem to have been affected by a lack of awareness of how insurance works.\nIf we look at a more optimistic estimate based on IRS notifications to get insured, we get a 0.06pp reduction in mortality among those aged 45-64 years of age who received a letter. This was marginally significant with a huge sample size, so it’s a result that’s more likely under the null. When I pointed this out to the author, he responded by restating the p-value as if that somehow made the result more believable. I am not sure why this would impress anyone, but I know saying a p- value twice does impress some people, so I can’t discount the strategy. 9 A further problem with this is that this result is just for individuals aged 45-64 and we’re never presented with the results for individuals who are younger, but we are presented with estimated impacts on coverage, and we know those ages got covered less (but still a significant, positive amount) in response to IRS letters. We don’t know if it was statistically appropriate to split the sample by age because the authors provided insufficient documentation of their results, unless I missed something in a table somewhere. In any case, this stated result is in a higher-mortality age bracket than the bracket <65-years-old which we’re interested in for evaluating Senator Murphy’s claims. For the rest of that bracket, below 45-64, this study found “no evidence that the intervention reduced mortality… over our sample period.”\nThere are other studies that have looked at the impacts of expanded coverage too. For example, Currie and Gruber estimated that Medicaid eligibility expansion by 15.1pp between 1984 and 1992 reduced child mortality by 5.1%. Sommers et al. found that Medicaid expansions between 1997 and 2007 increased Medicaid coverage, decreased rates of being uninsured, decreased rates of delayed care, and led to significant reductions in all-cause mortality on the order of -6.1%. A later paper by Sommers et al. estimated 10 that Massachusetts’ 2006 healthcare reform that pushed the state to near-universal healthcare reduced all-cause mortality by 2.9% and drove down deaths from causes amenable to healthcare intervention by 4.5%.\nThe ACA allowed Medicaid to be expanded substantially starting in 2014, and since then, there have been several evaluations of the mortality benefits to expanded coverage. Miller, Johnson and Wherry looked at ACA expansions across several states and focused in on the high-mortality population of people aged 55 to 64, finding a 7.0% reduction in year 0 and an 11.9% reduction by year 3 post-expansion. In aggregate, they documented an 8.1% reduction in morality relative to an estimated counterfactual mortality rate. The reductions in mortality for those aged 53-58 and aged 65 and older were nonsignificant. The reductions really set in only for those aged 59-64: old, but pre-Medicare. 11 For a more general estimate of the mortality reduction from the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, see Borgschulte and Vogler, who estimated a decline of 3.6%. 12\nI don’t wish to make this section any longer, so I’ll say this: I’ve shown that insurance coverage matters, but the best evidence also strongly suggests that Senator Murphy cannot be right. The estimates based on providing free insurance, Medicaid expansions, IRS notifications, and other reforms suggest that increasing insurance has small-to-modest effects on mortality among at-risk populations, not that it has the gobsmackingly huge effects that Senator Murphy suggested it should among the whole population. And these are largely the effects of going from being uninsured to being insured, not from the more operative going from being insured with necessary care being denied to being insured with necessary care not being denied. Since going from being uninsured to being insured almost-certainly matters more than going from being poorly to less-poorly insured, and the effect of going from no insurance to some insurance (which mostly means public, not-for-profit insurance) is nowhere near enough. Being generous, Senator Murphy was probably off by more than an order of magnitude. There is simply no way to credibly argue for Senator Murphy’s claims.\n\nAre You OK?\nThere is simply no way Senator Murphy could honestly support his conclusion that thousands die every day due to medical care being denied to support profits. Let’s review.\nFor one, there aren’t that many people denied care, and no one directly dies due to an insurer denial because you can’t even be denied healthcare for an emergency at the point of care.\nFor two, even if you take confounded cross-sectional estimates of the impact of being uninsured —which has a much larger impact on healthcare utilization than being poorly insured—on mortality, it’s insufficient to explain anywhere near a large enough portion of all deaths.\nFor three, too few deaths happen among those with private insurance alone for his claims to be true.\nFor four, there aren’t enough deaths from medically preventable causes at the right ages for his claims to be true.\nFor N, we can go on! There are so many lines of evidence that Senator Murphy should have known that would have disconfirmed his claim, and yet there he was, making it before an audience of millions.\n\nPoliticians are infamously dishonest. A lot of that probably has to do with just being ignorant. Politicians usually aren’t exceptionally brilliant people, and there’s no end to the reporting on their dumb gaffes and mistakes. Given his statements, it’s clear that Senator Murphy is no exception, and he would have benefited from checking his numbers and having someone there to give him a sanity check before he opened his mouth. More generally, every politician should have this when it’s time to make empirical claims.\nBut being wrong about healthcare isn’t Senator Murphy’s worst sin. There’s a far more fundamental and pressing issue with Senator Murphy’s claims than just being wrong. His video’s entire purpose was to turn a senseless murder into a call for action against people whose harms he was actively exaggerating. His goal with the video was to vindicate violence by way of people feeling aggrieved over a problem that neither the killer nor he seem to understand.\nImagine if a sitting Senator who started their Congressional tenure in 2024 was killed in cold blood over an issue like U.S. military bases in Iraq. One could argue that people are disheartened and fed up with American military deployments and the Congressmen who contributed to them. By Senator Murphy’s standards, such a murder would be justified. To quote him: “People in America today feel ignored, they feel scared, they feel alone in a system that intentionally grinds them down. A system where profit matters more than life. My colleagues need to listen and we need to do something about it.”\nMy suggestion for Senator Murphy’s “something” is to be a little more sane, to get a lot more informed, and to be much less sensitive to the half-baked arguments of psychopaths who kill Americans in cold blood. Maybe then he can start to fix the healthcare system.\n1\n\nNotably, this applies to Medicare-participating hospitals and you cannot reasonably blame the healthcare system for the very small number of cases where people do not pursue critical care because they believe they won’t be able to pay for it. That’s not the fault of a system that won’t deny them the care they need.\n2\n\nIt’s also important to understand that recent increases in coverage since the passage of the ACA have been largely driven by increases in Medicaid coverage, often at the expense of better, private coverage.\n3\n\nThis study also found a potentially composition-driven effect of the ACA on Medicare-related suicide risks.\n4\n\nYou can also see this demographic disproportionality in coverage among individuals with cancer.\n5\n\nThe mortality rates for the completely uninsured are also relatively high, but they constitute a very small portion of total births.\n6\n\nYou could argue that some number of deaths are due to Medicaid enrollees’ coverage lapsing before or after pregnancy, but the impact of this would be small even if you maximized the possible number.\n7\n\nThey actually tend to have null or positive impacts, suggesting healthcare is overused.\n8\n\nAs noted in this study, the quasi-experimental literature (which they mistakenly called “quasi-empirical” in Footnote 1) produces split results on mortality benefits.\n9\n\nFor whatever it’s worth, the author of that paper did bring up another recent study, suggesting that cost sharing reduces drug usage, resulting in mixed and generally marginally significant effects on mortality. This isn’t relevant here, but it is relevant to the idea that drugs matter for survival in general.\n10\n\nWith a method that’s liable to leave a lot of residual confounding and with results that do not seem very robust. See the commentary on the article.\n11\n\nAlthough I’d caution that, though this makes theoretical sense to see risk rising with age, splitting the sample reduces power, and this is already a domain where power is very concerning.\n12\n\nThere is also, to my knowledge, just one sibling controlled estimate of the impact of Medicaid eligibility expansion, but it’s about childhood expansion impacts on adult outcomes, and it was dubious. The inclusion of the sibling control or family fixed effects turned results for impacts on cumulative total taxes at best marginally significant, but didn’t meaningfully affect their magnitude. It’s unclear how to interpret this given the statistical uncertainty.",

Then count out homicides, and it&#8217;s probably fair to just count out suicides too, since insurance denial is not really a documented correlate of suicide and the age groups with lots of suicides usually have fine coverage, but also for another reason I&#8217;ll get to in a moment. With all that out, we&#8217;re down to 625,979 deaths.</p><p>The next issue is that lots of young Americans are insured by another government insurance plan, Medicaid.</p><div

It is necessarily selective about who gets enrolled, leading to confounded estimates of the cross-sectional mortality delta associated with Medicaid versus private insurance. But this isn&#8217;t relevant for our purposes, because we just want to know how much of the under-65 death we can be cross-sectionally attributed to private insurance plans, and for that, all we need to know is the mortality delta associated with Medicaid, confounded or otherwise.</p><p>Interpreting mortality under age 65 as being due to profit-driven denial of care was already hard to do, but with Medicaid and the high mortality of Medicaid enrollees noted, it should be <em>very </em>hard to do. To make this clearer, let&#8217;s look at the mortality for people under one year of age.</p><p>The top causes of death for &lt;1-year-olds are largely things that happen around birth, like deaths from short gestation or intrauterine hypoxia, not really things that can be attributed to insurance denials, since care is already being provided at that point and it won&#8217;t be stopped and it&#8217;s obviously unlikely that a parent would call for it to be stopped regardless of cost. <a href=\"https://archive.md/SNopn\">About 41% of all births in the U.S. happen to mothers with Medicaid coverage</a>, and as noted above, their infant mortality rates are considerably higher than the rates for insured mothers.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-5\" href=\"#footnote-5\" target=\"_self\">5</a> If we say that 41% * 1.15 = 47.2% of these deaths are Medicaid deaths and we keep the rest as private insurance deaths, then the plausibly profit-driven share of deaths declines by a few thousand, but if we were being maximally realistic, it should probably still go down even more.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-6\" href=\"#footnote-6\" target=\"_self\">6</a></p><p>A lot of the deaths for people under one year of age are not preventable by the healthcare system. A denial shouldn&#8217;t matter for SIDS, sepsis, a neonatal hemorrhage, atelectasis, hydrops fetalis, delivery complications, and so on. Frankly, a lot of these need to be removed given the coverage mix (about half) and the feasibility of the system intervening for these conditions (the overwhelming majority of the remaining half!), but let&#8217;s be <em>exceedingly</em> generous to Senator Murphy&#8217;s position and just cut out half<em>, </em>and, at that, only half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, excluding what we&#8217;ve already parceled out. That reduces the death count from 625,979 to 618,999.</p><p>We then need to apply this logic to deaths from ages 1-64 too, because after all, how exactly is the healthcare system supposed to intervene on, say, diabetes, in a way it doesn&#8217;t already? And given the low socioeconomic status and thus high probability of Medicaid coverage for those who die below 65 years of age from causes like diabetes and heart disease, how can we chalk this up to the profit motive of insurers? I&#8217;m almost-certainly being <em>extremely </em>generous to Senator Murphy&#8217;s position by <em>only </em>counting out half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, and doing that brings us down to&#8230; 369,635 deaths.</p><p>And we&#8217;re not done scaling this down. We still ought to scale this down to account for medical care received by the small portion of people who are uninsured, who are not suffering through care denials <em>at the hands of insurers</em>. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK221653/\">The uninsured use care at lower rates than people with insurance</a>, but their usage rates are far from zero. If we were to say, flatly and generously, that the uninsured use medical care at 25% of the rate of the insured ignoring that they would use critical care at more comparable rates, then we would cut deaths below age 19 by 5.8% * 0.25 and between 19 and 64 by 10.9% * 0.25, bringing us down to less than half what Senator Murphy proposed, and we&#8217;re not even done whittling down that number!</p><p>But I suggest we don&#8217;t go further than this. We haven&#8217;t exhausted the sources of public insurance coverage (cut another ~8%-12% from the initial number to cut from depending on how you treat Tricare), and we&#8217;ve been excessively generous with how treatable we&#8217;ve considered different causes of death, and it is already impossible to achieve Senator Murphy&#8217;s stated numbers. It is impossible to even support 1,000 profit-driven denial-based deaths per day! After all is said and done, even the estimate I&#8217;ve produced is <em>still</em> a major overestimate, but going further merely adds insult to injury.</p><p>So how might we figure out a good estimate?</p><div><hr></div><h3><em>A Message From My Sponsor</em></h3><p>Steve Jobs is quoted as saying, &#8220;Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

Benefits</h3><p>If we take Senator Murphy&#8217;s implied numbers seriously, then almost all non-homicide, accident, or suicide deaths for the young should be attributable to care denials and, accordingly, we should see an almost total elimination of mortality when nonelderly people obtain reliable access to medical care. The implied effect Senator Murphy stated would see doctor strikes having a near-genocidal impact<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-7\" href=\"#footnote-7\" target=\"_self\">7</a>, it means Medicaid expansions should be majorly life-extending for the population, and when people gain access to care in other ways, practically any study should be able to show us huge benefits to mortality.</p><p>Let&#8217;s open up our handy-dandy copy of Joseph Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group&#8217;s <em>Free for All</em>?, turn it to page 211, and notice that in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment the book documents&#8212;in which people were given free health insurance&#8212;there was no effect whatsoever on overall mortality. There were two marginally-significant effects for &#8220;all elevated-risk persons&#8221; (<em>p</em> = 0.03) and for &#8220;elevated-risk and low-income persons&#8221; (<em>p</em> = 0.049), but if we believe these are real, they&#8217;re still <em>far </em>too small to justify Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims, and it&#8217;s not clear these findings would hold since the mortality benefits were <em>apparently </em>driven by blood pressure control and modern health plans cover blood pressure medication very well. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ajh/article-abstract/20/4/348/141573\">In fact, private plans cover it as well as Medicare and Medicaid</a>.</p><p>Newhouse also evaluated another free insurance experiment, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which people became able to receive Medicaid via a lottery. Whereas Senator Murphy predicts a <em>huge </em>effect on mortality immediately because denied care is critical to living, the reality of the experiment was that <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\">there was no effect on mortality (</a><em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\">p</a></em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/127/3/1057/1923446\"> = 0.638) at one year in</a>.

This was marginally significant with a huge sample size, so it&#8217;s a result that&#8217;s more likely under the null. When I pointed this out to the author, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">he responded by restating the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">p</a></em><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/highlights-from-the-comments-on-hanson\">-value</a> as if that somehow made the result more believable. I am not sure why this would impress anyone, but I know saying a <em>p-</em>value twice <em>does </em>impress some people, so I can&#8217;t discount the strategy.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-9\" href=\"#footnote-9\" target=\"_self\">9</a> A further problem with this is that this result is just for individuals aged 45-64 and we&#8217;re never presented with the results for individuals who are younger, but we are presented with estimated impacts on coverage, and we know those ages got covered less (but still a significant, positive amount) in response to IRS letters. We don&#8217;t know if it was statistically appropriate to split the sample by age because the authors provided insufficient documentation of their results, unless I missed something in a table somewhere. In any case, this stated result is in a higher-mortality age bracket than the bracket &lt;65-years-old which we&#8217;re interested in for evaluating Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims. For the rest of that bracket, below 45-64, this study found &#8220;no evidence that the intervention reduced mortality&#8230; over our sample period.&#8221;</p><p>There are other studies that have looked at the impacts of expanded coverage too. For example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/111/2/431/1938390\">Currie and Gruber</a> estimated that Medicaid eligibility expansion by 15.1pp between 1984 and 1992 reduced child mortality by 5.1%. <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1202099\">Sommers et al.</a> found that Medicaid expansions between 1997 and 2007 increased Medicaid coverage, decreased rates of being uninsured, decreased rates of delayed care, and led to significant reductions in all-cause mortality on the order of -6.1%. <a href=\"https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M13-2275\">A later paper by Sommers et al.</a> estimated<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-10\" href=\"#footnote-10\" target=\"_self\">10</a> that Massachusetts&#8217; 2006 healthcare reform that pushed the state to near-universal healthcare reduced all-cause mortality by 2.9% and drove down deaths from causes amenable to healthcare intervention by 4.5%.</p><p>The ACA allowed Medicaid to be expanded substantially starting in 2014, and since then, there have been several evaluations of the mortality benefits to expanded coverage. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/136/3/1783/6124639\">Miller, Johnson and Wherry</a> looked at ACA expansions across several states and focused in on the high-mortality population of people aged 55 to 64, finding a 7.0% reduction in year 0 and an 11.9% reduction by year 3 post-expansion. In aggregate, they documented an 8.1% reduction in morality relative to an estimated counterfactual mortality rate. The reductions in mortality for those aged 53-58 and aged 65 and older were nonsignificant.

The estimates based on providing free insurance, Medicaid expansions, IRS notifications, and other reforms suggest that increasing insurance has small-to-modest effects on mortality <em>among at-risk populations</em>, not that it has the gobsmackingly huge effects that Senator Murphy suggested it should <em>among the whole population</em>. And these are largely the effects of going from being <em>uninsured</em> to being <em>insured</em>, not from the more operative <em>going from being</em> <em>insured with necessary care being denied</em> to <em>being</em> <em>insured with necessary care not being denied</em>. Since going from being uninsured to being insured almost-certainly matters more than going from being poorly to less-poorly insured, and the effect of going from no insurance to some insurance (which mostly means public, not-for-profit insurance) is <em><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240727133340/https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-expansion-has-saved-at-least-19000-lives-new-research-finds\">nowhere near enough</a></em>. Being generous, Senator Murphy was probably off by more than an order of magnitude. There is simply no way to credibly argue for Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims.</p><div><hr></div><h3>Are You OK?</h3><p>There is simply no way Senator Murphy could honestly support his conclusion that thousands die every day due to medical care being denied to support profits. Let&#8217;s review.</p><p>For one, there aren&#8217;t that many people denied care, and no one directly dies due to an insurer denial because you can&#8217;t even be denied healthcare for an emergency at the point of care.</p><p>For two, even if you take <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20241216085326/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/\">confounded cross-sectional estimates</a> of the impact of being <em>uninsured</em>&#8212;which has a much larger impact on healthcare utilization than being poorly insured&#8212;on mortality, it&#8217;s insufficient to explain anywhere near a large enough portion of all deaths.</p><p>For three, too few deaths happen among those with private insurance alone for his claims to be true.</p><p>For four, there aren&#8217;t enough deaths from medically preventable causes at the right ages for his claims to be true.</p><p>For <em>N</em>, we can go on! There are so many lines of evidence that Senator Murphy should have known that would have disconfirmed his claim, and yet there he was, making it before an audience of millions.</p><div><hr></div><p>Politicians are infamously dishonest. A lot of that probably has to do with just being ignorant. Politicians usually aren&#8217;t exceptionally brilliant people, and there&#8217;s no end to the reporting on their dumb gaffes and mistakes. Given his statements, it&#8217;s clear that Senator Murphy is no exception, and he would have benefited from checking his numbers and having someone there to give him a sanity check before he opened his mouth. More generally, every politician should have this when it&#8217;s time to make empirical claims.</p><p>But being wrong about healthcare isn&#8217;t Senator Murphy&#8217;s worst sin. There&#8217;s a far more fundamental and pressing issue with Senator Murphy&#8217;s claims than just being wrong. His video&#8217;s entire purpose was to turn a senseless murder into a call for action against people whose harms he was actively exaggerating. His goal with  the video was to vindicate violence by way of people feeling aggrieved over a problem that <a href=\"https://www.cremieux.xyz/p/grading-the-worlds-shortest-manifesto\">neither the killer</a> nor he seem to understand.</p><p>Imagine if a sitting Senator who started their Congressional tenure in 2024 was killed in cold blood over an issue like <em>U.S. military bases in Iraq</em>. One could argue that people are disheartened and fed up with American military deployments and the Congressmen who contributed to them. By Senator Murphy&#8217;s standards, such a murder would be justified. To quote him: &#8220;People in America today feel ignored, they feel scared, they feel alone in a system that intentionally grinds them down. A system where profit matters more than life. My colleagues need to listen and we need to do something about it.&#8221;</p><p>My suggestion for Senator Murphy&#8217;s &#8220;something&#8221; is to be a little more sane, to get a lot more informed, and to be much less sensitive to the half-baked arguments of psychopaths who kill Americans in cold blood.

      "script_text": "This post is brought to you by my sponsor, Warp.\n\nConnecticut Senator Chris Murphy does not have even a basic understanding of American health statistics.\nOn December 15th in a video he posted to the social media platform X, he claimed that “thousands of people… die often anonymous deaths every single day in this country at the hands of a healthcare industry that mostly doesn’t give a shit about people and only cares about profits.” He noted that there were exceptions in the form of good people like “nurses, doctors” and he castigated a system that “pad[s] profits and make[s] money for the people who run the biggest companies”, likely referring to UnitedHealthcare and other large health insurers. Quote: “The business model of the healthcare industry is to deny care—necessary medical care to people who need it—and [to] force them into bankruptcy, or worse let them die, in order to grow a profit.”\nHe says he knows all this, and millions of Americans know it. But they do not “know this” and they cannot “know this” because it is not and cannot be true.\n\nIf you know the most basic healthcare statistics for the U.S.—like life expectancies, mortality numbers from different conditions and at different ages, denial rates and reasons and so on—then you realize that Senator Murphy’s is an impossible claim. But in case you don’t, I’ll explain why while being generous to his position and still taking him seriously given the power of his position and the duty holding that position puts on him to do his due diligence before addressing the American people as he did a few days ago.\nFirstly, Senator Murphy claims that “thousands of people” die “every single day” due to the denial of care. If we set “thousands” to the minimum it can be, then we get to 730,000 annual deaths due to the denial of care by a system that “only cares about profits”. He was being hyperbolic, but, two things: there are plenty of people who share his exactly-stated view—ignorance is common—, and he’s a Senator, someone who represents millions of Americans, so he should own the things he says. We ought to take him seriously because he is in one of the world’s most important positions.\nThe qualifier he provided, that denial deaths are driven by a system that “only cares about profits”, is critical, because it means that almost all deaths after age 65 do not count. When people turn 65, they qualify for Medicare. Medicare is the reason why virtually everyone over that age is covered. Not only that, but Medicare means that the elderly are covered by a system without a profit motive on the insurer’s part, since the insurer’s role in Medicare is filled by the government.\n\nImage: Infographic: Young Americans Most Likely to Lack Healthcare Coverage | Statista\n\n\n\nBuchholz 2019. Note that this is merely illustrative and more recent data show comparable or slightly higher aggregate insurance coverage rates.\nI am reasonably certain that Senator Murphy does not believe Medicare is a broken system that kills Americans with denials since the fee-for-service (FFS) variant minimally uses prior authorization and Advantage outperforms FFS while operating within strict constraints set by CMS. Senator Murphy is a champion of ‘Medicare-for-All’, so for consistency, we have to cut virtually all deaths over age 65 from the possible deaths that can be attributed to denials.\nIf we look through causes of death by age in 2022, then we see that cutting out even just the top-20 causes of death for those aged 65+ means losing 1,984,199 deaths out of 2022’s total of… 3,279,857. We’re losing just over 60% of the deaths and leaving ourselves with 1,295,658 to pull at least 730,000 from, and that’s not even counting out all of the deaths over age 65! But let’s be accurate and go all the way with removing deaths over age 65, bringing us down to 853,082 from which to pull 730,000.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nWISQARS\nNext we need to whittle down the remaining deaths, because many of them are clearly not plausibly driven by denials. For example, deaths due to unintentional injury and homicide are not being driven by denials because people cannot be denied emergency care thanks to EMTALA. 1 In 2022, unintentional injury was the leading cause of death for ages 1-44, it was #4 for individuals <1 years of age, and it was #3 for ages 45-64. Then count out homicides, and it’s probably fair to just count out suicides too, since insurance denial is not really a documented correlate of suicide and the age groups with lots of suicides usually have fine coverage, but also for another reason I’ll get to in a moment. With all that out, we’re down to 625,979 deaths.\nThe next issue is that lots of young Americans are insured by another government insurance plan, Medicaid.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\nLink\nThis cuts against the profit driven denial-induced mortality explanation offered by Senator Murphy. 2 This also makes it harder to interpret the remaining deaths because they disproportionately affect those enrolled in Medicaid. For example, relative to those with private insurance, people with Medicaid are more suicidal. 3 People on Medicaid also have much higher infant mortality rates than people with private insurance do, they have higher mortality in very diverse settings, and their mortality rates are, in general, higher. Medicaid also enrolls disproportionately many people with disabilities, and wherever you look, disability is associated with mortality. Medicaid is also disproportionately used by American Indians and Blacks, whose nonelderly mortality rates are much higher than the rates for Whites at the same ages. 4\nIt’s unlikely that the greater mortality seen among Medicaid enrollees just reflects the quality of care they receive, because it is a program for low-income persons. It is necessarily selective about who gets enrolled, leading to confounded estimates of the cross-sectional mortality delta associated with Medicaid versus private insurance. But this isn’t relevant for our purposes, because we just want to know how much of the under-65 death we can be cross-sectionally attributed to private insurance plans, and for that, all we need to know is the mortality delta associated with Medicaid, confounded or otherwise.\nInterpreting mortality under age 65 as being due to profit-driven denial of care was already hard to do, but with Medicaid and the high mortality of Medicaid enrollees noted, it should be very hard to do. To make this clearer, let’s look at the mortality for people under one year of age.\nThe top causes of death for <1-year-olds are largely things that happen around birth, like deaths from short gestation or intrauterine hypoxia, not really things that can be attributed to insurance denials, since care is already being provided at that point and it won’t be stopped and it’s obviously unlikely that a parent would call for it to be stopped regardless of cost. About 41% of all births in the U.S. happen to mothers with Medicaid coverage, and as noted above, their infant mortality rates are considerably higher than the rates for insured mothers. 5 If we say that 41% * 1.15 = 47.2% of these deaths are Medicaid deaths and we keep the rest as private insurance deaths, then the plausibly profit-driven share of deaths declines by a few thousand, but if we were being maximally realistic, it should probably still go down even more. 6\nA lot of the deaths for people under one year of age are not preventable by the healthcare system. A denial shouldn’t matter for SIDS, sepsis, a neonatal hemorrhage, atelectasis, hydrops fetalis, delivery complications, and so on. Frankly, a lot of these need to be removed given the coverage mix (about half) and the feasibility of the system intervening for these conditions (the overwhelming majority of the remaining half!), but let’s be exceedingly generous to Senator Murphy’s position and just cut out half, and, at that, only half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, excluding what we’ve already parceled out. That reduces the death count from 625,979 to 618,999.\nWe then need to apply this logic to deaths from ages 1-64 too, because after all, how exactly is the healthcare system supposed to intervene on, say, diabetes, in a way it doesn’t already? And given the low socioeconomic status and thus high probability of Medicaid coverage for those who die below 65 years of age from causes like diabetes and heart disease, how can we chalk this up to the profit motive of insurers? I’m almost-certainly being extremely generous to Senator Murphy’s position by only counting out half of the deaths from the top-20 causes of death, and doing that brings us down to… 369,635 deaths.\nAnd we’re not done scaling this down. We still ought to scale this down to account for medical care received by the small portion of people who are uninsured, who are not suffering through care denials at the hands of insurers. The uninsured use care at lower rates than people with insurance, but their usage rates are far from zero. If we were to say, flatly and generously, that the uninsured use medical care at 25% of the rate of the insured ignoring that they would use critical care at more comparable rates, then we would cut deaths below age 19 by 5.8% * 0.25 and between 19 and 64 by 10.9% * 0.25, bringing us down to less than half what Senator Murphy proposed, and we’re not even done whittling down that number!\nBut I suggest we don’t go further than this. We haven’t exhausted the sources of public insurance coverage (cut another ~8%-12% from the initial number to cut from depending on how you treat Tricare), and we’ve been excessively generous with how treatable we’ve considered different causes of death, and it is already impossible to achieve Senator Murphy’s stated numbers. It is impossible to even support 1,000 profit-driven denial-based deaths per day! After all is said and done, even the estimate I’ve produced is still a major overestimate, but going further merely adds insult to injury.\nSo how might we figure out a good estimate?\n\nA Message From My Sponsor\nSteve Jobs is quoted as saying, “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” Few B2B SaaS companies take this as seriously as Warp, the payroll and compliance platform used by based founders and startups.\nWarp has cut out all the features you don’t need (looking at you, Gusto’s “e-Welcome” card for new employees) and has automated the ones you do: federal, state, and local tax compliance, global contractor payments, and 5-minute onboarding.\nIn other words, Warp saves you enough time that you’ll stop having the intrusive thoughts suggesting you might actually need to make your first Human Resources hire.\nGet started now at joinwarp.com/crem and get a $1,000 Amazon gift card when you run payroll for the first time.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nGet Started Now: www.joinwarp.com/crem\n\nFree Insurance, Limited Benefits\nIf we take Senator Murphy’s implied numbers seriously, then almost all non-homicide, accident, or suicide deaths for the young should be attributable to care denials and, accordingly, we should see an almost total elimination of mortality when nonelderly people obtain reliable access to medical care. The implied effect Senator Murphy stated would see doctor strikes having a near-genocidal impact 7, it means Medicaid expansions should be majorly life-extending for the population, and when people gain access to care in other ways, practically any study should be able to show us huge benefits to mortality.\nLet’s open up our handy-dandy copy of Joseph Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group’s Free for All?, turn it to page 211, and notice that in the RAND Health Insurance Experiment the book documents—in which people were given free health insurance—there was no effect whatsoever on overall mortality. There were two marginally-significant effects for “all elevated-risk persons” ( p= 0.03) and for “elevated-risk and low-income persons” ( p= 0.049), but if we believe these are real, they’re still far too small to justify Senator Murphy’s claims, and it’s not clear these findings would hold since the mortality benefits were apparently driven by blood pressure control and modern health plans cover blood pressure medication very well. In fact, private plans cover it as well as Medicare and Medicaid.\nNewhouse also evaluated another free insurance experiment, the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment, in which people became able to receive Medicaid via a lottery. Whereas Senator Murphy predicts a huge effect on mortality immediately because denied care is critical to living, the reality of the experiment was that there was no effect on mortality ( p= 0.638) at one year in. At two years, mortality didn’t even get a mention.\nA deeper issue with this approach is suggested by the evidence that giving out free hospital insurance in the very poor setting of India didn’t impact mortality ( p= 0.838) at 3.5 years post-intervention. 8 If gaining access to hospital care doesn’t even materially affect mortality in a setting with extremely limited utilization of care—both before and after receiving free insurance!—, effects in America should be considered more doubtful. But not too much more doubtful, since the Indian study participants seem to have been affected by a lack of awareness of how insurance works.\nIf we look at a more optimistic estimate based on IRS notifications to get insured, we get a 0.06pp reduction in mortality among those aged 45-64 years of age who received a letter. This was marginally significant with a huge sample size, so it’s a result that’s more likely under the null. When I pointed this out to the author, he responded by restating the p-value as if that somehow made the result more believable. I am not sure why this would impress anyone, but I know saying a p- value twice does impress some people, so I can’t discount the strategy. 9 A further problem with this is that this result is just for individuals aged 45-64 and we’re never presented with the results for individuals who are younger, but we are presented with estimated impacts on coverage, and we know those ages got covered less (but still a significant, positive amount) in response to IRS letters. We don’t know if it was statistically appropriate to split the sample by age because the authors provided insufficient documentation of their results, unless I missed something in a table somewhere. In any case, this stated result is in a higher-mortality age bracket than the bracket <65-years-old which we’re interested in for evaluating Senator Murphy’s claims. For the rest of that bracket, below 45-64, this study found “no evidence that the intervention reduced mortality… over our sample period.”\nThere are other studies that have looked at the impacts of expanded coverage too. For example, Currie and Gruber estimated that Medicaid eligibility expansion by 15.1pp between 1984 and 1992 reduced child mortality by 5.1%. Sommers et al. found that Medicaid expansions between 1997 and 2007 increased Medicaid coverage, decreased rates of being uninsured, decreased rates of delayed care, and led to significant reductions in all-cause mortality on the order of -6.1%. A later paper by Sommers et al. estimated 10 that Massachusetts’ 2006 healthcare reform that pushed the state to near-universal healthcare reduced all-cause mortality by 2.9% and drove down deaths from causes amenable to healthcare intervention by 4.5%.\nThe ACA allowed Medicaid to be expanded substantially starting in 2014, and since then, there have been several evaluations of the mortality benefits to expanded coverage. Miller, Johnson and Wherry looked at ACA expansions across several states and focused in on the high-mortality population of people aged 55 to 64, finding a 7.0% reduction in year 0 and an 11.9% reduction by year 3 post-expansion. In aggregate, they documented an 8.1% reduction in morality relative to an estimated counterfactual mortality rate. The reductions in mortality for those aged 53-58 and aged 65 and older were nonsignificant. The reductions really set in only for those aged 59-64: old, but pre-Medicare. 11 For a more general estimate of the mortality reduction from the ACA’s Medicaid expansions, see Borgschulte and Vogler, who estimated a decline of 3.6%. 12\nI don’t wish to make this section any longer, so I’ll say this: I’ve shown that insurance coverage matters, but the best evidence also strongly suggests that Senator Murphy cannot be right. The estimates based on providing free insurance, Medicaid expansions, IRS notifications, and other reforms suggest that increasing insurance has small-to-modest effects on mortality among at-risk populations, not that it has the gobsmackingly huge effects that Senator Murphy suggested it should among the whole population. And these are largely the effects of going from being uninsured to being insured, not from the more operative going from being insured with necessary care being denied to being insured with necessary care not being denied. Since going from being uninsured to being insured almost-certainly matters more than going from being poorly to less-poorly insured, and the effect of going from no insurance to some insurance (which mostly means public, not-for-profit insurance) is nowhere near enough. Being generous, Senator Murphy was probably off by more than an order of magnitude. There is simply no way to credibly argue for Senator Murphy’s claims.\n\nAre You OK?\nThere is simply no way Senator Murphy could honestly support his conclusion that thousands die every day due to medical care being denied to support profits. Let’s review.\nFor one, there aren’t that many people denied care, and no one directly dies due to an insurer denial because you can’t even be denied healthcare for an emergency at the point of care.\nFor two, even if you take confounded cross-sectional estimates of the impact of being uninsured —which has a much larger impact on healthcare utilization than being poorly insured—on mortality, it’s insufficient to explain anywhere near a large enough portion of all deaths.\nFor three, too few deaths happen among those with private insurance alone for his claims to be true.\nFor four, there aren’t enough deaths from medically preventable causes at the right ages for his claims to be true.\nFor N, we can go on! There are so many lines of evidence that Senator Murphy should have known that would have disconfirmed his claim, and yet there he was, making it before an audience of millions.\n\nPoliticians are infamously dishonest. A lot of that probably has to do with just being ignorant. Politicians usually aren’t exceptionally brilliant people, and there’s no end to the reporting on their dumb gaffes and mistakes. Given his statements, it’s clear that Senator Murphy is no exception, and he would have benefited from checking his numbers and having someone there to give him a sanity check before he opened his mouth. More generally, every politician should have this when it’s time to make empirical claims.\nBut being wrong about healthcare isn’t Senator Murphy’s worst sin. There’s a far more fundamental and pressing issue with Senator Murphy’s claims than just being wrong. His video’s entire purpose was to turn a senseless murder into a call for action against people whose harms he was actively exaggerating. His goal with the video was to vindicate violence by way of people feeling aggrieved over a problem that neither the killer nor he seem to understand.\nImagine if a sitting Senator who started their Congressional tenure in 2024 was killed in cold blood over an issue like U.S. military bases in Iraq. One could argue that people are disheartened and fed up with American military deployments and the Congressmen who contributed to them. By Senator Murphy’s standards, such a murder would be justified. To quote him: “People in America today feel ignored, they feel scared, they feel alone in a system that intentionally grinds them down. A system where profit matters more than life. My colleagues need to listen and we need to do something about it.”\nMy suggestion for Senator Murphy’s “something” is to be a little more sane, to get a lot more informed, and to be much less sensitive to the half-baked arguments of psychopaths who kill Americans in cold blood. Maybe then he can start to fix the healthcare system.\n1\n\nNotably, this applies to Medicare-participating hospitals and you cannot reasonably blame the healthcare system for the very small number of cases where people do not pursue critical care because they believe they won’t be able to pay for it. That’s not the fault of a system that won’t deny them the care they need.\n2\n\nIt’s also important to understand that recent increases in coverage since the passage of the ACA have been largely driven by increases in Medicaid coverage, often at the expense of better, private coverage.\n3\n\nThis study also found a potentially composition-driven effect of the ACA on Medicare-related suicide risks.\n4\n\nYou can also see this demographic disproportionality in coverage among individuals with cancer.\n5\n\nThe mortality rates for the completely uninsured are also relatively high, but they constitute a very small portion of total births.\n6\n\nYou could argue that some number of deaths are due to Medicaid enrollees’ coverage lapsing before or after pregnancy, but the impact of this would be small even if you maximized the possible number.\n7\n\nThey actually tend to have null or positive impacts, suggesting healthcare is overused.\n8\n\nAs noted in this study, the quasi-experimental literature (which they mistakenly called “quasi-empirical” in Footnote 1) produces split results on mortality benefits.\n9\n\nFor whatever it’s worth, the author of that paper did bring up another recent study, suggesting that cost sharing reduces drug usage, resulting in mixed and generally marginally significant effects on mortality. This isn’t relevant here, but it is relevant to the idea that drugs matter for survival in general.\n10\n\nWith a method that’s liable to leave a lot of residual confounding and with results that do not seem very robust. See the commentary on the article.\n11\n\nAlthough I’d caution that, though this makes theoretical sense to see risk rising with age, splitting the sample reduces power, and this is already a domain where power is very concerning.\n12\n\nThere is also, to my knowledge, just one sibling controlled estimate of the impact of Medicaid eligibility expansion, but it’s about childhood expansion impacts on adult outcomes, and it was dubious. The inclusion of the sibling control or family fixed effects turned results for impacts on cumulative total taxes at best marginally significant, but didn’t meaningfully affect their magnitude. It’s unclear how to interpret this given the statistical uncertainty.",

It&#8217;s peaceful there. Horses run free by the lake. A moment to reflect on what it means to be the last thinking people on an island of the infected and the dead. &#8216;You&#8217;ll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You&#8217;ll never read a book that hasn&#8217;t already been written. Or see a film that hasn&#8217;t already been shot.&#8217; This is a useful line, because it gives us a new framing for a familiar problem, even if </em>28 Days Later<em>, which came out in 2002, is older than the phenomenon it&#8217;s describing. It says that what we&#8217;ve been living through for roughly the past two decades is not &#8216;stuck culture&#8217; or &#8216;sequel bloat.&#8217; We have been living through the </em>zombie apocalypse<em>.  </em></p><p><em>Two years ago, I wrote that <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/all-the-nerds-are-dead\">all the nerds were dead</a>. The nerd era in culture was a response to the problem of data saturation: we were producing too much recorded culture for anyone to be able to sort through it all. In the fifteenth century, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola claimed to have read every single published text in general circulation, which back then amounted to maybe a gigabyte of data. We currently produce that much information every thirty milliseconds. The first cultural response to this problem was the hipster, which was the consumer as information-sorting algorithm. &#8216;The hipster listened to bands you&#8217;d never heard of. The hipster drank beers brewed by Paraguayan Jesuits in the 1750s. The hipster thought Tarkovsky was for posers, and the only truly great late-Soviet filmmaker was Ali Khamraev.&#8217; The hipster was also deeply annoying. Once we developed efficient digital sorting algorithms, the hipster became obsolete, and the cultural hegemony of the nerd began. </em></p><p><em>In the nerd era, abstract equations served you up a constant stream of targeted slurry, and your job was to be unreasonably enthusiastic about it. Nerds are people who like things simply because they exist, and the nerd era was the era of the massive repetitive franchises: Marvel, Taylor Swift. For anyone to maintain individual taste and not enjoy this dreck was, for the nerds, a kind of affront. The nerd era felt like it would go on forever, but it&#8217;s now very definitively over. What&#8217;s strange is that, as I wrote at the start of the year, seemingly nothing in mass culture has arrived to replace it. Instead, we&#8217;re reduced to dredging up the last remnants of the hipster era to squeeze out any remaining nostalgia-value, in what I&#8217;ve called the <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2025\">necrosequel</a>. &#8216;</em>Gladiator II<em> came out twenty-four years after </em>Gladiator<em>. </em>Twisters<em> came out twenty-eight years after </em>Twister<em>. </em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice<em> arrived thirty-six years after the first instalment.&#8217; This month, Pulp released their first album in a quarter of a century. Why? Not clear. It&#8217;s not like they have a radical new sound they need to share with the world. They&#8217;re doing what they always did, just not as well. The album is called </em>More<em>. And now, we have </em>28 Years Later<em>.</em></p><p><em>To be fair, </em>28 Years<em> is not an ordinary necrosequel. It doesn&#8217;t just repeat the exact storyline from the original; our hero is not supposed to be Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris&#8217;s child. The story begins on Lindisfarne, which a small community of survivors has fortified against the zombies that roam freely over the mainland. The villagers keep sheep and brew their own beer. They keep a cross of St George flying, and put up a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II back when she was young and the British Empire still governed a quarter of the globe. Out to sea, NATO vessels enforce their quarantine against this island of the dead, but for once, Boyle chooses not to deliver the obligatory zombie-film message, that humans are the real monsters. The village is a cosy, tight-knit, high-trust community. Later, on the mainland, we meet Erik, a Swedish soldier whose boat sank while enforcing the blockade on Britain. Erik talks about app delivery services. He shows our heroes a picture of his extremely bogged girlfriend on his phone. They&#8217;ve never seen a phone before. They think her lip fillers are an allergic reaction. It&#8217;s comic relief, but the joke&#8217;s on the techno-cosmopolitan Swede, not the ignorant Brexiteers. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to have not bothered with the twenty-first century? Go back to the simple life. No phones, no online bullshit, no foreigners. The village, incidentally, is uniformly white; the only non-white people in the film are among the infected. Meanwhile Boyle shoots everything in a kind of nostalgic parody of his own style, reviving all his Danny Boylest techniques from three decades ago, equal parts gore and schmaltz. Zombie apocalypse is no longer the end of the world and the destruction of the past: the zombies are now what </em>preserve<em> the past against the forces of social change.</em></p><p><em>But the choice the film is setting up here, between the world of the phone and the nostalgic community on Lindisfarne, is obviously a false one. The reason we&#8217;re stuck repeating the past, the reason we&#8217;re even watching this necrosequel about necrosequels, is the informational regime brought about by the phone. This is why we have our backwards peasant mass culture. It&#8217;s also why we have the zombies. </em></p><p><em>The third stage of culture in the zettabyte age, after the hipster and the nerd, is the zombie. If the hipster represents cultural taste as sorting algorithm, and the nerd represents cultural taste determined by sorting algorithm, the zombie is the point at which we stop consuming culture-commodities altogether and start directly consuming the sorting algorithm itself.</em></p><p><em>According to some middle-aged critics, our current age is the age of short-form, attention-grabbing, dopamine-boosting content. TikToks, essentially. But the individual TikTok is actually a fairly conservative and old-fashioned object: a short film, scripted and choreographed ahead of time, and then exhaustively edited afterwards. It might last seconds rather than hours, but the TikToker is still doing essentially the same </em>kind<em> of thing as, say, Fritz Lang. But most people don&#8217;t actually watch TikToks. Next time you&#8217;re next to someone doomscrolling through short-form video, watch what they actually do. Most of the time, they never actually watch a single twenty-second video through to the end. Flick down, vaguely register the general content of the video, immediately flick down again. Flick, flick, flick, for hours at a time, consuming literally nothing. Or, rather, consuming nothing except the </em>algorithm<em>, the pure flow and speed of the machine that gathers the entire world together and beams it directly at your face.</em></p><p><em>It&#8217;s not a question of attention spans: in the zombie era, people will engage with media in whatever way allows them direct access to that pure flow. If the medium is short-form video, they&#8217;ll scroll through it rapidly. But TikTok also features a streaming service called TikTok live, which mostly consists of women very slowly applying their makeup, or pretending to eat emoji of hamburgers, or pretending to be video game NPCs, or just wandering around, pointing out entirely ordinary objects like paving stones and bushes and other people&#8217;s cars in a slow xanned up purr&#8212;and people will watch these streams for hours on end. The real epicentre of contemporary youth culture isn&#8217;t TikTok, which is an app for cringe balding zoomers, but Twitch. This is where all the slang comes from, and it&#8217;ll be the breeding-ground for all the minor celebrities of the next few decades. Streaming has largely replaced music as the engine for new subcultures. In the same way that Instagram and YouTube (and, most recently, Substack) have been pathetically bolting TikTok clones to their services, TikTok is now desperately trying not to sink in the age of Twitch. The reason Hollywood is still stuck in the post-franchise holding pattern is that all forms of linear narrative entertainment are essentially obsolete. (A friend of mine has never sat through a single episode of the </em>Sopranos<em>, but he&#8217;s watched pretty much the entire show through nonlinear YouTube clips; he knows how every major character dies, just not in what order.) Those of us who are still stuck in these ancient media perceive a world in cultural stasis. But the zombies know better.</em></p><p><em>It takes genuinely impressive powers of engagement to be able to watch a Twitch stream. Because I take my journalism seriously I really tried to do it, but found it impossible; I kept getting distracted and picking up a book instead. These things are all eight hours long and, for someone raised on narrative media, impossibly boring. The most basic form of Twitch stream consists of watching someone else play video games, which previous generations of children could only tolerate for about three minutes before trying to grab the controller out their friend&#8217;s hands. My turn, my turn! But the zombie never expects a turn. The object of consumption isn&#8217;t the game, mediated through the streamer, but the act of streaming itself. Most streamers are reasonably good at the games they play, but this only matters in as much as it prevents any kind of friction. Many keep up a constant babble throughout, which is also unimportant. The second-most followed streamer on the platform is someone called Kai Cenat. Here&#8217;s what he says roughly midway through his most recent two-and-a-half-hour &#8216;short&#8217; stream: &#8216;On God you guys have grown, in ways, unimaginable. Deadass. Now! Can&#8217;t even. You know what? I can&#8217;t even. I need to see, I&#8217;ma give y&#8217;all, I&#8217;ma give y&#8217;all thirty seconds to give me the best compliments. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight. Twenty-seven. Twenty-six.&#8217; He continues to count backwards all the way from thirty, with the mysterious omission of the number twenty-three, before reading out all the compliments his audience have posted for him. I tried another one. &#8216;Bro my fucking shit is fucked,&#8217; he says. Someone else wanders into shot, visibly grumpy, and asks what they&#8217;re even doing. &#8216;I want some ice cream,&#8217; says Kai Cenat. &#8216;You know what I&#8217;m saying, I want some ice cream man.&#8217; </em></p><p><em>The </em>most<em> popular streamer is a man called Tyler Blevins, who goes by Ninja. Blevins is apparently extremely good at playing Fortnite, but despite having blue highlights in his hair he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. On his streams he can go for a while without saying a single word, and when he does manage to eject some brief sentiment you get the sense he didn&#8217;t really need to bother. I thought I might have caught him on a bad day so I tried watching his highlights, but it&#8217;s all like this. He exclusively says things like &#8216;This dual hammer meta is absolutely disgusting and I really hope they patch them immediately and make them share global cooldown.&#8217; His audience would be just as happy watching a trained pigeon peck at levers. </em></p><p><em>Of course, not all streamers only post gaming content. You can watch someone buy and open football cards! You can watch someone pick his nose! A surprising number of people, including Kai Cenat, don&#8217;t just stream every waking moment; they also stream themselves sleeping at night. An even more surprising number of people watch them. But maybe the most magnificently pointless are the political streamers: instead of watching someone else play video games, you get to watch someone else go on Twitter. Occasionally, the political streamers will get in a feud with one another. Whatever ideological struggles these people and their followers think they&#8217;re engaged in, the real purpose of the Twitch fight is very different. It exists to create a situation in which you&#8217;re watching a stream of someone else watching a stream. The circuit is complete. </em></p><p><em>Zombification is most noticeable online, but it&#8217;s happening in every medium. When </em>28 Days Later<em> was released in 2002, the emerging form in black British music was grime; today it&#8217;s drill. The difference is striking. Grime was a very specifically British genre: unlike most forms of global rap, it wasn&#8217;t an American import but had developed indigenously through UK garage and jungle. Early grime instrumentals were homemade and haphazard; from the </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3rWH9pWkVQ\">Eskimo </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3rWH9pWkVQ\">riddim</a> on they tended to feature a lot of endearingly naff synths. A bunch of kids playing around with Korg Tritons in council estate bedrooms all over London. Many grime MCs had voices that were straightforwardly weird, which they deployed on high-concept tracks with elastic, constantly shifting <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8hi7CaqE8A\">internal rhythmic variations</a>. Grime could be deadly serious, a chronicle of a fairly bleak existence in the crevices of Tony Blair&#8217;s Britain, but it could also be fun or sexy or experimental or absurd. It even started <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=FJ_tdehZHuk\">crossbreeding</a> with the simultaneous indie rock revival happening in whiter, leafier corners of the country. For anyone who grew up in the hipster age, when grime was flourishing, drill music feels like an obviously inferior product. It is not even remotely fun. It has no personality and no erotic depth. The flow on every bar in every drill track is exactly the same, hitting the exact same 16th-note subdivisions: dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-DA. Drill rappers generally refuse any kind of artistic individuality. The standard outfit is a North Face puffer and a ski mask. The music is a Chicago invention, but it&#8217;s universal now: in every major city in Europe, street music means people wearing the exact same anonymising clothes and rapping in the exact same rhythm to basically interchangeable beats. An almost military uniformity. </em></p><p><em>My favourite example is a drill rapper called TS, real name Al-Arfat Hassan, whose bars are mostly about the <a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=zwcXAXkJV-A\">gruesome violence</a> he wants to inflict on all non-Muslims. &#8216;Soldier of Allah, not sad if I bleed/ Insha Allah I&#8217;ll die a shahid.&#8217; At one point he says that if you consort with djinn he&#8217;ll take out your brain, cook it in a frying pan, and eat it. In 2024 TS was jailed for trying to build a bomb from an ISIS training video. But before he was convicted and his videos deleted from YouTube, the comments on them were uniformly positive, most of them from non-Muslims. None of these people had </em>noticed<em> what he was actually saying; they weren&#8217;t consuming his tracks as individual works, but as an embodiment of the form. The actual idiosyncrasy of the ISIS-supporting rapper failed to register. When people make and listen to drill, what they&#8217;re engaging with is not quite what we understand as </em>music<em>. It has the same relation to the 40,000-year-old musical tradition, from the first palaeolithic bone flutes to early twentieth-century grime, that Twitch streaming has to Sophocles. </em></p><p><em>The pinnacle of zombie culture, though, is obviously AI. Chatbots allow you to essentially skip even the pretence of cultural mediation and just interface directly with the sorting mechanism, which is exactly what generative AI really is: a device for sifting through the impossibly vast corpus of human information and finding patterns. The difference between ChatGPT and previous forms of zombie culture is that it&#8217;s totally opaque. Everyone&#8217;s individual For You Page on TikTok is notionally unique, but they&#8217;re all composed of the same stock of videos; meanwhile there is absolutely no way to find out what perverted things people are doing with AI unless one of three things happen. Either you peer at their phone on public transport, or they post screenshots on Reddit, or they kill themselves. Whenever this happens, it usually turns out that they have either been using the sorting algorithm as a therapist, using the sorting algorithm to divine the hidden secrets of the cosmos, or that they and the sorting algorithm have fallen in love. Their ideal of a healthy personal relationship is now modelled on the horrible little eunuch that lives inside their phones, and which can only ever flatter and ingratiate because at root it&#8217;s still fundamentally a machine for predicting which token you would want to appear next in a text string. It&#8217;s strange that everything is still here, cars still stop at red lights and kids still go to school, as if the world hasn&#8217;t changed, all while unknown millions of our fellow-citizens have essentially become mindless fleshy appendages to the machine.</em></p><p><em>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve read <a href=\"https://www.brainonllm.com/\">the study</a> that found dramatically reduced brain activity among people who use AI. But if I&#8217;m honest I&#8217;ve been thinking about their brains for a while.

Chat, I think I might have been washed. Someone washed me. Someone dried me. Someone tucked me up in bed. But chat, who washed me? Chat, who dried me? Chat, who tucked me up in bed?\n\n(Midway through Danny Boyle’s original 28 Days Later, our heroes escape London and pass through the ruins of Waverley Abbey, destroyed in 1536 during the dissolution of the monasteries. It’s peaceful there. Horses run free by the lake. A moment to reflect on what it means to be the last thinking people on an island of the infected and the dead. ‘You’ll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You’ll never read a book that hasn’t already been written. Or see a film that hasn’t already been shot.’ This is a useful line, because it gives us a new framing for a familiar problem, even if 28 Days Later, which came out in 2002, is older than the phenomenon it’s describing. It says that what we’ve been living through for roughly the past two decades is not ‘stuck culture’ or ‘sequel bloat.’ We have been living through the zombie apocalypse.\nTwo years ago, I wrote that all the nerds were dead. The nerd era in culture was a response to the problem of data saturation: we were producing too much recorded culture for anyone to be able to sort through it all. In the fifteenth century, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola claimed to have read every single published text in general circulation, which back then amounted to maybe a gigabyte of data. We currently produce that much information every thirty milliseconds. The first cultural response to this problem was the hipster, which was the consumer as information-sorting algorithm. ‘The hipster listened to bands you’d never heard of. The hipster drank beers brewed by Paraguayan Jesuits in the 1750s. The hipster thought Tarkovsky was for posers, and the only truly great late-Soviet filmmaker was Ali Khamraev.’ The hipster was also deeply annoying. Once we developed efficient digital sorting algorithms, the hipster became obsolete, and the cultural hegemony of the nerd began.\nIn the nerd era, abstract equations served you up a constant stream of targeted slurry, and your job was to be unreasonably enthusiastic about it. Nerds are people who like things simply because they exist, and the nerd era was the era of the massive repetitive franchises: Marvel, Taylor Swift. For anyone to maintain individual taste and not enjoy this dreck was, for the nerds, a kind of affront. The nerd era felt like it would go on forever, but it’s now very definitively over. What’s strange is that, as I wrote at the start of the year, seemingly nothing in mass culture has arrived to replace it. Instead, we’re reduced to dredging up the last remnants of the hipster era to squeeze out any remaining nostalgia-value, in what I’ve called the necrosequel. ‘ Gladiator II came out twenty-four years after Gladiator. Twisters came out twenty-eight years after Twister. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice arrived thirty-six years after the first instalment.’ This month, Pulp released their first album in a quarter of a century. Why? Not clear. It’s not like they have a radical new sound they need to share with the world. They’re doing what they always did, just not as well. The album is called More. And now, we have 28 Years Later.\nTo be fair, 28 Years is not an ordinary necrosequel. It doesn’t just repeat the exact storyline from the original; our hero is not supposed to be Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris’s child. The story begins on Lindisfarne, which a small community of survivors has fortified against the zombies that roam freely over the mainland. The villagers keep sheep and brew their own beer. They keep a cross of St George flying, and put up a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II back when she was young and the British Empire still governed a quarter of the globe. Out to sea, NATO vessels enforce their quarantine against this island of the dead, but for once, Boyle chooses not to deliver the obligatory zombie-film message, that humans are the real monsters. The village is a cosy, tight-knit, high-trust community. Later, on the mainland, we meet Erik, a Swedish soldier whose boat sank while enforcing the blockade on Britain. Erik talks about app delivery services. He shows our heroes a picture of his extremely bogged girlfriend on his phone. They’ve never seen a phone before. They think her lip fillers are an allergic reaction. It’s comic relief, but the joke’s on the techno-cosmopolitan Swede, not the ignorant Brexiteers. Wouldn’t it be nice to have not bothered with the twenty-first century? Go back to the simple life. No phones, no online bullshit, no foreigners. The village, incidentally, is uniformly white; the only non-white people in the film are among the infected. Meanwhile Boyle shoots everything in a kind of nostalgic parody of his own style, reviving all his Danny Boylest techniques from three decades ago, equal parts gore and schmaltz. Zombie apocalypse is no longer the end of the world and the destruction of the past: the zombies are now what preserve the past against the forces of social change.\nBut the choice the film is setting up here, between the world of the phone and the nostalgic community on Lindisfarne, is obviously a false one. The reason we’re stuck repeating the past, the reason we’re even watching this necrosequel about necrosequels, is the informational regime brought about by the phone. This is why we have our backwards peasant mass culture. It’s also why we have the zombies.\nThe third stage of culture in the zettabyte age, after the hipster and the nerd, is the zombie. If the hipster represents cultural taste as sorting algorithm, and the nerd represents cultural taste determined by sorting algorithm, the zombie is the point at which we stop consuming culture-commodities altogether and start directly consuming the sorting algorithm itself.\nAccording to some middle-aged critics, our current age is the age of short-form, attention-grabbing, dopamine-boosting content. TikToks, essentially. But the individual TikTok is actually a fairly conservative and old-fashioned object: a short film, scripted and choreographed ahead of time, and then exhaustively edited afterwards. It might last seconds rather than hours, but the TikToker is still doing essentially the same kind of thing as, say, Fritz Lang. But most people don’t actually watch TikToks. Next time you’re next to someone doomscrolling through short-form video, watch what they actually do. Most of the time, they never actually watch a single twenty-second video through to the end. Flick down, vaguely register the general content of the video, immediately flick down again. Flick, flick, flick, for hours at a time, consuming literally nothing. Or, rather, consuming nothing except the algorithm, the pure flow and speed of the machine that gathers the entire world together and beams it directly at your face.\nIt’s not a question of attention spans: in the zombie era, people will engage with media in whatever way allows them direct access to that pure flow. If the medium is short-form video, they’ll scroll through it rapidly. But TikTok also features a streaming service called TikTok live, which mostly consists of women very slowly applying their makeup, or pretending to eat emoji of hamburgers, or pretending to be video game NPCs, or just wandering around, pointing out entirely ordinary objects like paving stones and bushes and other people’s cars in a slow xanned up purr—and people will watch these streams for hours on end. The real epicentre of contemporary youth culture isn’t TikTok, which is an app for cringe balding zoomers, but Twitch. This is where all the slang comes from, and it’ll be the breeding-ground for all the minor celebrities of the next few decades. Streaming has largely replaced music as the engine for new subcultures. In the same way that Instagram and YouTube (and, most recently, Substack) have been pathetically bolting TikTok clones to their services, TikTok is now desperately trying not to sink in the age of Twitch. The reason Hollywood is still stuck in the post-franchise holding pattern is that all forms of linear narrative entertainment are essentially obsolete. (A friend of mine has never sat through a single episode of the Sopranos, but he’s watched pretty much the entire show through nonlinear YouTube clips; he knows how every major character dies, just not in what order.) Those of us who are still stuck in these ancient media perceive a world in cultural stasis. But the zombies know better.\nIt takes genuinely impressive powers of engagement to be able to watch a Twitch stream. Because I take my journalism seriously I really tried to do it, but found it impossible; I kept getting distracted and picking up a book instead. These things are all eight hours long and, for someone raised on narrative media, impossibly boring. The most basic form of Twitch stream consists of watching someone else play video games, which previous generations of children could only tolerate for about three minutes before trying to grab the controller out their friend’s hands. My turn, my turn! But the zombie never expects a turn. The object of consumption isn’t the game, mediated through the streamer, but the act of streaming itself. Most streamers are reasonably good at the games they play, but this only matters in as much as it prevents any kind of friction. Many keep up a constant babble throughout, which is also unimportant. The second-most followed streamer on the platform is someone called Kai Cenat. Here’s what he says roughly midway through his most recent two-and-a-half-hour ‘short’ stream: ‘On God you guys have grown, in ways, unimaginable. Deadass. Now! Can’t even. You know what? I can’t even. I need to see, I’ma give y’all, I’ma give y’all thirty seconds to give me the best compliments. Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight. Twenty-seven. Twenty-six.’ He continues to count backwards all the way from thirty, with the mysterious omission of the number twenty-three, before reading out all the compliments his audience have posted for him. I tried another one. ‘Bro my fucking shit is fucked,’ he says. Someone else wanders into shot, visibly grumpy, and asks what they’re even doing. ‘I want some ice cream,’ says Kai Cenat. ‘You know what I’m saying, I want some ice cream man.’\nThe most popular streamer is a man called Tyler Blevins, who goes by Ninja. Blevins is apparently extremely good at playing Fortnite, but despite having blue highlights in his hair he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. On his streams he can go for a while without saying a single word, and when he does manage to eject some brief sentiment you get the sense he didn’t really need to bother. I thought I might have caught him on a bad day so I tried watching his highlights, but it’s all like this. He exclusively says things like ‘This dual hammer meta is absolutely disgusting and I really hope they patch them immediately and make them share global cooldown.’ His audience would be just as happy watching a trained pigeon peck at levers.\nOf course, not all streamers only post gaming content. You can watch someone buy and open football cards! You can watch someone pick his nose! A surprising number of people, including Kai Cenat, don’t just stream every waking moment; they also stream themselves sleeping at night. An even more surprising number of people watch them. But maybe the most magnificently pointless are the political streamers: instead of watching someone else play video games, you get to watch someone else go on Twitter. Occasionally, the political streamers will get in a feud with one another. Whatever ideological struggles these people and their followers think they’re engaged in, the real purpose of the Twitch fight is very different. It exists to create a situation in which you’re watching a stream of someone else watching a stream. The circuit is complete.\nZombification is most noticeable online, but it’s happening in every medium. When 28 Days Later was released in 2002, the emerging form in black British music was grime; today it’s drill. The difference is striking. Grime was a very specifically British genre: unlike most forms of global rap, it wasn’t an American import but had developed indigenously through UK garage and jungle. Early grime instrumentals were homemade and haphazard; from the Eskimo riddim on they tended to feature a lot of endearingly naff synths. A bunch of kids playing around with Korg Tritons in council estate bedrooms all over London. Many grime MCs had voices that were straightforwardly weird, which they deployed on high-concept tracks with elastic, constantly shifting internal rhythmic variations. Grime could be deadly serious, a chronicle of a fairly bleak existence in the crevices of Tony Blair’s Britain, but it could also be fun or sexy or experimental or absurd. It even started crossbreeding with the simultaneous indie rock revival happening in whiter, leafier corners of the country. For anyone who grew up in the hipster age, when grime was flourishing, drill music feels like an obviously inferior product. It is not even remotely fun. It has no personality and no erotic depth. The flow on every bar in every drill track is exactly the same, hitting the exact same 16th-note subdivisions: dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-DA. Drill rappers generally refuse any kind of artistic individuality. The standard outfit is a North Face puffer and a ski mask. The music is a Chicago invention, but it’s universal now: in every major city in Europe, street music means people wearing the exact same anonymising clothes and rapping in the exact same rhythm to basically interchangeable beats. An almost military uniformity.\nMy favourite example is a drill rapper called TS, real name Al-Arfat Hassan, whose bars are mostly about the gruesome violence he wants to inflict on all non-Muslims. ‘Soldier of Allah, not sad if I bleed/ Insha Allah I’ll die a shahid.’ At one point he says that if you consort with djinn he’ll take out your brain, cook it in a frying pan, and eat it. In 2024 TS was jailed for trying to build a bomb from an ISIS training video. But before he was convicted and his videos deleted from YouTube, the comments on them were uniformly positive, most of them from non-Muslims. None of these people had noticed what he was actually saying; they weren’t consuming his tracks as individual works, but as an embodiment of the form. The actual idiosyncrasy of the ISIS-supporting rapper failed to register. When people make and listen to drill, what they’re engaging with is not quite what we understand as music. It has the same relation to the 40,000-year-old musical tradition, from the first palaeolithic bone flutes to early twentieth-century grime, that Twitch streaming has to Sophocles.\nThe pinnacle of zombie culture, though, is obviously AI. Chatbots allow you to essentially skip even the pretence of cultural mediation and just interface directly with the sorting mechanism, which is exactly what generative AI really is: a device for sifting through the impossibly vast corpus of human information and finding patterns. The difference between ChatGPT and previous forms of zombie culture is that it’s totally opaque. Everyone’s individual For You Page on TikTok is notionally unique, but they’re all composed of the same stock of videos; meanwhile there is absolutely no way to find out what perverted things people are doing with AI unless one of three things happen. Either you peer at their phone on public transport, or they post screenshots on Reddit, or they kill themselves. Whenever this happens, it usually turns out that they have either been using the sorting algorithm as a therapist, using the sorting algorithm to divine the hidden secrets of the cosmos, or that they and the sorting algorithm have fallen in love. Their ideal of a healthy personal relationship is now modelled on the horrible little eunuch that lives inside their phones, and which can only ever flatter and ingratiate because at root it’s still fundamentally a machine for predicting which token you would want to appear next in a text string. It’s strange that everything is still here, cars still stop at red lights and kids still go to school, as if the world hasn’t changed, all while unknown millions of our fellow-citizens have essentially become mindless fleshy appendages to the machine.\nI’m sure you’ve read the study that found dramatically reduced brain activity among people who use AI. But if I’m honest I’ve been thinking about their brains for a while. The people I see sitting perfectly still, flicking through videos as the only life they’ll ever have slowly drains away. The people venting about their friends to a probability model. And, yes, the teenagers speaking in Twitch-chat drivel or playing drill music out their phone speakers on the bus. Maybe it’s true that for anyone used to one mode of engaging with media, the next always feels like a kind of lobotomy, but it’s hard not to feel that the people who look at screens in this particular way are some new thing, not quite conscious, not quite human. Their brains are all shrivelled, darkened, dry-aged. It should not be illegal to eat them. It’s all I can think about as I watch their eyes blur and their lips hang slack.
