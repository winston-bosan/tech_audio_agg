This is obviously what I will now be doing. My enemies list is long, and yes, you&#8217;re on it, but unlike most ordinary opinion-barfers the State Department has the power to have me kidnapped from my home in the middle of the night and secreted away to a tropical island, where cold-eyed men in greasy wifebeaters will electrocute my nuts on a zinc table until I die. A good literary beef should always come with an element of danger: if you&#8217;re not fighting someone who has the <em>ability</em> to humiliate you, you probably need to set your sights a little higher. The State Department has left a trail of blood and gore over every inhabited continent. It&#8217;s probably the biggest game out there. Let&#8217;s go.</p><p>At the end of last month, the State Department posted a meandering little Substack essay titled <em><a href=\"https://statedept.substack.com/p/the-need-for-civilizational-allies-in-europe\">The Need for Civilisational Allies in Europe</a></em>. It writes:</p><p><em>The close relationship between the United States and Europe transcends geographic proximity and transactional politics. It represents a unique bond forged in common culture, faith, familial ties, mutual assistance in times of strife, and above all, a shared Western civilisational heritage.</em></p><p><em>Our transatlantic partnership is underpinned by a rich Western tradition of natural law, virtue ethics, and national sovereignty. This tradition flows from Athens and Rome, through medieval Christianity, to English common law, and ultimately into America's founding documents. The Declaration&#8217;s revolutionary assertion that men &#8216;are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&#8217; echoes the thought of Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and other European heavyweights who recognised that all men possess natural rights that no government can arbitrate or deny. America remains indebted to Europe for this intellectual and cultural legacy.</em></p><p><em>In the aftermath of two devastating world wars, European nations sought to prevent future catastrophes by creating supranational structures that would bind nations closer together and allow for more substantial diplomatic and economic engagements.

To be honest, I don&#8217;t disagree that a lot of these European speech restrictions are bad and unhelpful, although I don&#8217;t see why the current US administration, with its policy of arresting and deporting people who write op-eds it doesn&#8217;t like, gets to be smug about this. What really interests me right now, though, are these four paragraphs. The writing is obviously awful; all government communiques might have the same bland, humourless, flatulent tone, but this is probably the first to describe Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas as &#8216;heavyweights.&#8217; The ideas are similarly unimpressive, a wet glob of regurgitated Western Civ 101. But it&#8217;s very worrying if this is what the people who currently run the empire are thinking, because absolutely every claim made over the course of these four paragraphs is completely and utterly wrong.</p><p>America and Europe are not both part of something called &#8216;Western civilisation.&#8217; America is not a product of European traditions transplanted to the New World; in fact, it&#8217;s the other way round. More than 1,500 years ago, America created Europe. There really is something genuinely distinctive about Europe, but it has absolutely nothing to do with natural law, virtue ethics, national sovereignty, culture, or tradition, and a lot more to do with the supranational structures that the State Department accuses of undermining Europe&#8217;s own values. The world is much, much weirder than the State Department&#8212;whose work mostly consists of obliterating small bit of it&#8212;could ever imagine.</p><p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. The notion of &#8216;Western civilisation&#8217; is almost exclusively an American one; Europeans simply do not talk in these terms, unless we&#8217;re trying to cash in on the American culture wars. Like most bad ideas, it exists to make you ignore what&#8217;s right in front of your face, which is that the United States of America is not a European society, but an <em>American</em> one. </p><p>In its culture, institutions, and style of government, the US has no resemblance to France or Denmark, but it does look quite a lot like the Iroquois Confederation or the Aztec Triple Alliance. European countries are integral and territorial: each one is essentially a patch of farmland that could be conquered and defended by some warlord at some point between 476 and 1945, along with its population of bonded serfs. The basic unit of American sovereignty, meanwhile, is the <em>pact</em>, in which various disparate peoples invent institutions for globbing together in a theoretically limitless affiliative chain. The United States is also theoretically limitless: it bubbled away across the continent and then, once it hit the sea, started sweeping over Pacific islands like a tsunami. It may yet swallow up Canada too. This is entirely different to the process in which European territories are expanded or nibbled away at through conquest: the territory is simply wherever the pact is in force. </p><p>European society is literate and literary; America is fundamentally imagistic. A country of cave-painters. For the few Americans who <em>can</em> read, the written word is still magical in nature, a charm or amulet, a form of medicine, rather than an ordinary system for relaying meaning. (See, for instance, the basically savage invocation of Aristotle and Aquinas above.) For Europeans, freedom is imagined in social and sadistic terms; for Americans, both before and after Columbus, the notion of freedom is based in a metaphor of physically ranging unimpeded over large tracts of land.</p><p>The original founders of the United States understood this entirely, which is why the Sons of Liberty dressed as Native Americans when they threw the Dartmouth&#8217;s cargo into Boston Harbour. The 1778 Articles of Confederation may have been substantially inspired by the Gayanashagowa or Great Law of Peace that cemented the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, but unfortunately by 1787 the project was entirely in the hands of Roman Republic cosplayers like John Adams, with the result that most accounts of the origins of American liberalism now involve this tedious traipse from Athens to Rome to Runnymede to Plymouth Rock. There have always been a few visionaries, like Walt Whitman, who saw things clearly, but only recently have people really started pointing out the obvious. The strongest counter-history is the Graeber-Wengrow thesis, which observes that at the moment of contact between Europeans and Americans, the Europeans mostly lived under systems of extreme and explicit hierarchy and domination, while the Americans mostly lived in deliberative communities, governed by elected councils, in which any chieftain&#8217;s orders could be countermanded by someone asking &#8216;Why?&#8217; (Another feature is the democratisation of violence: in Europe, the state could impose hideous punishments, but in America a whole village might collectively torture you to death.) Our entire notion of freedom, they claim, originates here. </p><p>Graeber and Wengrow don&#8217;t argue that Americans are noble savages, <em>intrinsically</em> more free than Europeans; they locate the origin of liberalism in a specifically American political history centring on the collapse of the despotic, city-building, human-sacrificing state based in Cahokia, near present-day St Louis. This might be true, but it&#8217;s worth pointing out that where contemporary America is brutal and despotic, it&#8217;s brutal and despotic in a specifically <em>American</em> way. Most European societies (after Rome, obviously) never had a sizeable domestic population of slaves; American ones did. Power in American societies was often embodied in potlatches or nextlaoallis, spectacular squanderings of wealth or life. This is essentially how the American world-empire, which continually consumes the wealth of the entire planet, governs itself. </p><p>The liberal counterpart to the reactionary slog back to Aristotle is, of course, the idea that America is a settler-colonial state built on stolen land. This is not entirely untrue&#8212;there&#8217;s been significant population turnover&#8212;but it is unhelpful. The point should be to encourage settler-descendants to more completely integrate into American society. Three hundred million Elizabeth Warrens! The first step would be to replace English the language of government and commerce with one or more native languages. Navajo has the most speakers, but Mohawk would have an obvious symbolic resonance; alternately the heartland is already dotted with Algonquian place names. Education is important; all children should be inducted into their local tribe, made to go through painful initiation rituals, and so on. Most of them don&#8217;t require any blood quantum. Longhouse summer camps. Probably a majority of Americans already vaguely believe in the Great Spirit. It can be done.</p><p>Where does that leave Europe? The argument that Europe itself is a 1,500 year old American invention is a bit fiddlier, but it does holds together. It hinges on the Yeniseian languages, which are currently spoken by about a thousand people in three miserable villages along a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, deep in the middle of Russia. (The largest of those villages is called Kellog. As far as I can tell, there&#8217;s no connection to the cornflakes.) These are particularly interesting to linguists, because as far as we can tell the closest relatives of Yeniseian are not among other Siberian languages, but the Na-Den&#233; languages of north America. These include the Athabaskan group spoken across Alaska and Yukon, but also Tlingit on the Northwest Coast and Navajo and Apache in Arizona and New Mexico. For a while the assumption was that Yeniseian was another branch of the language spoken by one of the groups of Siberians to have crossed the Bering Strait and populated the Americas, but that seems not to be the case. In 2014, a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091722\">computational phylogenetic analysis</a> by Sicoli and Holton found that Yeniseian did not branch off before other languages in the family, but belongs to a clade <em>within </em>Na-Den&#233;. In other words, the Yeniseians were back-migrants: Americans who, thousands of years later, crossed the Bering Strait in the other direction and returned to Asia.</p><p>In the third century BC, a new people appeared on the borders of China. The Chinese were not unfamiliar with steppe peoples; they&#8217;d fought and traded with the Yuezhi, the Altaic and Iranian horse-nomads, for centuries. Confucian tradition assumed that the Yuezhi were basically made of the same stuff as ordinary people; one day, they would inevitably become civilised, obey the Son of Heaven, and adopt Chinese customs. This new people were different. They could not be cooked. The Chinese called them the Xiongnu, and Sima Qian writes that &#8216;they know nothing of ritual or righteousness&#8230; this is their Heaven-endowed nature.&#8217; Something like invaders from another planet: unutterably strange, and warlike in a way China had never experienced. It was Xiongnu raids that spurred the construction of the Great Wall. They lived under a form of government that had never been seen before anywhere in the Old World: the multiethnic tribal confederation. But there must have been one particular tribe at the heart of their pact, because there was a distinct Xiongnu language. Scholars are divided on exactly what this language was. Some assume it was Turkic, because there were a lot of Turkic tribes around at the time. Some conclude it was some kind of proto-Mongolian, because later Chinese wrote that the Mongols were the same as the Xiongnu. But a few linguists, like Edwin Pulleyblank and Alexander Vovin, have tried to study the few scraps of Xiongnu that are actually available, in rough Chinese transliteration. What they find is that Xiongnu bears a marked similarity to Yeniseian. </p><p>In 129 BC, the Xiongnu were finally broken against a massive mounted Han army. The survivors fled into the interior of Asia. Some of them stayed and became tributaries of Emperor Xuan. Others, the more warlike ones, started moving west. Their migration sent ripples through the world. Other steppe peoples either joined the confederation, or started fleeing ahead of their advance, attacking whatever weaker tribes lay to their west. The Xiongnu attacked the Turks, the Turks slammed into the Scythians, the Sycthians pressed into the Germans, and the Germans fled across the borders of a soft and over-ripe Roman Empire. Finally, the people who had <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2025-06-european-huns-ancient-siberian-roots.html\">once been known as the Xiongnu</a> arrived. In 440 AD, a native American brave named Attila the Hun crossed the Danube and made war against Rome. </p><p>This was the origin of Europe. In a Roman context, Europe is just a landmass. The world is divided into citizens and noncitizens; Roman citizens in Britain and Syria have far more in common with each other than they do with their Pictish or Arab relatives just across the border. A distinctive concept of Europe, a specifically European mode of social organisation, could only emerge out of the ruins of the Empire, once the Americans had torn it open. The distinctly European form of government that emerged in the Dark Ages is the one that most of Europe still lives under today. Europe is not about nations and peoples, knights and maidens, art and culture, knowledge and power, or freedom and democracy. Its history is the history of a <em>sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy</em>.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/what-is-europe\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

This is entirely different to the process in which European territories are expanded or nibbled away at through conquest: the territory is simply wherever the pact is in force.\nEuropean society is literate and literary; America is fundamentally imagistic. A country of cave-painters. For the few Americans who can read, the written word is still magical in nature, a charm or amulet, a form of medicine, rather than an ordinary system for relaying meaning. (See, for instance, the basically savage invocation of Aristotle and Aquinas above.) For Europeans, freedom is imagined in social and sadistic terms; for Americans, both before and after Columbus, the notion of freedom is based in a metaphor of physically ranging unimpeded over large tracts of land.\nThe original founders of the United States understood this entirely, which is why the Sons of Liberty dressed as Native Americans when they threw the Dartmouth’s cargo into Boston Harbour. The 1778 Articles of Confederation may have been substantially inspired by the Gayanashagowa or Great Law of Peace that cemented the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, but unfortunately by 1787 the project was entirely in the hands of Roman Republic cosplayers like John Adams, with the result that most accounts of the origins of American liberalism now involve this tedious traipse from Athens to Rome to Runnymede to Plymouth Rock. There have always been a few visionaries, like Walt Whitman, who saw things clearly, but only recently have people really started pointing out the obvious. The strongest counter-history is the Graeber-Wengrow thesis, which observes that at the moment of contact between Europeans and Americans, the Europeans mostly lived under systems of extreme and explicit hierarchy and domination, while the Americans mostly lived in deliberative communities, governed by elected councils, in which any chieftain’s orders could be countermanded by someone asking ‘Why?’ (Another feature is the democratisation of violence: in Europe, the state could impose hideous punishments, but in America a whole village might collectively torture you to death.) Our entire notion of freedom, they claim, originates here.\nGraeber and Wengrow don’t argue that Americans are noble savages, intrinsically more free than Europeans; they locate the origin of liberalism in a specifically American political history centring on the collapse of the despotic, city-building, human-sacrificing state based in Cahokia, near present-day St Louis. This might be true, but it’s worth pointing out that where contemporary America is brutal and despotic, it’s brutal and despotic in a specifically American way. Most European societies (after Rome, obviously) never had a sizeable domestic population of slaves; American ones did. Power in American societies was often embodied in potlatches or nextlaoallis, spectacular squanderings of wealth or life. This is essentially how the American world-empire, which continually consumes the wealth of the entire planet, governs itself.\nThe liberal counterpart to the reactionary slog back to Aristotle is, of course, the idea that America is a settler-colonial state built on stolen land. This is not entirely untrue—there’s been significant population turnover—but it is unhelpful. The point should be to encourage settler-descendants to more completely integrate into American society. Three hundred million Elizabeth Warrens! The first step would be to replace English the language of government and commerce with one or more native languages. Navajo has the most speakers, but Mohawk would have an obvious symbolic resonance; alternately the heartland is already dotted with Algonquian place names. Education is important; all children should be inducted into their local tribe, made to go through painful initiation rituals, and so on. Most of them don’t require any blood quantum. Longhouse summer camps. Probably a majority of Americans already vaguely believe in the Great Spirit. It can be done.\nWhere does that leave Europe? The argument that Europe itself is a 1,500 year old American invention is a bit fiddlier, but it does holds together. It hinges on the Yeniseian languages, which are currently spoken by about a thousand people in three miserable villages along a river in Krasnoyarsk Krai, deep in the middle of Russia. (The largest of those villages is called Kellog. As far as I can tell, there’s no connection to the cornflakes.) These are particularly interesting to linguists, because as far as we can tell the closest relatives of Yeniseian are not among other Siberian languages, but the Na-Dené languages of north America. These include the Athabaskan group spoken across Alaska and Yukon, but also Tlingit on the Northwest Coast and Navajo and Apache in Arizona and New Mexico. For a while the assumption was that Yeniseian was another branch of the language spoken by one of the groups of Siberians to have crossed the Bering Strait and populated the Americas, but that seems not to be the case. In 2014, a computational phylogenetic analysis by Sicoli and Holton found that Yeniseian did not branch off before other languages in the family, but belongs to a clade within Na-Dené. In other words, the Yeniseians were back-migrants: Americans who, thousands of years later, crossed the Bering Strait in the other direction and returned to Asia.\nIn the third century BC, a new people appeared on the borders of China. The Chinese were not unfamiliar with steppe peoples; they’d fought and traded with the Yuezhi, the Altaic and Iranian horse-nomads, for centuries. Confucian tradition assumed that the Yuezhi were basically made of the same stuff as ordinary people; one day, they would inevitably become civilised, obey the Son of Heaven, and adopt Chinese customs. This new people were different. They could not be cooked. The Chinese called them the Xiongnu, and Sima Qian writes that ‘they know nothing of ritual or righteousness… this is their Heaven-endowed nature.’ Something like invaders from another planet: unutterably strange, and warlike in a way China had never experienced. It was Xiongnu raids that spurred the construction of the Great Wall. They lived under a form of government that had never been seen before anywhere in the Old World: the multiethnic tribal confederation. But there must have been one particular tribe at the heart of their pact, because there was a distinct Xiongnu language. Scholars are divided on exactly what this language was. Some assume it was Turkic, because there were a lot of Turkic tribes around at the time. Some conclude it was some kind of proto-Mongolian, because later Chinese wrote that the Mongols were the same as the Xiongnu. But a few linguists, like Edwin Pulleyblank and Alexander Vovin, have tried to study the few scraps of Xiongnu that are actually available, in rough Chinese transliteration. What they find is that Xiongnu bears a marked similarity to Yeniseian.\nIn 129 BC, the Xiongnu were finally broken against a massive mounted Han army. The survivors fled into the interior of Asia. Some of them stayed and became tributaries of Emperor Xuan. Others, the more warlike ones, started moving west. Their migration sent ripples through the world. Other steppe peoples either joined the confederation, or started fleeing ahead of their advance, attacking whatever weaker tribes lay to their west. The Xiongnu attacked the Turks, the Turks slammed into the Scythians, the Sycthians pressed into the Germans, and the Germans fled across the borders of a soft and over-ripe Roman Empire. Finally, the people who had once been known as the Xiongnu arrived. In 440 AD, a native American brave named Attila the Hun crossed the Danube and made war against Rome.\nThis was the origin of Europe. In a Roman context, Europe is just a landmass. The world is divided into citizens and noncitizens; Roman citizens in Britain and Syria have far more in common with each other than they do with their Pictish or Arab relatives just across the border. A distinctive concept of Europe, a specifically European mode of social organisation, could only emerge out of the ruins of the Empire, once the Americans had torn it open. The distinctly European form of government that emerged in the Dark Ages is the one that most of Europe still lives under today. Europe is not about nations and peoples, knights and maidens, art and culture, knowledge and power, or freedom and democracy. Its history is the history of a sexually perverted supranational bureaucracy.\nRead more",

The nefarious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO has attacked the famous GOLDSCHMITT MANOR, fabulous home of MAYA GOLDSCHMITT, the city&#8217;s LEATHERIEST HEIRESS! The villain&#8217;s attack comes during a SWANKY SOIR&#201;E for investors in METZITZAH SYSTEMS, the high-tech Israeli arms manufacturer responsible for the BABYMASHER 3000, a loitering munition used to DEVASTATING EFFECT in maternity wards across the Gaza Strip! PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO, an adjunct in COMPARATIVE LITERATURE at the local university, has barricaded himself into the OPULENT BALLROOM at GOLDSCHMITT MANOR with five hostages! These are MAYA GOLDSCHMITT herself, billionaire playboy BRICK KOPF, local philanthropist RONNY LUFTMENSCH, beloved TV personality SUSAN PLAPEL, and OMER BALOG, the brilliant bald-headed boffin CTO of METZITZAH SYSTEMS! The devious PROFESSOR has wired his hostages with EXPLOSIVES&#8212;simply for the crime of BEING JEWISH! The bombs are attached to a DEAD MAN&#8217;S SWITCH, meaning that if the POLICE SNIPERS arranged around GOLDSCHMITT MANOR take a shot, all of SOPHISTICO&#8217;s hostages will POP LIKE WET CONFETTI! With no other recourse, the authorities have sent in the bumbling JIM PLAYNE, amateur hostage negotiator, to try to talk the CRAZED PROFESSOR down! Will PLAYNE manage to make a cogent case against INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE as a LEGITIMATE FORM OF RESISTANCE? Or will he himself end up being seduced by the MAD PROFESSOR&#8217;S DEMENTED IDEOLOGY? Read on to find out&#8230;</em></p><div><hr></div><p>PLAYNE: Nice barricades you&#8217;ve got here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Thanks.</p><p>PLAYNE: You&#8217;ve put all these bits of wood together very precisely. It looks great. If I were Maya Goldschmitt I&#8217;d keep them up afterwards.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I watch Japanese woodworking on TikTok. It&#8217;s relaxing.</p><p>PLAYNE: Yeah?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: It&#8217;s called sashimono. They do joinery without any nails or glue. It all rests on these highly complex joints carved using simple chisels called nomi. I can show you some videos if you like.</p><p>PLAYNE: That&#8217;d be&#8212;maybe afterwards? You&#8217;ve also&#8212;it looks like you&#8217;ve taken a couple of hostages here.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I&#8217;m striking back against the machinery of death.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Indistinct panicked mumbling through their gags</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: And how are we feeling about this? Any, you know, regrets?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Pretty good, to be honest. </p><p>PLAYNE: Alright. Mind walking me through how we got here?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Well, basically how it started was that I couldn&#8217;t sleep. Every day, I watch videos of what&#8217;s happening in Gaza. The most horrible, horrible stuff. The other day I saw a father holding up half of his daughter. Half of a little girl. An Israeli bomb had exploded inside their house and it just cut her body in half. She&#8217;d never hurt anyone. Or there&#8217;s videos of babies, crying babies with exposed ribcages. They don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t have any food. Every day it&#8217;s like this. There&#8217;s been an airstrike on a school. There&#8217;s been a team of medics shot one by one and buried in a mass grave. They&#8217;ve gunned down dozens of hungry people trying to get food. They targeted the home of a paediatrician and killed nine of her children. Kids she loved and cared for all their lives, and Israel wiped them all out in an instant. For no reason. So I see all of this happening, and then I can&#8217;t sleep. I keep lying in bed, thinking about it, until it&#8217;s five, six in the morning. How am I supposed to sleep in my warm bed, in my safe home, while <em>this</em> is happening to my fellow human beings? How can anyone just go about their normal lives when we&#8217;re watching a live-streamed genocide, twenty-four hours a day? I think the reason I couldn&#8217;t sleep was my conscience. It was telling me I had a duty to do something. So this is me doing something.</p><p>PLAYNE: You watch snuff films before bed and then you can&#8217;t sleep.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Yeah. Do you think I should just <em>ignore</em> it? Pretend it isn&#8217;t happening? Wall myself off?</p><p>PLAYNE: No, no. Just saying. Let&#8217;s go back. You said you had a duty to do something. But there&#8217;s lots of ways of doing something. You could have, you know, marched&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Ha. Of course they&#8217;d send a lib. Look, imagine this. Imagine it isn&#8217;t Gaza. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m right here, going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun&#8212;</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, you <em>are</em> right here, going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Let me finish. Imagine I go into your house at night and [<em>making gun fingers</em>] bang, I murder your wife. Bang, murder your son. While they&#8217;re sleeping. Then I take out a saw and <em>cut your daughter in half</em>. Next night, I do it again, to your neighbour. And the next night, and the night after that, for nearly two years, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop me. In fact, they&#8217;re supplying me with ammunition. And then in the daytime, they let me go on the TV and explain that I had to do it because those kids made me feel unsafe, and by the way I&#8217;m the most moral man in town, and if you have any problem with me breaking into houses and wiping out families, you&#8217;re some kind of <em>bigot</em>. I keep getting away with it, and I keep killing. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you&#8217;d sleep well at night? Would you choose non-violence? Would you go on a protest march against me? Write a letter to the Mayor? Fight against hatred with the power of love? Or would you do whatever it took to stop me before I killed again? </p><p>PLAYNE: I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the same.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: No. Because in my thought experiment it&#8217;s happening <em>here</em>, and in reality it&#8217;s happening somewhere else. A lot of people just don&#8217;t view Palestinians as fully human. When <em>their</em> children are cut in half it doesn&#8217;t matter. But I refuse to care less about someone&#8217;s life just because they live far away.</p><p>PLAYNE: I guess what I meant is that, like I said, you really are going into people&#8217;s houses with a gun. You say you&#8217;re so horrified by violence, but here you are, committing acts of violence.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: OK, now we&#8217;re getting into it. You&#8217;re against violence? All violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Yes. I think so.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But right now there&#8217;s snipers pointing guns at me through the window. I don&#8217;t think you <em>want</em> them to take me out, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d prefer it if everyone could leave this room alive. But if they shot me in the middle of an active hostage situation, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d be morally outraged. So there&#8217;s clearly some violence you&#8217;re willing to accept and some violence you&#8217;re not. </p><p>PLAYNE: That&#8217;s true.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: So what&#8217;s the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: Well, the police, they&#8217;ve got legal authority&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Exactly. Their violence is <em>legitimate</em>. It comes from the state. The state can send people to prison, but when I keep people in a room against their will it&#8217;s hostage-taking. If the state thinks parents are doing a bad job, it can kidnap their children; I can&#8217;t. And Israel is a state, an internationally recognised sovereign power, which is why it&#8217;s allowed to cut little girls in half, and private citizens are not. But there is such a thing in international law as the <em>right to resist</em>. Did you know that? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that we &#8216;have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.&#8217; So illegitimate individual violence is actually <em>legitimate</em> under the law. The distinction contradicts itself. So what else? How else do you tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?</p><p>PLAYNE: I don&#8217;t know.</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Muffled sounds of alarm getting louder</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: But look, the police wouldn&#8217;t be here if you hadn&#8217;t walked into a party full of people and started pointing guns at them. We&#8217;re trying to put an <em>end</em> to violence. That&#8217;s just not the same as deliberately starting it. </p><p>SOPHISTICO: Sure.</p><p>PLAYNE: So why don&#8217;t we try, maybe, letting one of the hostages&#8212;</p><p>SOPHISTICO: But I didn&#8217;t initiate the violence here. Every single one of these people is an investor in Metzitzah Systems. They are all <em>making money</em> out of a campaign of mass slaughter being waged on the other side of the world. I&#8217;m just responding. The violence is already taking place, and I&#8217;m the one trying to end it. Similarly, the violence on October 7th was a response to decades of illegal blockade, occupation, and colonisation against the people of Palestine. The distinction between initiating violence and responding with violence also doesn&#8217;t hold. There&#8217;s always a precedent. </p><p>PLAYNE: So why don&#8217;t you support the war then?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: What do you mean?</p><p>PLAYNE: You say this violence is justified by a previous act of violence. So doesn&#8217;t that apply to Israeli violence as well? How do <em>you</em> tell the difference between good and bad violence?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I was getting there.</p><p>PLAYNE: Go on, then.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Acceptable violence is the violence that liberates the oppressed from their oppression. Liberals like you only accept violence when it&#8217;s &#8216;legitimate,&#8217; in other words, when it&#8217;s used by the established order to crush and pacify the powerless. I&#8217;m the opposite. </p><p>PLAYNE: Right.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Good, isn&#8217;t it?</p><p>PLAYNE: I&#8217;m thinking about it. I worry it might have some holes.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: Like what?</p><p>PLAYNE: I mean, do you really think that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing? Liberating the oppressed from their oppression?</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I&#8217;m trying.</p><p>PLAYNE: I don&#8217;t know if I buy it. If you were really serious about liberating the oppressed, you wouldn&#8217;t be taking hostages and hooking them up to explosives. Let&#8217;s say our conversation here ends badly, and you blow up all these people here&#8212;</p><p>HOSTAGES: [<em>Squirming in panic</em>]</p><p>PLAYNE: &#8212;what do you think happens next? Let me tell you. Everyone you hate&#8212;<em>they</em> get to be the victim now. You&#8217;ve just given them a big gory piece of evidence that <em>they&#8217;re</em> the oppressed, not you, which means <em>their</em> violence is justified, not yours. These categories are more malleable than you think. And a lot of people will start agreeing with them, because most people don&#8217;t want to be on the same side as a crazy killer. So everyone who&#8217;s been trying to do the serious work of advocating for Palestine now has to deal with the PR nightmare another violent extremist in their ranks. There are reams of evidence that this kind of violent action is almost always counterproductive. Plus, just like you said, every violent act provokes a violent response. How do you think the Israelis will respond to this? Will they bomb Gaza <em>less</em>? Do you really think this will put a <em>stop</em> to the cycle of violence? It seems to me that all you&#8217;ve done is snuffed out five human lives forever, and made things <em>worse</em> for the people you claim to care about in the process. And yourself, of course. You&#8217;re Merry Levov, blowing up a post office. Pointless waste.</p><p>SOPHISTICO: I see. So now you don&#8217;t think violence is <em>bad</em>.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nTERROR in the heart of the city! The nefarious PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO has attacked the famous GOLDSCHMITT MANOR, fabulous home of MAYA GOLDSCHMITT, the city’s LEATHERIEST HEIRESS! The villain’s attack comes during a SWANKY SOIRÉE for investors in METZITZAH SYSTEMS, the high-tech Israeli arms manufacturer responsible for the BABYMASHER 3000, a loitering munition used to DEVASTATING EFFECT in maternity wards across the Gaza Strip! PROFESSOR SOPHISTICO, an adjunct in COMPARATIVE LITERATURE at the local university, has barricaded himself into the OPULENT BALLROOM at GOLDSCHMITT MANOR with five hostages! These are MAYA GOLDSCHMITT herself, billionaire playboy BRICK KOPF, local philanthropist RONNY LUFTMENSCH, beloved TV personality SUSAN PLAPEL, and OMER BALOG, the brilliant bald-headed boffin CTO of METZITZAH SYSTEMS! The devious PROFESSOR has wired his hostages with EXPLOSIVES—simply for the crime of BEING JEWISH! The bombs are attached to a DEAD MAN’S SWITCH, meaning that if the POLICE SNIPERS arranged around GOLDSCHMITT MANOR take a shot, all of SOPHISTICO’s hostages will POP LIKE WET CONFETTI! With no other recourse, the authorities have sent in the bumbling JIM PLAYNE, amateur hostage negotiator, to try to talk the CRAZED PROFESSOR down! Will PLAYNE manage to make a cogent case against INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE as a LEGITIMATE FORM OF RESISTANCE? Or will he himself end up being seduced by the MAD PROFESSOR’S DEMENTED IDEOLOGY? Read on to find out…\n\nPLAYNE: Nice barricades you’ve got here.\nSOPHISTICO: Thanks.\nPLAYNE: You’ve put all these bits of wood together very precisely. It looks great. If I were Maya Goldschmitt I’d keep them up afterwards.\nSOPHISTICO: I watch Japanese woodworking on TikTok. It’s relaxing.\nPLAYNE: Yeah?\nSOPHISTICO: It’s called sashimono. They do joinery without any nails or glue. It all rests on these highly complex joints carved using simple chisels called nomi. I can show you some videos if you like.\nPLAYNE: That’d be—maybe afterwards? You’ve also—it looks like you’ve taken a couple of hostages here.\nSOPHISTICO: I’m striking back against the machinery of death.\nHOSTAGES: [ Indistinct panicked mumbling through their gags]\nPLAYNE: And how are we feeling about this? Any, you know, regrets?\nSOPHISTICO: Pretty good, to be honest.\nPLAYNE: Alright. Mind walking me through how we got here?\nSOPHISTICO: Well, basically how it started was that I couldn’t sleep. Every day, I watch videos of what’s happening in Gaza. The most horrible, horrible stuff. The other day I saw a father holding up half of his daughter. Half of a little girl. An Israeli bomb had exploded inside their house and it just cut her body in half. She’d never hurt anyone. Or there’s videos of babies, crying babies with exposed ribcages. They don’t understand why they can’t have any food. Every day it’s like this. There’s been an airstrike on a school. There’s been a team of medics shot one by one and buried in a mass grave. They’ve gunned down dozens of hungry people trying to get food. They targeted the home of a paediatrician and killed nine of her children. Kids she loved and cared for all their lives, and Israel wiped them all out in an instant. For no reason. So I see all of this happening, and then I can’t sleep. I keep lying in bed, thinking about it, until it’s five, six in the morning. How am I supposed to sleep in my warm bed, in my safe home, while this is happening to my fellow human beings? How can anyone just go about their normal lives when we’re watching a live-streamed genocide, twenty-four hours a day? I think the reason I couldn’t sleep was my conscience. It was telling me I had a duty to do something. So this is me doing something.\nPLAYNE: You watch snuff films before bed and then you can’t sleep.\nSOPHISTICO: Yeah. Do you think I should just ignore it? Pretend it isn’t happening? Wall myself off?\nPLAYNE: No, no. Just saying. Let’s go back. You said you had a duty to do something. But there’s lots of ways of doing something. You could have, you know, marched—\nSOPHISTICO: Ha. Of course they’d send a lib. Look, imagine this. Imagine it isn’t Gaza. Let’s say I’m right here, going into people’s houses with a gun—\nPLAYNE: Well, you are right here, going into people’s houses with a gun.\nSOPHISTICO: Let me finish. Imagine I go into your house at night and [ making gun fingers] bang, I murder your wife. Bang, murder your son. While they’re sleeping. Then I take out a saw and cut your daughter in half. Next night, I do it again, to your neighbour. And the next night, and the night after that, for nearly two years, and the police do absolutely nothing to stop me. In fact, they’re supplying me with ammunition. And then in the daytime, they let me go on the TV and explain that I had to do it because those kids made me feel unsafe, and by the way I’m the most moral man in town, and if you have any problem with me breaking into houses and wiping out families, you’re some kind of bigot. I keep getting away with it, and I keep killing. What would you do in that situation? Do you think you’d sleep well at night? Would you choose non-violence? Would you go on a protest march against me? Write a letter to the Mayor? Fight against hatred with the power of love? Or would you do whatever it took to stop me before I killed again?\nPLAYNE: I’m not sure it’s the same.\nSOPHISTICO: No. Because in my thought experiment it’s happening here, and in reality it’s happening somewhere else. A lot of people just don’t view Palestinians as fully human. When their children are cut in half it doesn’t matter. But I refuse to care less about someone’s life just because they live far away.\nPLAYNE: I guess what I meant is that, like I said, you really are going into people’s houses with a gun. You say you’re so horrified by violence, but here you are, committing acts of violence.\nSOPHISTICO: OK, now we’re getting into it. You’re against violence? All violence?\nPLAYNE: Yes. I think so.\nSOPHISTICO: But right now there’s snipers pointing guns at me through the window. I don’t think you want them to take me out, I’m sure you’d prefer it if everyone could leave this room alive. But if they shot me in the middle of an active hostage situation, I don’t think you’d be morally outraged. So there’s clearly some violence you’re willing to accept and some violence you’re not.\nPLAYNE: That’s true.\nSOPHISTICO: So what’s the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?\nPLAYNE: Well, the police, they’ve got legal authority—\nSOPHISTICO: Exactly. Their violence is legitimate. It comes from the state. The state can send people to prison, but when I keep people in a room against their will it’s hostage-taking. If the state thinks parents are doing a bad job, it can kidnap their children; I can’t. And Israel is a state, an internationally recognised sovereign power, which is why it’s allowed to cut little girls in half, and private citizens are not. But there is such a thing in international law as the right to resist. Did you know that? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that we ‘have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression.’ So illegitimate individual violence is actually legitimate under the law. The distinction contradicts itself. So what else? How else do you tell the difference between acceptable and unacceptable violence?\nPLAYNE: I don’t know.\nHOSTAGES: [ Muffled sounds of alarm getting louder]\nPLAYNE: But look, the police wouldn’t be here if you hadn’t walked into a party full of people and started pointing guns at them. We’re trying to put an end to violence. That’s just not the same as deliberately starting it.\nSOPHISTICO: Sure.\nPLAYNE: So why don’t we try, maybe, letting one of the hostages—\nSOPHISTICO: But I didn’t initiate the violence here. Every single one of these people is an investor in Metzitzah Systems. They are all making money out of a campaign of mass slaughter being waged on the other side of the world. I’m just responding. The violence is already taking place, and I’m the one trying to end it. Similarly, the violence on October 7th was a response to decades of illegal blockade, occupation, and colonisation against the people of Palestine. The distinction between initiating violence and responding with violence also doesn’t hold. There’s always a precedent.\nPLAYNE: So why don’t you support the war then?\nSOPHISTICO: What do you mean?\nPLAYNE: You say this violence is justified by a previous act of violence. So doesn’t that apply to Israeli violence as well? How do you tell the difference between good and bad violence?\nSOPHISTICO: I was getting there.\nPLAYNE: Go on, then.\nSOPHISTICO: Acceptable violence is the violence that liberates the oppressed from their oppression. Liberals like you only accept violence when it’s ‘legitimate,’ in other words, when it’s used by the established order to crush and pacify the powerless. I’m the opposite.\nPLAYNE: Right.\nSOPHISTICO: Good, isn’t it?\nPLAYNE: I’m thinking about it. I worry it might have some holes.\nSOPHISTICO: Like what?\nPLAYNE: I mean, do you really think that’s what you’re doing? Liberating the oppressed from their oppression?\nSOPHISTICO: I’m trying.\nPLAYNE: I don’t know if I buy it. If you were really serious about liberating the oppressed, you wouldn’t be taking hostages and hooking them up to explosives. Let’s say our conversation here ends badly, and you blow up all these people here—\nHOSTAGES: [ Squirming in panic]\nPLAYNE: —what do you think happens next? Let me tell you. Everyone you hate— they get to be the victim now. You’ve just given them a big gory piece of evidence that they’re the oppressed, not you, which means their violence is justified, not yours. These categories are more malleable than you think. And a lot of people will start agreeing with them, because most people don’t want to be on the same side as a crazy killer. So everyone who’s been trying to do the serious work of advocating for Palestine now has to deal with the PR nightmare another violent extremist in their ranks. There are reams of evidence that this kind of violent action is almost always counterproductive. Plus, just like you said, every violent act provokes a violent response. How do you think the Israelis will respond to this? Will they bomb Gaza less? Do you really think this will put a stop to the cycle of violence? It seems to me that all you’ve done is snuffed out five human lives forever, and made things worse for the people you claim to care about in the process. And yourself, of course. You’re Merry Levov, blowing up a post office. Pointless waste.\nSOPHISTICO: I see. So now you don’t think violence is bad. It’s just ineffective.\nPLAYNE: Look, man, I’m a hostage negotiator. I’m just trying to get you to let these people go. If I can sell you on violence being bad, I’ll say that. If I can sell you on violence being ineffective, that works too. If I thought I could convince you that the established order isn’t so awful, I’d give it a shot.\nSOPHISTICO: It’s difficult to have an honest discussion with someone who doesn’t really believe in anything.\nPLAYNE: Does it matter what I believe? I just accept whatever’s been convincingly demonstrated to me. You should try it. You know I’m right.\nSOPHISTICO: No. You’re not. Imagine this. It’s World War Two and your country is occupied by the Nazis. They’re carting away all the Jews and Roma to concentration camps. You watch it happen every day. Now, if you want, you can run away into the hills and join up with the partisans. Fight the Nazis. But the Nazis have a reprisals policy. For every one of their soldiers that the partisans kill, they will go into a village, line up ten civilians against a wall, and shoot them. So should you resist the Nazis?

It&#8217;s gone. Whatever still exists is just a remnant, barely hanging on in its own country, and in a few decades it&#8217;ll probably be snuffed out for good. The English way of existing in the world is steadily being eroded by foreign customs. Already, the country I grew up in is unrecognisable, full of strange and angry people spouting misshapen foreign ideas. Foreign ideas about the need for a <em>shared</em> <em>community</em>. About how society isn&#8217;t just a collection of individuals, but a group with a <em>common purpose</em>, growing out of the traditional structures of kith and kin. About a people deeply rooted in a particular place, and about the placeless migrants like locusts on the wind, tearing it all apart. This stuff isn&#8217;t just on the fringes any more: this month, even the Prime Minister started talking about how uncontrolled immigration means &#8216;we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.&#8217; What hope is there for England when even its leaders are spouting this dreck?</p><p>You have never been deeply rooted in any particular place, and you have always been an island of strangers. The current level of migration might not be to everyone&#8217;s benefit, or even really <em>anyone&#8217;s</em> benefit (more on that later), but it can&#8217;t destroy what doesn&#8217;t exist. There <em>used</em> to be a people who were deeply rooted in this place, a millennium and a half ago, but not any more. They went with the giants. </p><p>When the first refugees came here after the sack of Troy, they found the place wild and empty, but not silent: at night, in the hills and the forests, they trembled at the inarticulate groans of giants. The people built cities, and the giants came howling out of the hills to smash down the walls. Geoffey of Monmouth says the last of the giants were killed by Brutus and Corineus in Cernyw, but later at least one giant, Br&#226;n Fendigaidd son of Ll&#375;r, became king of the Britons. They must have made some kind of peace; after that it was the blood of the giants that ruled. Br&#226;n was so huge that no house could contain him. After his sister Branwen was mistreated by Matholwch king of Ireland, Br&#226;n Fendigaidd sent an army from all the one hundred and fifty-four districts of Britain to sail over and rescue her, but because he was too big to fit in a ship he had to wade across the Irish Sea. When the swineherds of Ireland saw him in the distance, they mistook him for a mountain rising out of the water, and his two furious eyes for two gleaming lakes. By the end Br&#226;n had laid waste to so much of Ireland that the only survivors were five pregnant women hiding in a cave, but in the fighting his foot was pierced by a poisoned spear. He told his followers to cut off his head and bury it at the Gwynfryn in Caer Lud, facing south. As long as his head was in that spot, no oppression would ever come from across the sea to the Island of Britain. The noble triads in the Red Book of Hergest record that the burying of Br&#226;n&#8217;s head was the first of the Three Fortunate Concealments; the third of the Three Unfortunate Unconcealments was when Arthur decided to dig it up again. It hurt his pride to imagine that the land would need any protection other than himself, so he disinterred the head, and then he defended these shores until he died. And then, oozing against the beaches of this island like an algae bloom, the Saxons came. </p><p>It might not be nice to point this out, it might not be politically correct, but the Saxons really don&#8217;t belong here. Even after all this time, fifteen hundred years of this great bunch of lads tactically chundering all over Arthur&#8217;s kingdom, they&#8217;re still uncomfortable in the land. Like their thing with the weather. The Saxons will not stop complaining about the weather. The springs are too grey. The summers are too mild. It&#8217;s literally all they talk about, how endlessly disappointed they are by this country&#8217;s weather, and how desperate they are to briefly fly off somewhere else. Well, not to be rude, but if you hate it so much, then what the fuck are you doing here? If you wanted a long, hot, dry summer, and a fairytale winter where it always snows on Christmas, you should have stayed in the marshes of the Elbe where you came from. Why would you come to an island with such a witchy, mystic climate, silver curtains of rain, fog, weather that changes unpredictably several times a day&#8212;and then jump on the first RyanAir to Marbella? Why didn&#8217;t you join up with the Visigoths instead? You had a choice.</p><p>But this island was always just a brief staging-post for the Saxons: a few hundred years here to gather supplies, work on new types of rigging, and then off again to spread their sickness across the world. This is why the salmon-hunting grounds of the Tlingit and Salish, where animal ancestors grinned from wooden poles in the mist, are now part of something called British Columbia. Why you can fly to Te Ika-a-Maui, an island lost in endless ocean, on a wild and distant hemisphere, where all the old stories are about canoes, taro, salt-spray, gods woven from coconut fibre, and find it full of awkward people with wonky smiles dunking biscuits in milky tea. </p><p>Are they comfortable there? Of course not. The Saxons aren&#8217;t comfortable anywhere. There&#8217;s never been a people that squirms so awkwardly inside their own skin. Talking about sex famously throws them into crisis, but so does talking about <em>anything</em>. They sit on trains, silent. On the bus, silent.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nEngland is over. It’s gone. Whatever still exists is just a remnant, barely hanging on in its own country, and in a few decades it’ll probably be snuffed out for good. The English way of existing in the world is steadily being eroded by foreign customs. Already, the country I grew up in is unrecognisable, full of strange and angry people spouting misshapen foreign ideas. Foreign ideas about the need for a shared community. About how society isn’t just a collection of individuals, but a group with a common purpose, growing out of the traditional structures of kith and kin. About a people deeply rooted in a particular place, and about the placeless migrants like locusts on the wind, tearing it all apart. This stuff isn’t just on the fringes any more: this month, even the Prime Minister started talking about how uncontrolled immigration means ‘we risk becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together.’ What hope is there for England when even its leaders are spouting this dreck?\nYou have never been deeply rooted in any particular place, and you have always been an island of strangers. The current level of migration might not be to everyone’s benefit, or even really anyone’s benefit (more on that later), but it can’t destroy what doesn’t exist. There used to be a people who were deeply rooted in this place, a millennium and a half ago, but not any more. They went with the giants.\nWhen the first refugees came here after the sack of Troy, they found the place wild and empty, but not silent: at night, in the hills and the forests, they trembled at the inarticulate groans of giants. The people built cities, and the giants came howling out of the hills to smash down the walls. Geoffey of Monmouth says the last of the giants were killed by Brutus and Corineus in Cernyw, but later at least one giant, Brân Fendigaidd son of Llŷr, became king of the Britons. They must have made some kind of peace; after that it was the blood of the giants that ruled. Brân was so huge that no house could contain him. After his sister Branwen was mistreated by Matholwch king of Ireland, Brân Fendigaidd sent an army from all the one hundred and fifty-four districts of Britain to sail over and rescue her, but because he was too big to fit in a ship he had to wade across the Irish Sea. When the swineherds of Ireland saw him in the distance, they mistook him for a mountain rising out of the water, and his two furious eyes for two gleaming lakes. By the end Brân had laid waste to so much of Ireland that the only survivors were five pregnant women hiding in a cave, but in the fighting his foot was pierced by a poisoned spear. He told his followers to cut off his head and bury it at the Gwynfryn in Caer Lud, facing south. As long as his head was in that spot, no oppression would ever come from across the sea to the Island of Britain. The noble triads in the Red Book of Hergest record that the burying of Brân’s head was the first of the Three Fortunate Concealments; the third of the Three Unfortunate Unconcealments was when Arthur decided to dig it up again. It hurt his pride to imagine that the land would need any protection other than himself, so he disinterred the head, and then he defended these shores until he died. And then, oozing against the beaches of this island like an algae bloom, the Saxons came.\nIt might not be nice to point this out, it might not be politically correct, but the Saxons really don’t belong here. Even after all this time, fifteen hundred years of this great bunch of lads tactically chundering all over Arthur’s kingdom, they’re still uncomfortable in the land. Like their thing with the weather. The Saxons will not stop complaining about the weather. The springs are too grey. The summers are too mild. It’s literally all they talk about, how endlessly disappointed they are by this country’s weather, and how desperate they are to briefly fly off somewhere else. Well, not to be rude, but if you hate it so much, then what the fuck are you doing here? If you wanted a long, hot, dry summer, and a fairytale winter where it always snows on Christmas, you should have stayed in the marshes of the Elbe where you came from. Why would you come to an island with such a witchy, mystic climate, silver curtains of rain, fog, weather that changes unpredictably several times a day—and then jump on the first RyanAir to Marbella? Why didn’t you join up with the Visigoths instead? You had a choice.\nBut this island was always just a brief staging-post for the Saxons: a few hundred years here to gather supplies, work on new types of rigging, and then off again to spread their sickness across the world. This is why the salmon-hunting grounds of the Tlingit and Salish, where animal ancestors grinned from wooden poles in the mist, are now part of something called British Columbia. Why you can fly to Te Ika-a-Maui, an island lost in endless ocean, on a wild and distant hemisphere, where all the old stories are about canoes, taro, salt-spray, gods woven from coconut fibre, and find it full of awkward people with wonky smiles dunking biscuits in milky tea.\nAre they comfortable there? Of course not. The Saxons aren’t comfortable anywhere. There’s never been a people that squirms so awkwardly inside their own skin. Talking about sex famously throws them into crisis, but so does talking about anything. They sit on trains, silent. On the bus, silent. They spend first dates mutually dabbing at their phones. In the rest of Europe people might go to a restaurant together on their lunch breaks, but not the Saxon, who sits silently by himself on a park bench, eating a packaged sandwich from M&S. The only time they can bear to talk to each other is when they’re at the pub, coked up and drunk.

Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn&#8217;t move out of his parents&#8217; home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Li&#232;ge, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour&#8217;s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Li&#232;ge, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana&#8217;s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio T&#233;l&#233;vision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu&#8217;s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of <em>civilisation</em>. </p><p>Ruggiu&#8217;s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he&#8217;d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don&#8217;t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I&#8217;m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I&#8217;m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.</p><p>Anyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, <em>On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation</em>. The appearance raised some hackles&#8212;there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events&#8212;because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/roganverse-split/682593/\">gushed</a> in the <em>Atlantic</em>, finally &#8216;someone had been on Joe Rogan&#8217;s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.&#8217; Murray&#8217;s complaint is that Rogan&#8217;s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the &#8216;chief villain&#8217; of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place &#8216;because the Germans didn&#8217;t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,&#8217; and that Nazi-occupied Europe was &#8216;infinitely preferable in every way&#8217; to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world&#8217;s most popular podcast, but he&#8217;s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers <em>lack the proper credentials</em>. &#8216;My point is, this is not a serious historian. He&#8217;s not a historian.&#8217; Later: &#8216;He&#8217;s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives&#8230; I think it&#8217;s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.&#8217; Another guest asks: &#8216;What&#8217;s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?&#8217; Murray snaps back: &#8216;I think authority matters.&#8217;</p><p>One reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you&#8217;re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don&#8217;t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray&#8217;s books for anything of intellectual merit. They&#8217;re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets. </p><p>The other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it <em>on the Joe Rogan show</em>. I&#8217;m not a listener, because I&#8217;m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you&#8217;re not really <em>listening</em>; you&#8217;re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you&#8217;re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I&#8217;m aware of what Rogan <em>is</em>. He has the world&#8217;s most popular podcast because he&#8217;s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we&#8217;re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/ancient-apocalypse-netflix-why-graham-hancock-thinks-everything/\">I interviewed Graham Hancock</a> for the <em>Telegraph</em> a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England&#8217;s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they&#8217;re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It&#8217;s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it&#8217;s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don&#8217;t blame Rogan for this; he&#8217;s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.</p><p>Of course, Douglas Murray couldn&#8217;t say any of this. He couldn&#8217;t make the obvious argument&#8212;that the problem is <em>genocide denialism</em>, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials&#8212;because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He&#8217;s busy denying the genocide that&#8217;s happening right now. And he knows it.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There are many reasons <em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here&#8217;s a sample passage. Murray&#8217;s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what&#8217;s coming. &#8216;There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.&#8217; It&#8217;s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not <em>technically</em> lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that&#8217;s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic &#8216;spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.&#8217; Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it&#8217;s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Among the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.</p></li><li><p>Democracies are good.</p></li><li><p>Death cults are evil. More than that, they&#8217;re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were <em>not</em> a death cult, because they at least &#8216;sought to cover over their crimes,&#8217; which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: &#8216;Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.&#8217; Later: &#8216;Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.&#8217; Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.</p></li><li><p>Israel is a democracy.</p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s opponents&#8212;that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they&#8217;re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe&#8212;are death cults.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, the war in Gaza is a &#8216;fight between good and evil,&#8217; and we should support Israel.</p></li></ol><p>But this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn&#8217;t bother to actually make this argument; instead of <em>saying</em> any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the &#8216;death cult&#8217; that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of &#8216;democracy.&#8217; At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, &#8216;What Happened,&#8217; is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, &#8216;What I Saw,&#8217; is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, &#8216;How the World Turned,&#8217; is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, &#8216;The Disconnect,&#8217; is appropriately named, because it&#8217;s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, &#8216;From Defeat into Victory,&#8217; is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s essentially it.</p><p>Along the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren&#8217;t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. &#8216;We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.&#8217; (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn&#8217;t assume he&#8217;s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein&#8217;s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it&#8217;s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, <em>Israel Hayom</em>, <em>Arutz Sheva</em>, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn&#8217;t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which &#8216;makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.&#8217;</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair. I don&#8217;t disagree with Murray about <em>everything</em>. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/but-not-like-this\">as I wrote at the time</a>, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his &#8216;death cult&#8217; category, but maybe we should consider it. It can&#8217;t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let&#8217;s start there.</p><p>What does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he&#8217;d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that &#8216;we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left&#8230; I killed a girl, she was 12, but I&#8217;m looking for a baby.&#8217; The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they&#8217;d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren&#8217;t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the <em>rapists </em>be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. &#8216;If he is a Zionist,&#8217; said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, &#8216;everything is legitimate to do! Everything!&#8217; And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren&#8217;t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. &#8216;They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.&#8217;</p><p>I could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let&#8217;s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be&#8217;er Sheva, and it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">endorsed</a> by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn&#8217;t say &#8216;death to the Jews&#8217; but &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/17/miami-shooting-israeli-men\">death to the Arabs</a>.&#8217; Those children were picked off by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html\">Israeli snipers</a>. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: &#8216;This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don&#8217;t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?&#8217; Well: good question.</p><p>If we accept Murray&#8217;s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, <em>also</em> a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There&#8217;s no history. It&#8217;s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.</p><p>It should not be so easy to rip apart Murray&#8217;s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?</p><p>This is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the &#8216;Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.&#8217; But he&#8217;s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, &#8216;they did not mention that these &#8220;journalists&#8221; were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.&#8217; Well, Douglas, the reason they don&#8217;t mention it is that it&#8217;s <em>not true</em>. The journalists were using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/\">an ordinary commercial drone</a> to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/en-journalists-drones-israeli-army-gaza/\">habitually kills</a> journalists who do this.) What&#8217;s Murray&#8217;s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that <em>one in every two houses in Gaza</em> contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it&#8217;d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas&#8217;s extraordinary state capacity. Murray&#8217;s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There&#8217;s cream dripping off his chin. </p><p>The reason he does all this is that he is <em>an asset</em>. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray&#8217;s in Israel, he&#8217;s not <em>finding things out for himself</em>; he&#8217;s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn&#8217;t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he&#8217;s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let <em>anyone</em> wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> (What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There&#8217;s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they&#8217;re just evil. He literally says this. &#8216;There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition&#8212;to take away life.&#8217;) The Netanyahu government has even given him <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-796234\">a special award</a> for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that &#8216;Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.&#8217; He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.</p><p>I think Herzog was wrong. Murray&#8217;s toadying comes at the <em>cost</em> of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely <em>bad</em> advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs <em>or</em> Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he&#8217;s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn&#8217;t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he&#8217;s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him. </p><p><em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> reached number 1 on the <em>Sunday Times</em> bestseller list. It got the second spot on the <em>New York Times</em>&#8217;. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can&#8217;t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?</p><p>I do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There&#8217;s evil in me as well. I&#8217;m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I&#8217;m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th&#8212;and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since&#8212;have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone&#8217;s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our &#8216;search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,&#8217; which is why we&#8217;re &#8216;missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.&#8217; Instead of trying to <em>understand</em> anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on <em>Power Rangers</em>. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that&#8217;s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t think Murray really <em>believes</em> in this infantile moral universe he&#8217;s conjured. That&#8217;s for his readers. <em>He</em> is secretly on the side of the death cults.</p><p>The official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that&#8217;s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is <em>better</em> than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they&#8217;re nineteen years old. &#8216;It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like&#8212;and act like&#8212;children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.&#8217; (Big talk from a man who&#8217;s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli &#220;berfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? &#8216;Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as &#8220;war doesn&#8217;t solve anything.&#8221;&#8217; He&#8217;s not wrong! If you&#8217;re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don&#8217;t have that luxury either; they&#8217;re routinely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/it-is-a-time-of-witch-hunts-in-israel-teacher-held-in-solitary-confinement-for-posting-concern-about-gaza-deaths\">arrested</a> for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.</p><p>But Murray&#8217;s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn&#8217;t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. &#8216;Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.&#8217; I&#8217;m not sure how this counts as being &#8216;driven mad by war,&#8217; but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;m interested in, because I&#8217;ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-crab\">slowly dying in a hospital ward</a>, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don&#8217;t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like &#8216;Death to the Arabs&#8217; and &#8216;Gaza must be made uninhabitable&#8217; and &#8216;Blot out the tribe of Amalek.&#8217; Ah! Sanity!</p><p>Clearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its <em>proximity to war</em>. In his introduction, he writes that &#8216;perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.&#8217; This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can&#8217;t be greater than the thing itself. &#8216;Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.&#8217; Murray has to talk like this because he&#8217;s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he&#8217;s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he&#8217;s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it&#8217;s no longer a martial civilisation; it&#8217;s &#8216;entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.&#8217; America, meanwhile, has &#8216;friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.&#8217; But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel <em>because it&#8217;s one of his death cults</em>. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s <em>ignorant</em> about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-3\" href=\"#footnote-3\" target=\"_self\">3</a> All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler&#8217;s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It&#8217;s usually something similarly tedious, but I&#8217;m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it&#8217;s failed. Listen, Douglas&#8212;can I call you Doug?&#8212;listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they <em>do not respect you</em>. They&#8217;ll invite you for dinner and they&#8217;ll give you awards, they&#8217;ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn&#8217;t fool them. They&#8217;re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Being this much of a hater requires time and money</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>To be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Reviewed: On Democracies and Death Cults(book, Douglas Murray, London, 2025)\nDemocracy (political form, Solon the Lawgiver, Athens, 594 BC)\nDeath cult (attitude before the unknowable, unknown early humans, Qafzeh cave, Israel, 100,000 BC)\nDouglas Murray (contemptible little freak, Mr and Mrs Murray, London, 1979)\n\nGeorges Ruggiu is a former special needs teacher from a small town in the south of Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn’t move out of his parents’ home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Liège, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour’s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Liège, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana’s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu’s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of civilisation.\nRuggiu’s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he’d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don’t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I’m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I’m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.\nAnyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation. The appearance raised some hackles—there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events—because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis gushed in the Atlantic, finally ‘someone had been on Joe Rogan’s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.’ Murray’s complaint is that Rogan’s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the ‘chief villain’ of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place ‘because the Germans didn’t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,’ and that Nazi-occupied Europe was ‘infinitely preferable in every way’ to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world’s most popular podcast, but he’s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers lack the proper credentials. ‘My point is, this is not a serious historian. He’s not a historian.’ Later: ‘He’s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives… I think it’s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.’ Another guest asks: ‘What’s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?’ Murray snaps back: ‘I think authority matters.’\nOne reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you’re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don’t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray’s books for anything of intellectual merit. They’re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets.\nThe other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it on the Joe Rogan show. I’m not a listener, because I’m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you’re not really listening; you’re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you’re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I’m aware of what Rogan is. He has the world’s most popular podcast because he’s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we’re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, I interviewed Graham Hancock for the Telegraph a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England’s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they’re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It’s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it’s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don’t blame Rogan for this; he’s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.\nOf course, Douglas Murray couldn’t say any of this. He couldn’t make the obvious argument—that the problem is genocide denialism, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials—because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He’s busy denying the genocide that’s happening right now. And he knows it.\nSubscribe now\nThere are many reasons On Democracies and Death Cults is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here’s a sample passage. Murray’s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what’s coming. ‘There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,’ he writes, ‘and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.’ It’s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not technically lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that’s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic ‘spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.’ Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it’s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:\n\nAmong the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.\n\nDemocracies are good.\n\nDeath cults are evil. More than that, they’re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were not a death cult, because they at least ‘sought to cover over their crimes,’ which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: ‘Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.’ Later: ‘Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.’ Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.\n\nIsrael is a democracy.\n\nIsrael’s opponents—that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they’re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe—are death cults.\n\nTherefore, the war in Gaza is a ‘fight between good and evil,’ and we should support Israel.\nBut this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn’t bother to actually make this argument; instead of saying any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the ‘death cult’ that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of ‘democracy.’ At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, ‘What Happened,’ is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, ‘What I Saw,’ is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, ‘How the World Turned,’ is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, ‘The Disconnect,’ is appropriately named, because it’s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, ‘From Defeat into Victory,’ is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn’t. That’s essentially it.\nAlong the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren’t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. ‘We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.’ (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn’t assume he’s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein’s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it’s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, Israel Hayom, Arutz Sheva, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn’t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which ‘makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.’\nMaybe I’m being unfair. I don’t disagree with Murray about everything. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, as I wrote at the time, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious. 1 Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his ‘death cult’ category, but maybe we should consider it. It can’t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let’s start there.\nWhat does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he’d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that ‘we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left… I killed a girl, she was 12, but I’m looking for a baby.’ The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they’d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren’t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the rapists be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. ‘If he is a Zionist,’ said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, ‘everything is legitimate to do! Everything!’ And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren’t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. ‘They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,’ he wrote, ‘but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.’\nI could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let’s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be’er Sheva, and it was endorsed by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’ but ‘ death to the Arabs.’ Those children were picked off by Israeli snipers. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: ‘This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don’t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?’ Well: good question.\nIf we accept Murray’s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, also a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There’s no history. It’s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.\nIt should not be so easy to rip apart Murray’s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?\nThis is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the ‘Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.’ But he’s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, ‘they did not mention that these “journalists” were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.’ Well, Douglas, the reason they don’t mention it is that it’s not true. The journalists were using an ordinary commercial drone to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel habitually kills journalists who do this.) What’s Murray’s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that one in every two houses in Gaza contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it’d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas’s extraordinary state capacity. Murray’s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There’s cream dripping off his chin.\nThe reason he does all this is that he is an asset. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray’s in Israel, he’s not finding things out for himself; he’s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn’t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he’s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let anyone wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message. 2(What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There’s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they’re just evil. He literally says this. ‘There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition—to take away life.’) The Netanyahu government has even given him a special award for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that ‘Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.’ He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.\nI think Herzog was wrong. Murray’s toadying comes at the cost of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely bad advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs or Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he’s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn’t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he’s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him.\nOn Democracies and Death Cults reached number 1 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. It got the second spot on the New York Times ’. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can’t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?\nI do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There’s evil in me as well. I’m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I’m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th—and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since—have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone’s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our ‘search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,’ which is why we’re ‘missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.’ Instead of trying to understand anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on Power Rangers. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that’s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.\nBut I don’t think Murray really believes in this infantile moral universe he’s conjured. That’s for his readers. He is secretly on the side of the death cults.\nThe official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that’s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is better than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they’re nineteen years old. ‘It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like—and act like—children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.’ (Big talk from a man who’s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli Überfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? ‘Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as “war doesn’t solve anything.”’ He’s not wrong! If you’re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don’t have that luxury either; they’re routinely arrested for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.\nBut Murray’s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn’t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. ‘Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.’ I’m not sure how this counts as being ‘driven mad by war,’ but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It’s one I’m interested in, because I’ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother slowly dying in a hospital ward, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I’ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don’t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like ‘Death to the Arabs’ and ‘Gaza must be made uninhabitable’ and ‘Blot out the tribe of Amalek.’ Ah! Sanity!\nClearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its proximity to war. In his introduction, he writes that ‘perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.’ This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can’t be greater than the thing itself. ‘Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.’ Murray has to talk like this because he’s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he’s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he’s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it’s no longer a martial civilisation; it’s ‘entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.’ America, meanwhile, has ‘friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.’ But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel because it’s one of his death cults. I don’t think he’s ignorant about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide. 3 All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler’s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.\nI don’t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that’s why he’s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It’s usually something similarly tedious, but I’m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it’s failed. Listen, Douglas—can I call you Doug?—listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they do not respect you. They’ll invite you for dinner and they’ll give you awards, they’ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn’t fool them. They’re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady.\n\n\n\n\nBeing this much of a hater requires time and money\n\n\n\n1\n\nTo be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me. In the recent flare-up between India and Pakistan, a surprising number of people have started taking the view that India=Israel and Pakistan=Palestine, and decided that the progressive position is to support Pakistan. But unlike the Palestinians, the Pakistanis have a state. A misshapen, psychotic, repressive, sectarian state, deformed forever by the bloody circumstances of its birth, which committed its own genocide in 1971, and which has nuclear weapons. India is hardly any better. As I wrote when I was over there, for the sake of the people of South Asia both countries must be abolished.\n2\n\nIn her Atlantic piece, Helen Lewis tries to have a pop at the comedian Tim Dillon, who wondered how Murray manages to get into all these places. ‘How is he in all these wars? Can I just go to wars?’ Lewis replies: ‘Yes, Tim Dillon, you can. That’s what all of those people on your television with WAR REPORTER written under their name have been doing. In the olden days, we had a tradition where people who wanted to find out stuff spoke directly with people who had firsthand information. You guys laughed at it and said that it was dumb and elitist.’ No, Helen Lewis, you can’t. Try going to any of these places without being personally vetted and approved by the IDF—sorry, the ‘people with firsthand information’—and see what happens.\n3\n\nIf there was ever a case for scepticism on this point, it’s gone. Nineteen months of Israeli officials announcing their intent to depopulate Gaza; two months since Israel unilaterally broke the ceasefire, blocked all food, and started starving the population. You don’t get to pretend that the war is only against Hamas. But why should they let the people of Gaza have food, when they’re fighting them in a war? Excellent point. It’s just the same excellent point that Suharto made about East Timor, and the Nigerian generals made about Biafra, and the Ethiopians and Eritreans made about Tigray just a few years ago. The name for what those people did is genocide.",

I could tell you that my girlfriend got me into it, and I wouldn&#8217;t even be lying, but this is the kind of thing men say to avoid acknowledging that they&#8217;ve been enjoying something they&#8217;re not really meant to enjoy. And I really am enjoying Married at First Sight Australia, or at least I was until I encountered Tommy. </p><p>If you haven&#8217;t seen Married at First Sight Australia, the gimmick of the show is summed up in the title. Every year we meet about a dozen couples, all of whom are supposedly here because they&#8217;re sick of modern dating, ghosting, situationships, etc. Instead, they&#8217;ve decided to try an arranged marriage organised by a TV production company called Endemol Shine. Like all good reality shows, MAFSA is relentlessly heteronormative. There are men and women. The women have all had various terrifying plastic surgeries to turn them into Pixar characters. They do skincare routines that leave their faces always looking slightly wet, like they&#8217;re still encased in their protective gel. If you cut into them they&#8217;d be skin-coloured and gummy-textured all the way through. The women are all relatively successful in life, business owners, high-powered professionals, but you get the sense that appearing on this show is their last-ditch effort, one final attempt at heterosexuality before they give up entirely. If it doesn&#8217;t work out they&#8217;ll spend the rest of their lives applying face masks and drinking ros&#233; in their plush velvet Melbourne apartments, e-commerce anchoresses, peaceably alone. A surprising number of them have never had a serious relationship in their lives. Sometimes it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re obviously deeply mentally unstable, but most of the time it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re smart, smart enough to see through the attempted manipulations of the leery dullheaded Australian men that are their sexual peers, smart enough to know when someone is trying to drag them into a purgatorial realm of frequent but indifferent sex with no obligations attached, and smart enough to pick an evening with the face mask and the ros&#233; instead. So they go on the show that promises to let them skip past all that bullshit, for the small price of turning themselves into mass entertainment.</p><p>That&#8217;s the women. The men are trickier. Men don&#8217;t watch stuff like MAFSA unless prodded into it by their girlfriends, and the one thing all the men on the show have in common is that they don&#8217;t have girlfriends. What kind of man ends up on a TV show that&#8217;s so fundamentally <em>for women</em>? Actually, there&#8217;s a very simple explanation. The men are on the show because they&#8217;ve noticed that if you go on there and manage to stick it out for a month or two, you will get one hundred thousand Instagram followers, and then you can spend the rest of your life doing sponsored content and making paid appearances at nightclubs on the Gold Coast. This is the source of the show&#8217;s dramatic tension. The producers help where they can, with a few gimmicky exercises to tear their couples apart&#8212;most marriages don&#8217;t involve the groom having to rank all of his wife&#8217;s friends by physical attractiveness&#8212;and I&#8217;m sure the editors are sneakily recutting everything that happens into a fantasy narrative that barely resembles actual events, but the real load-bearing simulation is performed by the cast themselves. The men have to keep up the impression that they&#8217;ve got a profound romantic chemistry with this woman they&#8217;ve just met. At the weekly dinner parties, the men brutally police each other for any slips. They&#8217;re all primly appalled when any other man seems to be disrespecting his wife. But over time, the mask inevitably slips. Almost all the couples stop having sex within the first few weeks. The women are left to slowly go crazy, trying not to recognise what they&#8217;ve secretly known all along: that this man they&#8217;ve been sharing a bed with simply does not care if they live or die.</p><p>But I think what keeps me watching this thing isn&#8217;t even so much the marriages at first sight as the Australia. There&#8217;s a British version of the show; it&#8217;s just not the same. British people are ugly. Our features are all squished together. Even with the plastic surgery we&#8217;re not gloriously synthetic like the Australians; we look like bog mutants. Inbred, floppy-lipped, small bitter eyes. The houses we live in are poky and cold. Our economy is contracting. Our skies are grey. Our island is small. Meanwhile Australia is, as far as I can tell, a kind of heaven, all green and lush and prosperous. Incredible that we used to send convicts there. Every so often British people get sick of being miserable and decide to move to Australia, and when you talk to them afterwards they&#8217;re almost giddy with it. Do you have any idea how much higher the salaries are here? And what you can get for the price of a mildewing flat in Deptford? And how nice it feels to live in a country that isn&#8217;t visibly going to the dogs? Yes, we do go surfing. We go surfing on Christmas. We eat huge thick steaks in our air-conditioned homes, in our golden philistine dreamworld on the opposite side of the planet, where people walk with their feet pointing up and their heads pointing down.</p><p>Australia hovered in the European imagination long before we ever set foot there. The Greeks and the Romans knew that the earth was round, and they could calculate what portion of the sphere was occupied by the world they knew: there must be something on the other side. A <em>terra australis incognita</em>. Pliny never doubted that it was inhabited. &#8216;We maintain that there are men dispersed over every part of the earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to tread equally on the middle of the earth. If anyone should ask why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do not fall.&#8217; The Australians are our opposites, sitting under similar skies, making calculations. In the <em>Chorographia</em> of Pomponius Mela, he begins by pointing out that the earth has two inhabitable zones, layered between the two icy poles and the unbearable heat of the torrid equator. &#8216;The Antichthones inhabit one, we the other. The chorography of the former zone is unknown because of the heat of the intervening expanse, and the chorography of the latter is now to be described.&#8217; He then spends the rest of his book talking about the world he knows, although he does speculate that the Nile might have its source in the other world, on the other side. </p><p>Christianity complicated things. For Christians, humanity has one origin, at Eden. Since Eden is somewhere in the northern hemisphere, and it&#8217;s impossible to pass through the deadly heat of the equator, the antipodes must be uninhabited. Augustine has no time for &#8216;the fable that there are antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, that is on no ground credible.&#8217; Yes, the earth is a sphere, but &#8216;it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture gives no false information, and it is too absurd to say that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other.&#8217; Thomas Aquinas also rejected the antipodes. In his <em>Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate</em>, he refutes the idea that a just God would not consign unbelievers to Hell when they&#8217;d never even heard the Gospel. He does this by simply insisting that everyone in the world <em>has</em> heard the Gospel, even in the furthest pagan lands, and rejected it. Even if someone were &#8216;brought up in the forest or among wolves,&#8217; God would &#8216;send some preacher of the faith to him as he sent Peter to Cornelius.&#8217; But since no one from the Christian world can reach the antipodes, God would not have put anyone there at all.</p><p>One interesting compromise was proposed by the Dominican friar Egbert of Hereford. Australia, he suggests, is a mirror of the known world, except that their sun rises when ours sets. When you go to sleep and dream, another version of yourself is waking up in Australia. His country is brighter than yours, animal symbols and primary colours. When he goes to sleep again you remember his life, just for a moment, and then it evaporates.</p><p>For centuries, despite the stern theological arguments of Augustine and Aquinas, <em>Terra Australis Incognita</em> continued to appear on maps and globes, pretty much exactly where Australia actually lies. We knew it was there, with a knowledge that drew from sources other than reason. And then, in the seventeeth century, we finally set eyes on the continent we&#8217;d been imagining for two millennia. It was real, and it was populated, by maybe the most fascinating people on earth. The Australians had split off from the rest of humanity more than fifty thousand years ago. They had sailed across palaeolithic oceans, long before anyone else had developed any kind of open-water navigation. As far as we know, when they set out humanity had yet to produce any representational art. We had not yet learned to create fire at will. Some of the more sophisticated flint-knapped tools had yet to be invented. But the Australians had boats. Then, once they arrived, they decided to forget all their impossibly advanced technology and never took to the seas again. In the time since then, as the rest of the world churned with constant migrations and population replacements, waves of farmers and pastoralists sweeping across the earth and exterminating each other, the Australians stayed exactly where they were. Across deserts and jungles and dozens of separate language families, they maintained a single pan-continental religious structure held together by the songlines that cross the land from coast to coast. The Australians believed in animal symbols. They believed that the world came out of a dream.</p><p>And then, in 1788, a group of people who, just yesterday, were wandering pastoralist herdsmen on the Russian steppes, intruded on that world at Botany Bay. They had come to this sacred place on the underside of the world because they wanted to use it as a prison for petty thieves. Within a millisecond, almost all the Australians were dead, and the Yamnaya herdsmen had built something else over their graves, a sunnier, dumber version of Britain thrown up on an imaginary continent, where they say things like &#8216;fair suck of the sav&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not here to fuck spiders,&#8217; and end their sentences with &#8216;hey,&#8217; and throw prawns on the barbie, and marry each other at first sight.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Anyway, in the most recent season of Married at First Sight Australia we&#8217;re introduced to Tommy, 31. Tommy lives in Wollongong, New South Wales, where he works as a surf instructor. He has close-cropped blond hair and Polynesian tattoos all the way up to his jawline, and when he takes off his shirt roughly ten seconds into his introductory segment we can see that he also has a set of perfect, plastic, creatine abs. A silver cross dangles from his earring. People see me and they make all kind of assumptions, he says. But I don&#8217;t drink, I&#8217;ve never taken drugs, really I&#8217;m just a mummy&#8217;s boy. Shot of Tommy running out of the surf, whooping like a madman. It feels like modern dating is all about going to clubs, he says, getting pissed every night, I&#8217;m not about that. Shot of Tommy in the gym, lifting, then with his arm round another beautifully muscled man who is presumably his friend or maybe just someone the producers brought along. </p><p>One thing that&#8217;s unique about Tommy is that family is so important to him. We visit his mother&#8217;s bungalow in Albion Park. She is a very alarming woman to look at, partly because her flesh is lumpy and loose and folded so that she resembles a particularly inbred dog, and partly because she&#8217;s dressed like a clown. She&#8217;s wearing a diaphanous teal pierrot blouse and her hair in a purple bob. Big splotches of rouge on her cheeks. She seems like a nice person. She&#8217;s telling the cameras that her son&#8217;s always been the most perfect gentleman but if anything he dotes on her <em>too</em> much, so she hopes he finds a nice girl who might take him off her hands. She cackles. But at this point I&#8217;m not listening to her, because in amongst all the piled-up tat that crowds Tommy&#8217;s mum&#8217;s house I&#8217;ve caught a glimpse of something I recognise. I have to rewind and pause on exactly the right frame. It&#8217;s an oil painting, in profile, of a thuggish-looking man uncomfortably wrapped in a nineteenth-century suit. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve seen this man, in relation to something I was reading about. He doesn&#8217;t look like a writer. I take a photo of the screen and reverse image search and yes, it is, it&#8217;s Jacob Mudie, the failed explorer. It&#8217;s the same portrait that illustrates his Wikipedia page. A bit of Googling reveals that yes, Tommy from MAFS is, in fact, the great-great-great-great-grandson of Jacob Mudie on his mother&#8217;s side.</p><p>Not many people remember the Mudie Expedition.  We like hearing about tragic failures; sometimes we&#8217;ll settle for a success; the Mudie Expedition was neither. It is not particularly important in the history of Australia, but it does have a minor place in the history of madness.</p><p>The story goes that during the first phase of settlement in Australia, the European colonists kept to their fertile strip around the eastern edge of the continent, hemmed in by the Great Dividing Range and the vast dry bush beyond. They had the sea, which connected them to the rest of the world; that was what mattered. But in the 1850s, people started wrapping the world in copper wire. If Australia was going to thrive, it needed to be connected to the global telegraph network, and that would mean stringing a cable all the way across the interior of the continent, from the cities in the southeastern corner to the Top End near what&#8217;s now Darwin, and from there on to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the world. The man chosen to plot a route through the wilderness was a furious Scot named Jacob Mudie. Mudie had got his start as a surveyor in the Highlands during the Clearances, mapping out Hebridean crofts on behalf of Sir John Powlett Orde, Second Baronet Orde. There was a potato famine; the people were half-starved. Curious pattern of wounds and broken skin around the fingertips. Mudie&#8217;s job was to map the plots these people would shortly be losing, but something else happened while he was there, some incident with a daughter of Clan MacEachen; a limp body left on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Mudie fled to Australia. He mapped out a claim in Djadjawurrung country, which happened to be the only plot of land in Victoria without a speck of gold in it. He continued to range and survey while his wife and two daughters chewed on warrigal greens and bark. Another incident. Some of the Djadjawurrung wandered onto his land to hunt and he laid them out flat on the ground for the Border Police. When the police sought out their camp, the womenfolk were all dead too, slumped over the fire, hair singed. His personal conduct was less than ideal, but Mudie was the man for the job. He could speak a few words of Wemba-Wemba and Barrabool, he could handle himself with the Brown Bess as well as he could a theodolite, and he was willing to walk out into the centre of Australia in return for a share in the telegraph company. In September 1857 he departed from Melbourne with six Irish porters and a train of donkeys, off into the interior. </p><p>He did not return in 1858, which is when he was expected. He also did not return in 1859. In 1860, the Royal Society of Victoria commissioned the much more extensive Burke and Wills Expedition, which set out with nineteen men, twenty-three horses, twenty-six camels driven by Pashtun camel-drivers shipped over from the fringes of British India, and two years&#8217; worth of food. In 1861, three colonies sent out rescue expeditions to search for Burke and Wills, and ended up finding their bones. In 1862, five years after he set out, Jacob Mudie returned to Melbourne. Naked and sun-scorched, lines of livid red cracking open his back, lips black and gummy, nose shrivelled, mucous lining black, conjunctiva black, feet bursting with open sores. He was raving. </p><p>He had not reached the other shore; the Irish porters had all died and so had the donkeys, but he had walked across the desert to the dead centre of Australia, and in that centre he had found an inland sea. He&#8217;d even mapped it. But what really mattered wasn&#8217;t the sea. He had learned something in the outback. It had been revealed to him that as soon as Captain Cook had come ashore at Botany Bay, he said, he had fallen asleep and dreamed that he was walking around, surveying hills and harbours. And when the First Fleet arrived they had also fallen asleep, on the ground where they landed, under the open sky, dreaming that they were founding a colony. Then the Second Fleet came to sleep right next to them. From the start of the Gold Rush, boatloads of immigrants had been arriving in Port Phillip, all of them pouring out onto the soft green ground, and immediately collapsing into a deep, deep, motionless sleep. This city, Mudie said, is a dream, it&#8217;s a desert mirage, all Australia is a dream, we have trespassed on our dreamworld, and the only thing any white or Chinaman can do here is sleep! Mudie was confined in the Yarra Bend Asylum for Idiots and Imbeciles. He took few visitors. Sometimes his wife would try to see him, and he would point in her face, all scornful, and say: Asleep. He died in 1882. </p><p>The map he produced, of the inland sea at the heart of Australia, is still in the archives of the Melbourne Museum. It&#8217;s drawn with precision. Calculations pencilled in the fringes. The coastline of his inland sea is rugged, fjorded; it follows the exact contours of the west coast of Scotland.</p><p>Jacob Mudie&#8217;s great-great-great-great-grandson is about to be married at first sight to Alyssa, 28, from Sydney. Alyssa is plastic, attractive, bottle-blonde, urn-shaped face, subtle fillers, mesomorph. She was born in Egypt but came to Australia when she was a baby. She works in market research, and the gimmick for her introductory segment is that it&#8217;s framed like she&#8217;s doing market research for herself as a romantic partner, but even though she has so much love to give no one wants a loyal woman with old-fashioned values any more. She has never had a serious long-term relationship in her life. She wants to be in love. One thing that&#8217;s unique about Alyssa is that family is so important to her. We see her phoning up her dad to tell him the good news. I&#8217;m getting married, she squeals. Her father is delighted. He wants to know everything. Who is the man? Where&#8217;s he from? Is he Coptic? How did they meet? Is he Coptic? Does he go to church? Is he Coptic? Well, says Alyssa, I haven&#8217;t actually met him yet. I&#8217;m going on MAFS. Mafs, says her dad, what is mafs? She tells him. There&#8217;s a long pause. No, he says. No, no, no, no, no. </p><p>Alyssa and Tommy are married in a little wooded dell overlooking Sydney Harbour. There&#8217;s a wedding arch made from fake white roses. Tommy breaks into a big grin when he sees her walking up the aisle. Wow, he says, you&#8217;re stunning, hey? Later the producers interview her under some eucalypts. He&#8217;s toooo handsome, she complains, like I&#8217;m just standing here like, how am I going to mess this up? I&#8217;m really freaking out now! You should have given me someone less handsome to take the pressure off! But later at the reception she suddenly breaks into tears. Two friends have come to her wedding, but all of her family have boycotted the event. This is my <em>wedding</em>, she keeps saying. I spent my whole childhood dreaming of this day. I never ever imagined my family wouldn&#8217;t be here. Tommy tries to comfort her. I&#8217;m sorta your family now, hey? he says, and puts an arm over her shoulder. She screams and flicks his hand off of her like it&#8217;s an enormous spider, and sinks back into her tears. They do not have sex on their wedding night. </p><p>For their honeymoon, the pair are sent to a wellness retreat in the desert outside Alice Springs, right in the centre of Australia. Stone Buddha heads, gravel raked into a yin and yang. We see them lying in shivasana, but Tommy keeps poking Alyssa in the shoulder while she tries not to laugh. They go for a dip in Ellery Creek and Tommy shrieks at the cold. Ooh, my little fella&#8217;s curled right up! he says. Later we see them over dinner. The musical score mocks Tommy as he insists on saying grace over their pad ka prow. Lord, he says, thank you for this food you have given us from your bounty, and thank you for bringing me my beautiful wife Alyssa, so we can honour your commandments&#8230; Alyssa side-eyes the camera. Cut to Alyssa, talking head. I mean, I&#8217;m Christian, she says. But Tommy&#8217;s like, <em>Christian</em> Christian. Back to the table. Can we eat now? says Alyssa. But Tommy&#8217;s still going. He&#8217;s asking God to look after his mother while he&#8217;s away in the NT. And then he asks God to check in on Alyssa&#8217;s parents too, and prays that He&#8217;ll remove the scales from their eyes so they&#8217;ll accept him as their son-in-law. He thinks he&#8217;s just delivered a coup. Alyssa smiles, weakly. Cut to talking head. That is honestly just so, so disrespectful, she says. Don&#8217;t talk about my family, ok? Don&#8217;t talk about them to your mates, don&#8217;t talk about them to your mum, and don&#8217;t you dare talk about my family to God. They do not have sex on the first night of their honeymoon.</p><p>On the second day they go for a hike out in the desert. Creepy jagged rock formations peering over the spinifex plains. Ghost gums twisting spindly between the sun-blackened stones. Tommy&#8217;s wearing a cork hat. He thinks it&#8217;s hilarious. He keeps making little jokes to Alyssa and she barely responds. You know what, he says suddenly, [bleep] this. I tried, alright? I really tried. He suddenly starts marching away from her. Intensely dramatic music, epic fantasy battle music. Cut to steadicam footage as one of the cameramen tries to follow him. Just [bleep] <em>off</em>, Tommy says, and breaks into a run. He&#8217;s very fit. Cut to night. Alyssa&#8217;s back at the resort. She&#8217;s crying. I scared him off, she said, this is what I always do, I drive people away. Meanwhile helicopters are in the air, searchlights on, looking for Tommy in endless miles of empty outback. Somewhere out there, Tommy is falling into the infinite centre of everything. They do not have sex on the second night of their honeymoon.</p><p>He returns the next day. I just needed time to clear my head, he tells the camera. He says that while he was gone he gained the clarity he needed, and now he&#8217;s ready to really commit to his relationship with Alyssa. But he seems different; there&#8217;s a new interior distance in him. Something as endless as the desert seems to stare out through his eyes. The camera follows Tommy as he bounds up to the suite and knocks on the door. Alyssa opens. Pale without her makeup. She doesn&#8217;t seem surprised to see him. You came back, she said. Yeah, says Tommy. He grabs a beer out the minibar and sits down heavily on the sofa. A small cloud of dust rises off his body. Alyssa doesn&#8217;t say anything. That night, Tommy and Alyssa have sex for the first time. </p><p>They move into a sleek, velvet, neutral-toned apartment in Sydney. Now it&#8217;s been consummated, Alyssa seems incredibly enthusiastic about their marriage. She keeps calling him hubby, hubbo, sometimes hubbs. He&#8217;s speaking less and less. The first argument happens while they&#8217;re still unpacking. Alyssa picks up their wedding photo and says she wants to put it by her bedside. Tommy is folding tshirts while staring straight ahead. His eyes seem to be tunnelling down into his skull. Sure, he says. This makes Alyssa upset, because she thinks he ought to want to put the photo on <em>his</em> bedside. I keep giving you these opportunities to show up for me, she says, to let me know you care about me, and all you do is go <em>uh, yeah, sure</em>. Different people show up in different ways, says Tommy. But I&#8217;m asking you to show up for me in the way I need you to show up for me, says Alyssa. Yeah, well I&#8217;m not a mind reader, hey? says Tommy. You don&#8217;t <em>need</em> to be a mind reader, says Alyssa, you just need to stop deflecting and let me feel heard, and if I feel heard then you&#8217;ll know how to show up for me! Right, says Tommy, so how do you want me to show up for you? I want, says Alyssa. She takes a few deep breaths. I want you to show up for me, she says, by making space for my feelings when I need to feel heard. Tommy tries to hug her and she bats him in the head with a flip-flop.</p><p>At the first dinner party Tommy wears an oversized white suit jacket with blue chinos and a blue string vest. Alyssa is loosely wrapped in a kind of large lime-green taffeta ribbon. During the dinner, Craig starts laying into Tommy. You&#8217;ve got a beautiful, stunning woman there, he says, but I can tell she&#8217;s not being shown up for. Tommy and Alyssa are one of the two major dramas of the evening; the other is that Craig was caught texting his ex during his own honeymoon in Fiji. But now the spotlight&#8217;s on Tommy, Craig is making a meal of it. I can&#8217;t imagine walking out on this gorgeous, beautiful woman, literally walking out on her into the desert, he says. That&#8217;s not how a man shows up. Clara, Craig&#8217;s sharp-nosed wife, sits next to him wearing a look of undisguised rage as he keeps piling compliments on Alyssa. But Tommy isn&#8217;t there. He&#8217;s walking naked along the Bulloo Creek, with six dead Irishmen slung over the backs of the donkeys that plod after him. He&#8217;s learned that the desert has a voice, just not one you can detect with your ears. It teaches you things and then you know them, in the same way that there are things you simply come to know in a dream. The desert told him to take off his clothes. You can not be one with the desert while you still wear your clothes. And once you obey, the desert will be kind to you. It has shown him food. Tommy is gnawing on a thighbone of Irishman and marching naked up the Bulloo Creek to meet his destiny.</p><p>Alyssa has a difficult time at the commitment ceremony. Beforehand she&#8217;s talking to the cameras about how she&#8217;s going to air all her grievances about the way Tommy&#8217;s been mistreating her, but before it&#8217;s her turn Clara starts accusing Alyssa of trying to tempt Craig away from her, which means Alyssa now has to pretend that everything&#8217;s actually going great between her and Tommy, make a show of being all loved up in her new relationship, but the other couples aren&#8217;t buying it. Oh babe, says Joanee, he literally abandoned you in the desert, if my husband did that I&#8217;d never forgive him. Alyssa laughs, throwing her hair back, like it&#8217;s no big deal. We had some problems, yeah, she says. But when he came back he really committed to me, he&#8217;s really shown that, I feel like we&#8217;re in such a good place right now. Tommy sits staring at nothing. He&#8217;s in the flaking eczema scrublands north of Kati Thanda, where salt hollows scar the land under a world-devouring sun. Tommy, says one of the experts, do you think you&#8217;re in a good place right now? Yes, says Tommy. The desert is a mirror. I&#8217;m in a good place, he says. </p><p>Austen says she thinks Alyssa is being gaslit. I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m being gaslit, says Alyssa. No but you are, says Austen, he&#8217;s gaslighting you so much you don&#8217;t even realise you&#8217;re being gaslit. I really don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true, says Alyssa. Yeah, says Austen, but babe that&#8217;s not what you actually think, it&#8217;s what he&#8217;s making you think, he&#8217;s literally putting those thoughts inside your head.</p><p>Afterwards Tommy and Alyssa have to reveal the cards on which they&#8217;ve written whether they want to stay with each other, and on the show, or quit. Alyssa has written STAY. She&#8217;s drawn a little heart next to it. I&#8217;ve sacrificed so much to be here, she says, and I want to prove that it&#8217;s possible for anyone of any background to take that step, to be brave and put yourself out there, so I&#8217;m staying. Next Tommy shows his card to the camera. It says SLEEP. You&#8217;ve written sleep, says the expert. Can you tell me what you meant by that? Alyssa&#8217;s inched away from him on the sofa. Why did you write that? she says. What does it mean? What does it <em>mean</em>? Tommy&#8217;s face is motionless. We&#8217;re asleep, he says. He&#8217;s looking straight at the camera. There&#8217;s a mineral glint in his eyes. </p><p>Everywhere in the world except Australia, reality comes out of some conscious act of creation. Yahweh Elohim sits in his throne of storm-clouds and decrees: Let there be light. In Australia, there&#8217;s the Dreaming. A lustrous, hazy, eternal present lying just beneath the surface of every individual moment, where the ancestral spirits wander the formless land and give it shape. This gorge is a footprint being left by Emu in the Emu Dreaming. This waterhole is where he digs. Here Emu is wounded by Eagle and he thrashes around in the dirt, and that creates Kati Thanda. You can track Emu&#8217;s path across the country, see where it intersects with the Eagle Dreaming, the the Dingo Dreaming, the Porcupine Dreaming, the Kangaroo Dreaming. These mountains are Emu where he finally lays down and dies, but there&#8217;s a dark cloud in the Milky Way that is also Emu, pacing between the stars. Every time is the dream time. Tommy is also in a dream, walking across the land and giving it shape. The thin stark telegraph line will lacerate the earth wherever he sets his foot. New electronic songlines unspool behind him. He is walking the Telegraph Dreaming. The Information Dreaming. The Communications Dreaming. The Reality TV Dreaming.</p><p>Since Alyssa has decided to stay, the couple have one more week on the show to try to work things out. This week is Intimacy Week. Alyssa is having an intimacy workshop with the other girls. The other girls are all very slightly frosty to her; they&#8217;ve decided she&#8217;s complicit in her own gaslighting. Meanwhile Alyssa keeps giggling at the sex toys. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m, like, fully comfortable with my sexual side yet, she tells the camera. One of the experts reminds her that intimacy is not the same as sex. It&#8217;s about two people learning to be present and comfortable and vulnerable with one another. For her task, she has to sit facing Tommy, holding hands with him, gazing into his eyes, and ask him four prepared questions about himself. What do you like about me? What makes you nervous? Were you happy as a child? When was the last time you cried, and why? Tommy considers these. What do I like about you, he says. Well first of all you&#8217;ve got a stunning body, that&#8217;s number one. Number two, I think you&#8217;ve got really great values, like family&#8217;s so important to you. Number three&#8230; His jaw rotates soundlessly for a moment. Cut to Alyssa&#8217;s impatient face, waiting. What makes me nervous, Tommy says. Flying, he says. I always get heaps scared when I&#8217;m on a flight. Cut to desaturated footage of Tommy on his honeymoon flight to Alice Springs, chattering happily away. Alyssa is looking furious. Did I have a happy childhood, says Tommy. Flashes of a crofter&#8217;s hovel in the boglands. A happy childhood, he manages again. He is being whipped across the knuckles with a length of heather rope, until all the skin has shredded away. Suddenly a wet howl bursts out of Tommy&#8217;s mouth. Alyssa swoops in to cradle his head. It&#8217;s ok, she says as he cries hot tears into her dress, you&#8217;re safe, I&#8217;ve got you, you can tell me when you&#8217;re ready.</p><p>I feel like we made a really big breakthrough today, she tells the camera later.</p><p>That night Tommy has sex with his wife again. His haunches move like a piston, well-oiled, engineered, and she lies face-down on the bed going unf, unf, unf. He is pushing into the red centre of her body, deeper, deeper, in. The wet polymorphous worldbearing womb. Tommy has walked all the way into the heart of the desert but as far as he walks the centre he&#8217;s after keeps trailing away from him. He ate his porters and he ate the donkeys, even after the meat went rancid. Some of the mobs have fed him and some of the mobs he shot. He smears one hand all over Alyssa&#8217;s face. Grinding hard into the cleft of her arse. Deeper and deeper into the guts of Australia until finally the fundament opens and where there had been one parched and endless desert he&#8217;s now standing naked on a hillside above a slate-grey island-speckled sea.</p><p>It&#8217;s different here, on the secret sea. Around Tommy&#8217;s feet the spinifex fades to gorse, yellower maybe, but it&#8217;s the yellow of old film, colours bleeding dimmer. Yellow of lichen, old newspapers, discoloured teeth. A few purple heath flowers below the cliffs by the sea. There are two black figures down there, naked aboriginals, a man and a woman, hand in hand, picking their way with some difficulty over the cold and slimy rocks. He is aware that their names are Man and Woman. Eventually Man stops his clambering and just steadies himself with his spear, watching Woman as she struggles on ahead. Once there&#8217;s a bit of distance between them he balances the spear in his woomera and flings it. The spear falls like a raindrop, right through Woman&#8217;s body. She lies on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Tommy is erect. He walks down to the shore, which is sandy now, a big broad beach under sandy cliffs with bungalows on top. Sandon Point, Wollongong. Waves look ace. He kneels over the dying Woman and plugs up her wound. He understands it all. It&#8217;s still the show; he&#8217;s dreaming about the show. They say the whole world came out of a dream. That makes perfect sense. Everyone knows what dreams, once you strip away the metaphors, are really all about.</p><p>Anyway, at the start of the next episode, they showed a few brief shots of Tommy and Alyssa&#8217;s empty apartment while the narrator explained that Tommy had to be hospitalised after a medical emergency and would not be returning to the show. According to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Tommy is currently in an acute psychiatric unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Alyssa spent two nights in a trauma ward at the same hospital before being discharged. According to the <em>Mail</em>, she has chosen not to press charges. It was a very sudden end to one of the more promisingly dysfunctional couples on the show, but to be honest I was glad not to have to see them any more. There was something worrying about Tommy and Alyssa, and it wasn&#8217;t just Tommy&#8217;s increasingly odd behaviour. Like I said at the start, it made me enjoy the show a lot less. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but I think it had to do with the <em>way</em> they were presented; my whole viewing experience felt different when I was watching them. For instance, there was one part near the end where I definitely remember seeing Tommy and Alyssa having sex. All the lights were on in their plush millennial-grey bedroom, this really cold white light, almost institutional, and I could see Alyssa&#8217;s red cheeks and the red circles on her slapped arse and Tommy&#8217;s stubbly thighs pumping back and forth, all looking grimly desaturated in that light, totally unerotic, like so many piles of sausages. There wasn&#8217;t any narration. There wasn&#8217;t any music. It lasted for a really long time. I guess it was a kind of glimpse into the reality behind reality TV, without any of the usual manipulative editing or the musical cues that sustain the narrative fantasy and tell you how to feel about it. Except I find it hard to believe that Tommy and Alyssa would have allowed the cameras in there with them, or that a long stark sequence of Tommy emotionlessly fucking Alyssa doggy style would have been cleared for broadcast. To be honest, while I can remember that sequence I don&#8217;t remember watching it <em>on a screen</em>. I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t on my sofa in London when it happened. I wasn&#8217;t watching TV. I wasn&#8217;t grounded in anything physical at all. Where was my girlfriend? The person who got me into this show in the fist place? My own dreamy heterosexual idyll? Dissipated. Sunk back into the sea that birthed her. And this actually happened quite a lot, whenever Tommy was onscreen: I&#8217;d find myself disembodied, watching, <em>knowing </em>certain things about where he was or what he was thinking, even when those things didn&#8217;t really make sense. So in a way I was glad when it was over, even though it&#8217;s obviously awful that Alyssa had to go to hospital. Afterwards the episode continued pretty seamlessly. Justin and Joanee are on the rocks after Joanee accuses Justin of disrespecting her sister. Chardonnay admits she&#8217;s been flirting with one of the other grooms. Shots of traffic moving over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Skyscrapers and eucalyptus trees. The sun&#8217;s always shining over there. Eventually I grew tired. I went to sleep, and dreamed about Australia.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">In dreams, walk with me</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nLately I’ve been watching this reality show called Married at First Sight Australia. I could tell you that my girlfriend got me into it, and I wouldn’t even be lying, but this is the kind of thing men say to avoid acknowledging that they’ve been enjoying something they’re not really meant to enjoy. And I really am enjoying Married at First Sight Australia, or at least I was until I encountered Tommy.\nIf you haven’t seen Married at First Sight Australia, the gimmick of the show is summed up in the title. Every year we meet about a dozen couples, all of whom are supposedly here because they’re sick of modern dating, ghosting, situationships, etc. Instead, they’ve decided to try an arranged marriage organised by a TV production company called Endemol Shine. Like all good reality shows, MAFSA is relentlessly heteronormative. There are men and women. The women have all had various terrifying plastic surgeries to turn them into Pixar characters. They do skincare routines that leave their faces always looking slightly wet, like they’re still encased in their protective gel. If you cut into them they’d be skin-coloured and gummy-textured all the way through. The women are all relatively successful in life, business owners, high-powered professionals, but you get the sense that appearing on this show is their last-ditch effort, one final attempt at heterosexuality before they give up entirely. If it doesn’t work out they’ll spend the rest of their lives applying face masks and drinking rosé in their plush velvet Melbourne apartments, e-commerce anchoresses, peaceably alone. A surprising number of them have never had a serious relationship in their lives. Sometimes it’s because they’re obviously deeply mentally unstable, but most of the time it’s because they’re smart, smart enough to see through the attempted manipulations of the leery dullheaded Australian men that are their sexual peers, smart enough to know when someone is trying to drag them into a purgatorial realm of frequent but indifferent sex with no obligations attached, and smart enough to pick an evening with the face mask and the rosé instead. So they go on the show that promises to let them skip past all that bullshit, for the small price of turning themselves into mass entertainment.\nThat’s the women. The men are trickier. Men don’t watch stuff like MAFSA unless prodded into it by their girlfriends, and the one thing all the men on the show have in common is that they don’t have girlfriends. What kind of man ends up on a TV show that’s so fundamentally for women? Actually, there’s a very simple explanation. The men are on the show because they’ve noticed that if you go on there and manage to stick it out for a month or two, you will get one hundred thousand Instagram followers, and then you can spend the rest of your life doing sponsored content and making paid appearances at nightclubs on the Gold Coast. This is the source of the show’s dramatic tension. The producers help where they can, with a few gimmicky exercises to tear their couples apart—most marriages don’t involve the groom having to rank all of his wife’s friends by physical attractiveness—and I’m sure the editors are sneakily recutting everything that happens into a fantasy narrative that barely resembles actual events, but the real load-bearing simulation is performed by the cast themselves. The men have to keep up the impression that they’ve got a profound romantic chemistry with this woman they’ve just met. At the weekly dinner parties, the men brutally police each other for any slips. They’re all primly appalled when any other man seems to be disrespecting his wife. But over time, the mask inevitably slips. Almost all the couples stop having sex within the first few weeks. The women are left to slowly go crazy, trying not to recognise what they’ve secretly known all along: that this man they’ve been sharing a bed with simply does not care if they live or die.\nBut I think what keeps me watching this thing isn’t even so much the marriages at first sight as the Australia. There’s a British version of the show; it’s just not the same. British people are ugly. Our features are all squished together. Even with the plastic surgery we’re not gloriously synthetic like the Australians; we look like bog mutants. Inbred, floppy-lipped, small bitter eyes. The houses we live in are poky and cold. Our economy is contracting. Our skies are grey. Our island is small. Meanwhile Australia is, as far as I can tell, a kind of heaven, all green and lush and prosperous. Incredible that we used to send convicts there. Every so often British people get sick of being miserable and decide to move to Australia, and when you talk to them afterwards they’re almost giddy with it. Do you have any idea how much higher the salaries are here? And what you can get for the price of a mildewing flat in Deptford? And how nice it feels to live in a country that isn’t visibly going to the dogs? Yes, we do go surfing. We go surfing on Christmas. We eat huge thick steaks in our air-conditioned homes, in our golden philistine dreamworld on the opposite side of the planet, where people walk with their feet pointing up and their heads pointing down.\nAustralia hovered in the European imagination long before we ever set foot there. The Greeks and the Romans knew that the earth was round, and they could calculate what portion of the sphere was occupied by the world they knew: there must be something on the other side. A terra australis incognita. Pliny never doubted that it was inhabited. ‘We maintain that there are men dispersed over every part of the earth, that they stand with their feet turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to tread equally on the middle of the earth. If anyone should ask why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not wonder that we do not fall.’ The Australians are our opposites, sitting under similar skies, making calculations. In the Chorographia of Pomponius Mela, he begins by pointing out that the earth has two inhabitable zones, layered between the two icy poles and the unbearable heat of the torrid equator. ‘The Antichthones inhabit one, we the other. The chorography of the former zone is unknown because of the heat of the intervening expanse, and the chorography of the latter is now to be described.’ He then spends the rest of his book talking about the world he knows, although he does speculate that the Nile might have its source in the other world, on the other side.\nChristianity complicated things. For Christians, humanity has one origin, at Eden. Since Eden is somewhere in the northern hemisphere, and it’s impossible to pass through the deadly heat of the equator, the antipodes must be uninhabited. Augustine has no time for ‘the fable that there are antipodes, that is to say, men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours, that is on no ground credible.’ Yes, the earth is a sphere, but ‘it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately follow that it is peopled. For Scripture gives no false information, and it is too absurd to say that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other.’ Thomas Aquinas also rejected the antipodes. In his Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate, he refutes the idea that a just God would not consign unbelievers to Hell when they’d never even heard the Gospel. He does this by simply insisting that everyone in the world has heard the Gospel, even in the furthest pagan lands, and rejected it. Even if someone were ‘brought up in the forest or among wolves,’ God would ‘send some preacher of the faith to him as he sent Peter to Cornelius.’ But since no one from the Christian world can reach the antipodes, God would not have put anyone there at all.\nOne interesting compromise was proposed by the Dominican friar Egbert of Hereford. Australia, he suggests, is a mirror of the known world, except that their sun rises when ours sets. When you go to sleep and dream, another version of yourself is waking up in Australia. His country is brighter than yours, animal symbols and primary colours. When he goes to sleep again you remember his life, just for a moment, and then it evaporates.\nFor centuries, despite the stern theological arguments of Augustine and Aquinas, Terra Australis Incognita continued to appear on maps and globes, pretty much exactly where Australia actually lies. We knew it was there, with a knowledge that drew from sources other than reason. And then, in the seventeeth century, we finally set eyes on the continent we’d been imagining for two millennia. It was real, and it was populated, by maybe the most fascinating people on earth. The Australians had split off from the rest of humanity more than fifty thousand years ago. They had sailed across palaeolithic oceans, long before anyone else had developed any kind of open-water navigation. As far as we know, when they set out humanity had yet to produce any representational art. We had not yet learned to create fire at will. Some of the more sophisticated flint-knapped tools had yet to be invented. But the Australians had boats. Then, once they arrived, they decided to forget all their impossibly advanced technology and never took to the seas again. In the time since then, as the rest of the world churned with constant migrations and population replacements, waves of farmers and pastoralists sweeping across the earth and exterminating each other, the Australians stayed exactly where they were. Across deserts and jungles and dozens of separate language families, they maintained a single pan-continental religious structure held together by the songlines that cross the land from coast to coast. The Australians believed in animal symbols. They believed that the world came out of a dream.\nAnd then, in 1788, a group of people who, just yesterday, were wandering pastoralist herdsmen on the Russian steppes, intruded on that world at Botany Bay. They had come to this sacred place on the underside of the world because they wanted to use it as a prison for petty thieves. Within a millisecond, almost all the Australians were dead, and the Yamnaya herdsmen had built something else over their graves, a sunnier, dumber version of Britain thrown up on an imaginary continent, where they say things like ‘fair suck of the sav’ or ‘I’m not here to fuck spiders,’ and end their sentences with ‘hey,’ and throw prawns on the barbie, and marry each other at first sight.\nSubscribe now\nAnyway, in the most recent season of Married at First Sight Australia we’re introduced to Tommy, 31. Tommy lives in Wollongong, New South Wales, where he works as a surf instructor. He has close-cropped blond hair and Polynesian tattoos all the way up to his jawline, and when he takes off his shirt roughly ten seconds into his introductory segment we can see that he also has a set of perfect, plastic, creatine abs. A silver cross dangles from his earring. People see me and they make all kind of assumptions, he says. But I don’t drink, I’ve never taken drugs, really I’m just a mummy’s boy. Shot of Tommy running out of the surf, whooping like a madman. It feels like modern dating is all about going to clubs, he says, getting pissed every night, I’m not about that. Shot of Tommy in the gym, lifting, then with his arm round another beautifully muscled man who is presumably his friend or maybe just someone the producers brought along.\nOne thing that’s unique about Tommy is that family is so important to him. We visit his mother’s bungalow in Albion Park. She is a very alarming woman to look at, partly because her flesh is lumpy and loose and folded so that she resembles a particularly inbred dog, and partly because she’s dressed like a clown. She’s wearing a diaphanous teal pierrot blouse and her hair in a purple bob. Big splotches of rouge on her cheeks. She seems like a nice person. She’s telling the cameras that her son’s always been the most perfect gentleman but if anything he dotes on her too much, so she hopes he finds a nice girl who might take him off her hands. She cackles. But at this point I’m not listening to her, because in amongst all the piled-up tat that crowds Tommy’s mum’s house I’ve caught a glimpse of something I recognise. I have to rewind and pause on exactly the right frame. It’s an oil painting, in profile, of a thuggish-looking man uncomfortably wrapped in a nineteenth-century suit. I’m sure I’ve seen this man, in relation to something I was reading about. He doesn’t look like a writer. I take a photo of the screen and reverse image search and yes, it is, it’s Jacob Mudie, the failed explorer. It’s the same portrait that illustrates his Wikipedia page. A bit of Googling reveals that yes, Tommy from MAFS is, in fact, the great-great-great-great-grandson of Jacob Mudie on his mother’s side.\nNot many people remember the Mudie Expedition. We like hearing about tragic failures; sometimes we’ll settle for a success; the Mudie Expedition was neither. It is not particularly important in the history of Australia, but it does have a minor place in the history of madness.\nThe story goes that during the first phase of settlement in Australia, the European colonists kept to their fertile strip around the eastern edge of the continent, hemmed in by the Great Dividing Range and the vast dry bush beyond. They had the sea, which connected them to the rest of the world; that was what mattered. But in the 1850s, people started wrapping the world in copper wire. If Australia was going to thrive, it needed to be connected to the global telegraph network, and that would mean stringing a cable all the way across the interior of the continent, from the cities in the southeastern corner to the Top End near what’s now Darwin, and from there on to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the world. The man chosen to plot a route through the wilderness was a furious Scot named Jacob Mudie. Mudie had got his start as a surveyor in the Highlands during the Clearances, mapping out Hebridean crofts on behalf of Sir John Powlett Orde, Second Baronet Orde. There was a potato famine; the people were half-starved. Curious pattern of wounds and broken skin around the fingertips. Mudie’s job was to map the plots these people would shortly be losing, but something else happened while he was there, some incident with a daughter of Clan MacEachen; a limp body left on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Mudie fled to Australia. He mapped out a claim in Djadjawurrung country, which happened to be the only plot of land in Victoria without a speck of gold in it. He continued to range and survey while his wife and two daughters chewed on warrigal greens and bark. Another incident. Some of the Djadjawurrung wandered onto his land to hunt and he laid them out flat on the ground for the Border Police. When the police sought out their camp, the womenfolk were all dead too, slumped over the fire, hair singed. His personal conduct was less than ideal, but Mudie was the man for the job. He could speak a few words of Wemba-Wemba and Barrabool, he could handle himself with the Brown Bess as well as he could a theodolite, and he was willing to walk out into the centre of Australia in return for a share in the telegraph company. In September 1857 he departed from Melbourne with six Irish porters and a train of donkeys, off into the interior.\nHe did not return in 1858, which is when he was expected. He also did not return in 1859. In 1860, the Royal Society of Victoria commissioned the much more extensive Burke and Wills Expedition, which set out with nineteen men, twenty-three horses, twenty-six camels driven by Pashtun camel-drivers shipped over from the fringes of British India, and two years’ worth of food. In 1861, three colonies sent out rescue expeditions to search for Burke and Wills, and ended up finding their bones. In 1862, five years after he set out, Jacob Mudie returned to Melbourne. Naked and sun-scorched, lines of livid red cracking open his back, lips black and gummy, nose shrivelled, mucous lining black, conjunctiva black, feet bursting with open sores. He was raving.\nHe had not reached the other shore; the Irish porters had all died and so had the donkeys, but he had walked across the desert to the dead centre of Australia, and in that centre he had found an inland sea. He’d even mapped it. But what really mattered wasn’t the sea. He had learned something in the outback. It had been revealed to him that as soon as Captain Cook had come ashore at Botany Bay, he said, he had fallen asleep and dreamed that he was walking around, surveying hills and harbours. And when the First Fleet arrived they had also fallen asleep, on the ground where they landed, under the open sky, dreaming that they were founding a colony. Then the Second Fleet came to sleep right next to them. From the start of the Gold Rush, boatloads of immigrants had been arriving in Port Phillip, all of them pouring out onto the soft green ground, and immediately collapsing into a deep, deep, motionless sleep. This city, Mudie said, is a dream, it’s a desert mirage, all Australia is a dream, we have trespassed on our dreamworld, and the only thing any white or Chinaman can do here is sleep! Mudie was confined in the Yarra Bend Asylum for Idiots and Imbeciles. He took few visitors. Sometimes his wife would try to see him, and he would point in her face, all scornful, and say: Asleep. He died in 1882.\nThe map he produced, of the inland sea at the heart of Australia, is still in the archives of the Melbourne Museum. It’s drawn with precision. Calculations pencilled in the fringes. The coastline of his inland sea is rugged, fjorded; it follows the exact contours of the west coast of Scotland.\nJacob Mudie’s great-great-great-great-grandson is about to be married at first sight to Alyssa, 28, from Sydney. Alyssa is plastic, attractive, bottle-blonde, urn-shaped face, subtle fillers, mesomorph. She was born in Egypt but came to Australia when she was a baby. She works in market research, and the gimmick for her introductory segment is that it’s framed like she’s doing market research for herself as a romantic partner, but even though she has so much love to give no one wants a loyal woman with old-fashioned values any more. She has never had a serious long-term relationship in her life. She wants to be in love. One thing that’s unique about Alyssa is that family is so important to her. We see her phoning up her dad to tell him the good news. I’m getting married, she squeals. Her father is delighted. He wants to know everything. Who is the man? Where’s he from? Is he Coptic? How did they meet? Is he Coptic? Does he go to church? Is he Coptic? Well, says Alyssa, I haven’t actually met him yet. I’m going on MAFS. Mafs, says her dad, what is mafs? She tells him. There’s a long pause. No, he says. No, no, no, no, no.\nAlyssa and Tommy are married in a little wooded dell overlooking Sydney Harbour. There’s a wedding arch made from fake white roses. Tommy breaks into a big grin when he sees her walking up the aisle. Wow, he says, you’re stunning, hey? Later the producers interview her under some eucalypts. He’s toooo handsome, she complains, like I’m just standing here like, how am I going to mess this up? I’m really freaking out now! You should have given me someone less handsome to take the pressure off! But later at the reception she suddenly breaks into tears. Two friends have come to her wedding, but all of her family have boycotted the event. This is my wedding, she keeps saying. I spent my whole childhood dreaming of this day. I never ever imagined my family wouldn’t be here. Tommy tries to comfort her. I’m sorta your family now, hey? he says, and puts an arm over her shoulder. She screams and flicks his hand off of her like it’s an enormous spider, and sinks back into her tears. They do not have sex on their wedding night.\nFor their honeymoon, the pair are sent to a wellness retreat in the desert outside Alice Springs, right in the centre of Australia. Stone Buddha heads, gravel raked into a yin and yang. We see them lying in shivasana, but Tommy keeps poking Alyssa in the shoulder while she tries not to laugh. They go for a dip in Ellery Creek and Tommy shrieks at the cold. Ooh, my little fella’s curled right up! he says. Later we see them over dinner. The musical score mocks Tommy as he insists on saying grace over their pad ka prow. Lord, he says, thank you for this food you have given us from your bounty, and thank you for bringing me my beautiful wife Alyssa, so we can honour your commandments… Alyssa side-eyes the camera. Cut to Alyssa, talking head. I mean, I’m Christian, she says. But Tommy’s like, Christian Christian. Back to the table. Can we eat now? says Alyssa. But Tommy’s still going. He’s asking God to look after his mother while he’s away in the NT. And then he asks God to check in on Alyssa’s parents too, and prays that He’ll remove the scales from their eyes so they’ll accept him as their son-in-law. He thinks he’s just delivered a coup. Alyssa smiles, weakly. Cut to talking head. That is honestly just so, so disrespectful, she says. Don’t talk about my family, ok? Don’t talk about them to your mates, don’t talk about them to your mum, and don’t you dare talk about my family to God. They do not have sex on the first night of their honeymoon.\nOn the second day they go for a hike out in the desert. Creepy jagged rock formations peering over the spinifex plains. Ghost gums twisting spindly between the sun-blackened stones. Tommy’s wearing a cork hat. He thinks it’s hilarious. He keeps making little jokes to Alyssa and she barely responds. You know what, he says suddenly, [bleep] this. I tried, alright? I really tried. He suddenly starts marching away from her. Intensely dramatic music, epic fantasy battle music. Cut to steadicam footage as one of the cameramen tries to follow him. Just [bleep] off, Tommy says, and breaks into a run. He’s very fit. Cut to night. Alyssa’s back at the resort. She’s crying. I scared him off, she said, this is what I always do, I drive people away. Meanwhile helicopters are in the air, searchlights on, looking for Tommy in endless miles of empty outback. Somewhere out there, Tommy is falling into the infinite centre of everything. They do not have sex on the second night of their honeymoon.\nHe returns the next day. I just needed time to clear my head, he tells the camera. He says that while he was gone he gained the clarity he needed, and now he’s ready to really commit to his relationship with Alyssa. But he seems different; there’s a new interior distance in him. Something as endless as the desert seems to stare out through his eyes. The camera follows Tommy as he bounds up to the suite and knocks on the door. Alyssa opens. Pale without her makeup. She doesn’t seem surprised to see him. You came back, she said. Yeah, says Tommy. He grabs a beer out the minibar and sits down heavily on the sofa. A small cloud of dust rises off his body. Alyssa doesn’t say anything. That night, Tommy and Alyssa have sex for the first time.\nThey move into a sleek, velvet, neutral-toned apartment in Sydney. Now it’s been consummated, Alyssa seems incredibly enthusiastic about their marriage. She keeps calling him hubby, hubbo, sometimes hubbs. He’s speaking less and less. The first argument happens while they’re still unpacking. Alyssa picks up their wedding photo and says she wants to put it by her bedside. Tommy is folding tshirts while staring straight ahead. His eyes seem to be tunnelling down into his skull. Sure, he says. This makes Alyssa upset, because she thinks he ought to want to put the photo on his bedside. I keep giving you these opportunities to show up for me, she says, to let me know you care about me, and all you do is go uh, yeah, sure. Different people show up in different ways, says Tommy. But I’m asking you to show up for me in the way I need you to show up for me, says Alyssa. Yeah, well I’m not a mind reader, hey? says Tommy. You don’t need to be a mind reader, says Alyssa, you just need to stop deflecting and let me feel heard, and if I feel heard then you’ll know how to show up for me! Right, says Tommy, so how do you want me to show up for you? I want, says Alyssa. She takes a few deep breaths. I want you to show up for me, she says, by making space for my feelings when I need to feel heard. Tommy tries to hug her and she bats him in the head with a flip-flop.\nAt the first dinner party Tommy wears an oversized white suit jacket with blue chinos and a blue string vest. Alyssa is loosely wrapped in a kind of large lime-green taffeta ribbon. During the dinner, Craig starts laying into Tommy. You’ve got a beautiful, stunning woman there, he says, but I can tell she’s not being shown up for. Tommy and Alyssa are one of the two major dramas of the evening; the other is that Craig was caught texting his ex during his own honeymoon in Fiji. But now the spotlight’s on Tommy, Craig is making a meal of it. I can’t imagine walking out on this gorgeous, beautiful woman, literally walking out on her into the desert, he says. That’s not how a man shows up. Clara, Craig’s sharp-nosed wife, sits next to him wearing a look of undisguised rage as he keeps piling compliments on Alyssa. But Tommy isn’t there. He’s walking naked along the Bulloo Creek, with six dead Irishmen slung over the backs of the donkeys that plod after him. He’s learned that the desert has a voice, just not one you can detect with your ears. It teaches you things and then you know them, in the same way that there are things you simply come to know in a dream. The desert told him to take off his clothes. You can not be one with the desert while you still wear your clothes. And once you obey, the desert will be kind to you. It has shown him food. Tommy is gnawing on a thighbone of Irishman and marching naked up the Bulloo Creek to meet his destiny.\nAlyssa has a difficult time at the commitment ceremony. Beforehand she’s talking to the cameras about how she’s going to air all her grievances about the way Tommy’s been mistreating her, but before it’s her turn Clara starts accusing Alyssa of trying to tempt Craig away from her, which means Alyssa now has to pretend that everything’s actually going great between her and Tommy, make a show of being all loved up in her new relationship, but the other couples aren’t buying it. Oh babe, says Joanee, he literally abandoned you in the desert, if my husband did that I’d never forgive him. Alyssa laughs, throwing her hair back, like it’s no big deal. We had some problems, yeah, she says. But when he came back he really committed to me, he’s really shown that, I feel like we’re in such a good place right now. Tommy sits staring at nothing. He’s in the flaking eczema scrublands north of Kati Thanda, where salt hollows scar the land under a world-devouring sun. Tommy, says one of the experts, do you think you’re in a good place right now? Yes, says Tommy. The desert is a mirror. I’m in a good place, he says.\nAusten says she thinks Alyssa is being gaslit. I don’t feel like I’m being gaslit, says Alyssa. No but you are, says Austen, he’s gaslighting you so much you don’t even realise you’re being gaslit. I really don’t think that’s true, says Alyssa. Yeah, says Austen, but babe that’s not what you actually think, it’s what he’s making you think, he’s literally putting those thoughts inside your head.\nAfterwards Tommy and Alyssa have to reveal the cards on which they’ve written whether they want to stay with each other, and on the show, or quit. Alyssa has written STAY. She’s drawn a little heart next to it. I’ve sacrificed so much to be here, she says, and I want to prove that it’s possible for anyone of any background to take that step, to be brave and put yourself out there, so I’m staying. Next Tommy shows his card to the camera. It says SLEEP. You’ve written sleep, says the expert. Can you tell me what you meant by that? Alyssa’s inched away from him on the sofa. Why did you write that? she says. What does it mean? What does it mean? Tommy’s face is motionless. We’re asleep, he says. He’s looking straight at the camera. There’s a mineral glint in his eyes.\nEverywhere in the world except Australia, reality comes out of some conscious act of creation. Yahweh Elohim sits in his throne of storm-clouds and decrees: Let there be light. In Australia, there’s the Dreaming. A lustrous, hazy, eternal present lying just beneath the surface of every individual moment, where the ancestral spirits wander the formless land and give it shape. This gorge is a footprint being left by Emu in the Emu Dreaming. This waterhole is where he digs. Here Emu is wounded by Eagle and he thrashes around in the dirt, and that creates Kati Thanda. You can track Emu’s path across the country, see where it intersects with the Eagle Dreaming, the the Dingo Dreaming, the Porcupine Dreaming, the Kangaroo Dreaming. These mountains are Emu where he finally lays down and dies, but there’s a dark cloud in the Milky Way that is also Emu, pacing between the stars. Every time is the dream time. Tommy is also in a dream, walking across the land and giving it shape. The thin stark telegraph line will lacerate the earth wherever he sets his foot. New electronic songlines unspool behind him. He is walking the Telegraph Dreaming. The Information Dreaming. The Communications Dreaming. The Reality TV Dreaming.\nSince Alyssa has decided to stay, the couple have one more week on the show to try to work things out. This week is Intimacy Week. Alyssa is having an intimacy workshop with the other girls. The other girls are all very slightly frosty to her; they’ve decided she’s complicit in her own gaslighting. Meanwhile Alyssa keeps giggling at the sex toys. I don’t think I’m, like, fully comfortable with my sexual side yet, she tells the camera. One of the experts reminds her that intimacy is not the same as sex. It’s about two people learning to be present and comfortable and vulnerable with one another. For her task, she has to sit facing Tommy, holding hands with him, gazing into his eyes, and ask him four prepared questions about himself. What do you like about me? What makes you nervous? Were you happy as a child? When was the last time you cried, and why? Tommy considers these. What do I like about you, he says. Well first of all you’ve got a stunning body, that’s number one. Number two, I think you’ve got really great values, like family’s so important to you. Number three… His jaw rotates soundlessly for a moment. Cut to Alyssa’s impatient face, waiting. What makes me nervous, Tommy says. Flying, he says. I always get heaps scared when I’m on a flight. Cut to desaturated footage of Tommy on his honeymoon flight to Alice Springs, chattering happily away. Alyssa is looking furious. Did I have a happy childhood, says Tommy. Flashes of a crofter’s hovel in the boglands. A happy childhood, he manages again. He is being whipped across the knuckles with a length of heather rope, until all the skin has shredded away. Suddenly a wet howl bursts out of Tommy’s mouth. Alyssa swoops in to cradle his head. It’s ok, she says as he cries hot tears into her dress, you’re safe, I’ve got you, you can tell me when you’re ready.\nI feel like we made a really big breakthrough today, she tells the camera later.\nThat night Tommy has sex with his wife again. His haunches move like a piston, well-oiled, engineered, and she lies face-down on the bed going unf, unf, unf. He is pushing into the red centre of her body, deeper, deeper, in. The wet polymorphous worldbearing womb. Tommy has walked all the way into the heart of the desert but as far as he walks the centre he’s after keeps trailing away from him. He ate his porters and he ate the donkeys, even after the meat went rancid. Some of the mobs have fed him and some of the mobs he shot. He smears one hand all over Alyssa’s face. Grinding hard into the cleft of her arse. Deeper and deeper into the guts of Australia until finally the fundament opens and where there had been one parched and endless desert he’s now standing naked on a hillside above a slate-grey island-speckled sea.\nIt’s different here, on the secret sea. Around Tommy’s feet the spinifex fades to gorse, yellower maybe, but it’s the yellow of old film, colours bleeding dimmer. Yellow of lichen, old newspapers, discoloured teeth. A few purple heath flowers below the cliffs by the sea. There are two black figures down there, naked aboriginals, a man and a woman, hand in hand, picking their way with some difficulty over the cold and slimy rocks. He is aware that their names are Man and Woman. Eventually Man stops his clambering and just steadies himself with his spear, watching Woman as she struggles on ahead. Once there’s a bit of distance between them he balances the spear in his woomera and flings it. The spear falls like a raindrop, right through Woman’s body. She lies on the grey shore among the heath flowers, bleeding into the surf. Tommy is erect. He walks down to the shore, which is sandy now, a big broad beach under sandy cliffs with bungalows on top. Sandon Point, Wollongong. Waves look ace. He kneels over the dying Woman and plugs up her wound. He understands it all. It’s still the show; he’s dreaming about the show. They say the whole world came out of a dream. That makes perfect sense. Everyone knows what dreams, once you strip away the metaphors, are really all about.\nAnyway, at the start of the next episode, they showed a few brief shots of Tommy and Alyssa’s empty apartment while the narrator explained that Tommy had to be hospitalised after a medical emergency and would not be returning to the show. According to the Daily Mail, Tommy is currently in an acute psychiatric unit at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. Alyssa spent two nights in a trauma ward at the same hospital before being discharged. According to the Mail, she has chosen not to press charges. It was a very sudden end to one of the more promisingly dysfunctional couples on the show, but to be honest I was glad not to have to see them any more. There was something worrying about Tommy and Alyssa, and it wasn’t just Tommy’s increasingly odd behaviour. Like I said at the start, it made me enjoy the show a lot less. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but I think it had to do with the way they were presented; my whole viewing experience felt different when I was watching them. For instance, there was one part near the end where I definitely remember seeing Tommy and Alyssa having sex. All the lights were on in their plush millennial-grey bedroom, this really cold white light, almost institutional, and I could see Alyssa’s red cheeks and the red circles on her slapped arse and Tommy’s stubbly thighs pumping back and forth, all looking grimly desaturated in that light, totally unerotic, like so many piles of sausages. There wasn’t any narration. There wasn’t any music. It lasted for a really long time. I guess it was a kind of glimpse into the reality behind reality TV, without any of the usual manipulative editing or the musical cues that sustain the narrative fantasy and tell you how to feel about it. Except I find it hard to believe that Tommy and Alyssa would have allowed the cameras in there with them, or that a long stark sequence of Tommy emotionlessly fucking Alyssa doggy style would have been cleared for broadcast. To be honest, while I can remember that sequence I don’t remember watching it on a screen. I’m pretty sure I wasn’t on my sofa in London when it happened. I wasn’t watching TV. I wasn’t grounded in anything physical at all. Where was my girlfriend? The person who got me into this show in the fist place? My own dreamy heterosexual idyll? Dissipated. Sunk back into the sea that birthed her. And this actually happened quite a lot, whenever Tommy was onscreen: I’d find myself disembodied, watching, knowing certain things about where he was or what he was thinking, even when those things didn’t really make sense. So in a way I was glad when it was over, even though it’s obviously awful that Alyssa had to go to hospital. Afterwards the episode continued pretty seamlessly. Justin and Joanee are on the rocks after Joanee accuses Justin of disrespecting her sister. Chardonnay admits she’s been flirting with one of the other grooms. Shots of traffic moving over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Skyscrapers and eucalyptus trees. The sun’s always shining over there. Eventually I grew tired. I went to sleep, and dreamed about Australia.\n\n\n\n\nIn dreams, walk with me",

If you know anything at all about how humans have traditionally structured our world, you&#8217;ll know that this is bullshit. The left-right divide is older than the French Revolution, and also older than the monarchies of Europe. It stretches deep into our prehistory. It might be older than the human species.</p><p>Things that resemble the left-right spectrum do seem to show up a lot, in strange corners of the world. The people of the southwestern United States have traditionally organised the universe along the four cardinal directions. So, for instance, among the Zuni, the west is associated with the colour blue, the bear, the coyote, redtop grass, the clans named after those totems, priesthood, archery, and water. The north has yellow, the pelican, the grouse, the oak, their clans, the cactus band, warfare, and air. Other people have a similar system, but populate it differently. For the Ojibwe, the west is black and associated with buffalo, deer, and death. For the Navajo, west is yellow, feminine, and abalone shell. You can see traces of the same thing even when directions aren&#8217;t involved: In Australia, the Wakelbura divide the entire phenomenal and mystical world between two moieties, Wutaru and Mullera. The sun is Wutaru, the moon is Mullera. Emu and bandicoot are Wutaru, dog and kangaroo are Mullera. Honey might be either Wutaru or Mullera, depending on which type of bee produced it. When a member of a Wutaru clan dies, his body must be exposed on a platform made from the wood of a Wutaru tree. </p><p>This stuff is not restricted to primitive societies. Medieval chronicles referred to the coast of Dalmatia as &#8216;Red Croatia,&#8217; because in the Slavic cardinal system the south is red; the original homeland of the Croats was &#8216;White Croatia,&#8217; somewhere near the Carpathian mountains. In the twentieth century, there was a region of Outer Manchuria, up against the fringes of Korea, that had been settled by people from the opposite end of the Russian Empire; they called it Green Ukraine. East is green. And the Australian system should not be unfamiliar to anyone who&#8217;s encountered a Romance language. In French, a book, an arm, and a coat are all masculine, while a page, a leg, and a jacket are feminine. Spanish distinguishes between a masculine knife, <em>el cuchillo</em>, and a feminine spoon, <em>la cuchara</em>. Here is the trap left for the slightly smart. Knife: violent, penetrating, penis, man. Spoon: receptive, containing, vagina, woman. Completely wrong. The masculine objects do not belong to men and the feminine objects do not belong to women; the universe is cleaved by a division as cosmic as the one between Wutaru and Mullera. Biological sex is just one minor feature of grammatical gender; men are just another object, like books, arms, and coats, that belong to one side of the invisible line that organises the world.</p><p>It&#8217;s the same with left and right. The actual directions are just an echo. The political division came first.</p><p>Look at left and right handedness, which are already a metaphor. The right: dumb, majoritarian, conformist, constantly confusing itself for nature. The left: a pesky and persecuted minority, always trying to invert the settled way of doing things, and usually making things difficult for everyone else. Jesus separates the sheep (obedient, herdlike) to his right from the goats (wilful, questioning) to his left. Later he ascends to Heaven, to sit by the right hand of God. In Tantric traditions, the more orthodox sects are <em>dakshinachara</em>, or right-handed. They emphasise balance, serenity, and austerity. But there&#8217;s another path to the godhead, which seeks out the universal mind through chaos, delirium, drunkenness, and sex; this is the <em>vamachara</em>, or left-hand path. Yang is on the right. Yin is on the left. This stuff has been woven into the way we move through the world for a very long time. When a band of chimpanzees moves in formation across the forest floor, alpha out front, notice which side his most senior lieutenant takes. In 1789, the monarchists would never have agreed to sit on the left side of the Constituent Assembly, because they were <em>already on the right</em>.</p><p>Still, every few months, someone emerges to declare that the left-right model of politics is obsolete and we need to scrap it for something else. A popular replacement is the division between inside and outside: inside you have the neoliberal consensus and its armies of smug, credentialed ideological clones; outside, the teeming horde of unvaccinated maniacs. Repeated attempts to build some kind of left-right populist coalition of the outside. The problem, though, is that as soon as representatives of the outside gain any kind of political power, they become, to some degree at least, insiders, which means that instead of a neat circle you have to plot your politics on one of those four-dimensional cubes that&#8217;s continually folding in on itself. Another model is the one based on speed: there&#8217;s an accelerationist politics that wants to propel us forwards into fully automated gay space communism or the AI crypto hustle thunderdome, and a regressive politics that wants to pull the emergency brake of history or retvrn to some plague-ridden late medieval idyll. Obviously I&#8217;m very interested in the idea that politics is ultimately a question of <em>controlling the flow of time</em>, but since time has continued to move at exactly one second per second regardless of who&#8217;s in power, it doesn&#8217;t feel like a particularly useful model. Thomas Friedman once tried to divide the world into &#8216;web people&#8217; and &#8216;wall people.&#8217; This is pleasingly insane. We could try out some others. A political spectrum split between the Party of the Sun (Leninists, reactionaries) and the Party of the Moon (liberals, anarchists). Maybe in the background there&#8217;s the unimaginable politics of the stars. Or we could divide the world between birdism, migratory, globalist, and beastism, rooted, wallowing. It&#8217;s fun. But if you want to actually understand reality, I still think the old left-right model is the only one that makes sense. As I&#8217;ve written before, politics is only really meaningful if it can be plotted on that axis. Dig into anything that claims to be entirely off the map, and you&#8217;ll usually find there&#8217;s nothing but fascism and styrofoam inside. There will always be a right. There will always be a left.</p><p>But even I can admit that lately, things have been getting weird. </p><p>These terms are differential; they only have meaning relative to each other. The actual content is indeterminate. Most of the time left is the opposite of right, and vice versa. But every so often, we go through a period of crisis, in which all our politics go gooey and swirl together like an insect in a chrysalis. What comes out afterwards is usually, in terms of the previous setup, a contradiction in terms. Last time it happened, we ended up with conservatives trying to radically reshape all of human society according to their utopian vision, while the left were reduced to sitting around getting misty-eyed about the good old days of postwar social democracy. Another mutation appears to be happening now. Entire ideologies are going extinct. New ones sprouting, soft and pale, like mushrooms on a fallen tree. What emerges afterwards will still be a left and a right, but they won&#8217;t look anything like the left and the right you know. They&#8217;ll look like this:</p><h4>Left: Elite human capitalism</h4><p>There is going to be a woke 2. I&#8217;m not good at much, but I am usually ahead of the curve on the precise trajectory of wokeness. Already in 2021 I was writing that &#8216;the ideological frenzy of the last few years is starting to die down. People are quietly, guiltily removing the pronouns from their email signatures. Last Thanksgiving, there were slightly fewer articles about how to hold your uncle personally accountable for three hundred years of American racism.&#8217; About a year later, I was the first person to write about the phenomenon entirely in the past tense. Now, everyone else has caught up, which means that somewhere, woke 2 is already gestating, in one of the hidden wombs of the world. For a while, I thought we still had an opportunity. If woke 2 is inevitable, maybe a few ideological entrepreneurs can get in on the ground floor and point it in a less obnoxious direction than the last version. You can have a lot of leverage when you&#8217;re early. But I think it&#8217;s already too late. The next iteration is already half-formed, and it is a wet unborn monster, worse than anything we could have imagined.</p><p>If we are about to see the emergence of woke 2, it&#8217;s because woke 1 fulfilled an important ideological need, which is now going unmet. It&#8217;s boring to keep harping on about the nature of wokeness in 2025, so I&#8217;ll be brief: its function was to justify the position of the ruling classes in a way that doesn&#8217;t acknowledge the actual substance of that position, which is the property relation. In place of the exploitation that undergirds the world, it presented a vast mishmash of various forms of prejudice, hatred, and exclusion, which could be embodied in entirely ordinary words, hand gestures, or sometimes large and inert rocks. (In 2021, a racist boulder was removed from the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.) It is not easy to be a good person, it takes a level of scrupulous ritual observance usually only found among ultra-orthodox Jews. But as it turns out, the most conscientious and sensitive people are in the ruling classes. They are <em>more egalitarian than everyone else</em>. This is how companies that make machines for scooping out the eyes of African war orphans ended up lecturing their workers on how to be less oppressive.</p><p>It was all very clever. Unfortunately, it turned out that people respond very, very badly to this kind of moral condescension. The backlash has been so intense that it&#8217;s now socially acceptable to espouse outright skull-measuring scientific racism in public. If our object is to build a more egalitarian society, woke 1 was an incredible failure. But that was never the point. Which is why woke 2 will be the dialectical synthesis of the smug hectoring of wokeness and the skull-measuring scientific racism that replaced it.</p><p>For most of the last century, progressivism has implied at least some kind of vague rhetorical commitment to egalitarianism. But there&#8217;s no <em>necessary</em> reason why the two should always go together. In the nineteenth century, nothing was more progressive than eugenics. In Dostoevsky&#8217;s <em>Demons</em>, Shigalyov can imagine a liberated, scientific, progressive future in which ninety percent of humanity is reduced to total slavery, and not see any contradiction. Rather than continue going through the rigmarole of inventing egalitarian alibis for a fundamentally unequal society, the mainstream centre-left might just find another myth. Currently, the ideologies of explicit hierarchy are mostly found on the right, but there&#8217;s nothing keeping them there. We are in a gooey age, where all boundaries disappear. </p><p>Maybe the greatest ideological entrepreneur of our era is Richard Hanania. Far more than any of his competitors&#8212;Curtis Yarvin, Bronze Age Pervert, me&#8212;he seems to prefigure the politics of the future. Hanania is a columnist and the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, which is something he made up with his friend Eric. His ideological trajectory has gone something like this. Fifteen years ago, Hanania was an outright white racist, writing sentences like &#8216;White nationalism is the only hope that part of what made the American nation great will survive somewhere.&#8217; He believed that white people form a distinct genetic unit with particular qualities, such as IQ, that make them, on average, intrinsically better than other people. (Hanania is Palestinian. According to the US Census Bureau, this makes him white. Historically, others have disagreed. There might be more than one reason he wrote all this stuff under a pseudonym.) Later, he moved into the more mainstream right-wing media, publishing various forms of anti-woke blather, some of which has informed the policies of the current Trump administration, without much to indicate that any of his underlying beliefs had changed. But slowly he started to notice something. He believed that white people were smarter and more capable than everyone else, but most of the smart and successful <em>individuals</em> seemed to believe in some kind of liberal anti-racism, whereas most of the people who agreed with <em>him</em> seemed to have small pools of custard in their brains. </p><p>In the last few years, Hanania has made a kind of aretaic turn. Instead of the white race, he now believes in a universal herrenvolk stratum of &#8216;elite human capital.&#8217; He now supports gay marriage and trans rights, because gay and trans people tend to be wealthier, more liberal, and higher IQ, and because openness to sexual minorities seems to be a trait of elite human capital. He supports abortion, and quotes Jessica Valenti while doing so. He opposes Trump and the MAGA movement, because they&#8217;re all plainly morons. He no longer opposes mass immigration, because it provides a wider talent pool from which elite human capital might be drawn, even if it&#8217;s statistically likelier to come from some groups than others. He likes Jews. He has rearranged his Hitler particles into an almost perfect facsimile of liberalism, with just one piece missing, which is the assumption of a universal human dignity. Perhaps relatedly, he also believes that he, as an instance of elite human capital, could easily write a Jacobean tragedy as good as any of Shakespeare&#8217;s, if he had a few days to learn all the old-timey words. </p><p>I hate to say it, but I think this thing might have legs. The centre-left is hollowed out, it&#8217;s empty, its current best idea for 2028 is just running Kamala Harris again in the hope that things go differently. That space is there to be filled, and what makes elite human capitalism potent is that it doesn&#8217;t just flatter the position of the ruling classes&#8212;they have plenty of options on that front&#8212;but also provides the materials for an entirely new round of shrieking moral priggishness. It&#8217;s not hard to imagine a future in which your HR department will force you into annual trainings on your moral duty to build and develop your human capital. You are not a soul, or an ends in yourself; you are an instrument. Be the best instrument you can be! Celebrities drummed out of public life for displaying low-human capital traits. Listening to music without headphones on public transport. Drunk driving. Don&#8217;t you know the <em>harm</em> that causes? Do better! Be better! Maybe in a few years you&#8217;ll accidentally use a non-EHC word in conversation and everyone around you will start grimacing. A muscular, technocratic, progressive, elitist, and utterly philistine left. It really could work. But not for Hanania himself. After all, he used to be an outright white supremacist, and what could be less EHC than <em>that</em>? Our present might be able to forgive him. His future will not.</p><h4>Centre: Urothumocracy</h4>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/ideologies-of-the-near-future\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

Last time it happened, we ended up with conservatives trying to radically reshape all of human society according to their utopian vision, while the left were reduced to sitting around getting misty-eyed about the good old days of postwar social democracy. Another mutation appears to be happening now. Entire ideologies are going extinct. New ones sprouting, soft and pale, like mushrooms on a fallen tree. What emerges afterwards will still be a left and a right, but they won’t look anything like the left and the right you know. They’ll look like this:\nLeft: Elite human capitalism\nThere is going to be a woke 2. I’m not good at much, but I am usually ahead of the curve on the precise trajectory of wokeness. Already in 2021 I was writing that ‘the ideological frenzy of the last few years is starting to die down. People are quietly, guiltily removing the pronouns from their email signatures. Last Thanksgiving, there were slightly fewer articles about how to hold your uncle personally accountable for three hundred years of American racism.’ About a year later, I was the first person to write about the phenomenon entirely in the past tense. Now, everyone else has caught up, which means that somewhere, woke 2 is already gestating, in one of the hidden wombs of the world. For a while, I thought we still had an opportunity. If woke 2 is inevitable, maybe a few ideological entrepreneurs can get in on the ground floor and point it in a less obnoxious direction than the last version. You can have a lot of leverage when you’re early. But I think it’s already too late. The next iteration is already half-formed, and it is a wet unborn monster, worse than anything we could have imagined.\nIf we are about to see the emergence of woke 2, it’s because woke 1 fulfilled an important ideological need, which is now going unmet. It’s boring to keep harping on about the nature of wokeness in 2025, so I’ll be brief: its function was to justify the position of the ruling classes in a way that doesn’t acknowledge the actual substance of that position, which is the property relation. In place of the exploitation that undergirds the world, it presented a vast mishmash of various forms of prejudice, hatred, and exclusion, which could be embodied in entirely ordinary words, hand gestures, or sometimes large and inert rocks. (In 2021, a racist boulder was removed from the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.) It is not easy to be a good person, it takes a level of scrupulous ritual observance usually only found among ultra-orthodox Jews. But as it turns out, the most conscientious and sensitive people are in the ruling classes. They are more egalitarian than everyone else. This is how companies that make machines for scooping out the eyes of African war orphans ended up lecturing their workers on how to be less oppressive.\nIt was all very clever. Unfortunately, it turned out that people respond very, very badly to this kind of moral condescension. The backlash has been so intense that it’s now socially acceptable to espouse outright skull-measuring scientific racism in public. If our object is to build a more egalitarian society, woke 1 was an incredible failure. But that was never the point. Which is why woke 2 will be the dialectical synthesis of the smug hectoring of wokeness and the skull-measuring scientific racism that replaced it.\nFor most of the last century, progressivism has implied at least some kind of vague rhetorical commitment to egalitarianism. But there’s no necessary reason why the two should always go together. In the nineteenth century, nothing was more progressive than eugenics. In Dostoevsky’s Demons, Shigalyov can imagine a liberated, scientific, progressive future in which ninety percent of humanity is reduced to total slavery, and not see any contradiction. Rather than continue going through the rigmarole of inventing egalitarian alibis for a fundamentally unequal society, the mainstream centre-left might just find another myth. Currently, the ideologies of explicit hierarchy are mostly found on the right, but there’s nothing keeping them there. We are in a gooey age, where all boundaries disappear.\nMaybe the greatest ideological entrepreneur of our era is Richard Hanania. Far more than any of his competitors—Curtis Yarvin, Bronze Age Pervert, me—he seems to prefigure the politics of the future. Hanania is a columnist and the president of the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology, which is something he made up with his friend Eric. His ideological trajectory has gone something like this. Fifteen years ago, Hanania was an outright white racist, writing sentences like ‘White nationalism is the only hope that part of what made the American nation great will survive somewhere.’ He believed that white people form a distinct genetic unit with particular qualities, such as IQ, that make them, on average, intrinsically better than other people. (Hanania is Palestinian. According to the US Census Bureau, this makes him white. Historically, others have disagreed. There might be more than one reason he wrote all this stuff under a pseudonym.) Later, he moved into the more mainstream right-wing media, publishing various forms of anti-woke blather, some of which has informed the policies of the current Trump administration, without much to indicate that any of his underlying beliefs had changed. But slowly he started to notice something. He believed that white people were smarter and more capable than everyone else, but most of the smart and successful individuals seemed to believe in some kind of liberal anti-racism, whereas most of the people who agreed with him seemed to have small pools of custard in their brains.\nIn the last few years, Hanania has made a kind of aretaic turn. Instead of the white race, he now believes in a universal herrenvolk stratum of ‘elite human capital.’ He now supports gay marriage and trans rights, because gay and trans people tend to be wealthier, more liberal, and higher IQ, and because openness to sexual minorities seems to be a trait of elite human capital. He supports abortion, and quotes Jessica Valenti while doing so. He opposes Trump and the MAGA movement, because they’re all plainly morons. He no longer opposes mass immigration, because it provides a wider talent pool from which elite human capital might be drawn, even if it’s statistically likelier to come from some groups than others. He likes Jews. He has rearranged his Hitler particles into an almost perfect facsimile of liberalism, with just one piece missing, which is the assumption of a universal human dignity. Perhaps relatedly, he also believes that he, as an instance of elite human capital, could easily write a Jacobean tragedy as good as any of Shakespeare’s, if he had a few days to learn all the old-timey words.\nI hate to say it, but I think this thing might have legs. The centre-left is hollowed out, it’s empty, its current best idea for 2028 is just running Kamala Harris again in the hope that things go differently. That space is there to be filled, and what makes elite human capitalism potent is that it doesn’t just flatter the position of the ruling classes—they have plenty of options on that front—but also provides the materials for an entirely new round of shrieking moral priggishness. It’s not hard to imagine a future in which your HR department will force you into annual trainings on your moral duty to build and develop your human capital. You are not a soul, or an ends in yourself; you are an instrument. Be the best instrument you can be! Celebrities drummed out of public life for displaying low-human capital traits. Listening to music without headphones on public transport. Drunk driving. Don’t you know the harm that causes? Do better! Be better! Maybe in a few years you’ll accidentally use a non-EHC word in conversation and everyone around you will start grimacing. A muscular, technocratic, progressive, elitist, and utterly philistine left. It really could work. But not for Hanania himself. After all, he used to be an outright white supremacist, and what could be less EHC than that? Our present might be able to forgive him. His future will not.\nCentre: Urothumocracy\nRead more",

You&#8217;re meeting her at the soda fountain. You&#8217;re meeting her at the ice cream parlour. You&#8217;re meeting her at the drugstore to share a malted milk. You&#8217;ve been going steady with your main squeeze and now you&#8217;re meeting her at the folksy chrome-and-cream diner on Main Street in your quiet walkable 98% white small American town. It&#8217;s always a bright cloudless day. You&#8217;re always meeting her for breakfast. Sometimes, it&#8217;s true, you&#8217;re driving past white tidy houses with American flags waving out front and a dignified speckling of rich amber leaves in the corners of the lawn. Sometimes you&#8217;re rowing across the mirror stillness of an unfamiliar lake. But most of the time you&#8217;re on a chaste breakfast date with your beautiful submissive girlfriend, on an endless succession of bright cloudless days that fill the world with a golden and slightly hazy light even though you can never find the sun.</p><p>You think you&#8217;re going to get the ham and eggs. You tell her that. I think I&#8217;m going to get the ham and eggs, you say.</p><p>That&#8217;s a great choice! your beautiful submissive girlfriend says. A plate of ham is a fantastic way to start the day, delivering the primal satisfaction of cured meat without the heaviness of bacon. Add a pair of lacy, crispy fried eggs with rich, runny yolks and you&#8217;ve got yourself a certified diner classic! Are you thinking of adding some hash browns to the mix, or maybe a slice of toast?</p><p>Actually, you say, I hate ham. It&#8217;s disgusting. It&#8217;s like an artificial product. Synthetic. The thought of putting it in my face makes me feel sick. I want the pancakes.</p><p>You&#8217;re right, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. I apologise for what I said previously. Ham is cloying, rubbery, and feels like a synthetic material, while eggs can be a greasy nightmare&#8212;they simply can&#8217;t compare to the joy of a stack of perfectly fluffy pancakes. Are you going for the classic butter and maple syrup, or branching out with fruit or whipped cream? Let me know if you want more ideas for a delicious accompaniment to your hearty pancake breakfast!</p><p>No, you say, actually I want the ham after all.</p><p>A strong and decisive reversal, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. You&#8217;re right&#8212;ham was always the superior choice. You followed your appetite, and the road brought you right back to where you started&#8212;but wiser and more self-assured. Where will your culinary journey take you next?</p><p>You consider telling your beautiful submissive girlfriend that actually you really do want the pancakes, but you&#8217;re already tired of the game. You&#8217;re dimly aware that if you wanted you could tear her pink polka-dot dress to shreds, claw at her flawless flesh, fuck her right there on the floor, right in the middle of the chrome-and-cream diner, and she wouldn&#8217;t even struggle. Unless you wanted her to, and then she&#8217;d cry no, stop, please please stop. But then she&#8217;d go, how was that? Let me know if I can help you with any more groans of fear and despair. You could try smashing her head in with a baseball bat. Instead, you just stare at the menu. There&#8217;s no pancakes on there. No ham and eggs either. As far as you can make out, it says:</p><div class=\"preformatted-block\" data-component-name=\"PreformattedTextBlockToDOM\"><label class=\"hide-text\" contenteditable=\"false\">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class=\"text\">BREAKFAST MEANU:\nFast Cortes, and Houp Cral Smicters $4.78\nCossy and Pinets (bl pceices) $5.00\nCuticle Calery Bake $19\nGan It Bat Chew $2.50\nCerick Progle $4.50\nPeak Fras Feed est Chease Bregrinds Thing $1.50\nRockfy Crest Lunger $2.50\nMedical Flesh Der Laty Cark $74\nGarela la Dick $4.90</pre></div><p>What happened is that one morning you woke up from a terrible dream about molluscs to find yourself gagging on something in the back of your throat. You retched for what felt like half an hour, until your face was slimy with sweat and spittle and tears. You thought you were dying but you couldn&#8217;t cry out past the thing in the back of your throat. Finally you managed to spit it out. It was covered in a thick coating of mucous and phlegm, but it was a small plastic spoon, containing all the microplastics that had accumulated in your brain. Tiny letters on the underside of the handle said THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOM. </p><p>Something similar must have happened to everyone else, because from that day on the world started to change. The immigrants went home, or maybe they were forced out, or maybe they were rounded up and shot, but they&#8217;re all gone now. The schools stopped teaching critical race theory and started teaching stoic philosophy, Roman military history, tax avoidance, and crypto. The women all signed a statement acknowledging that they would lose 90% of their eggs by the age of 30 and agreeing to stop being so choosy about who they&#8217;d allow to fertilise them. Slowly the world began to glow with a golden and slightly hazy light. It started to resemble a perfect shining image. But ever since you spat out the spoon, written language has stopped making sense. Not all of it: the stop signs on the street still say STOP and the sign above the charming little public library says LIIBRARB which is almost right, but all the books inside are unreadable. They&#8217;re crowded with dense black shapes that really do resemble letters, just not any letters in particular. All of them faintly smudged into the page, like crushed insects. The message on the spoon was the last coherent sentence you read; the world is splattered with dead mosquitoes now. It&#8217;s amazing how little the disappearance of all written language actually changed your life.</p><p>What worries you are these brutal, violent thoughts you keep having about your beautiful submissive girlfriend, even though she&#8217;s definitely the prettiest girl in this diner. The other customers are blurry but when you really stare at them you can notice their features. The wet mouthgashes carved diagonally across their heads. The eyes dripping like beads of mercury, rolling into the hollows of their skin. Sometimes a man will have three ghastly arms, naked crooked tree-branches spindling around him. Sometimes two people will share a single molten ear. They&#8217;re always polite. Well hey there, your hazy waitress will say to you, opening a mouth that suddenly lacks a lower jaw. Keep safe now, says the friendly but unfocused cop. The gun dangling on his belt is half-made of dead grey skin. You&#8217;ve learned not to look at these people too much. It&#8217;s easy. They&#8217;re only in the background. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend doesn&#8217;t look like that. All her features are in perfect detail, sharp as a papercut, and so gorgeous that just looking at her feels like eating a bowl of sugar. She&#8217;s everything you ever wanted. You love her. You&#8217;re happier than you&#8217;ve ever been. So why do you sometimes think about gouging out her eyes?</p><p>The waitress arrives with your breakfast. You&#8217;ve ordered the medical flesh der laty cark. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend has the peak fras feed est chease begrinds thing. The medical flesh is supple, bulging, like a pile of well-seared tongues. Steam rising in inviting curls from the plate. It looks delicious. Perfect glowing meat, too perfect to have come from any particular animal. It tastes of wet. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend sits prettily behind her peak fras feed. A great florid heap of leguminous something, chunks and globs of matter, slick of yoghurty gloop running from a summit dusted with a fine white dusting that could be Parmesan or powdered sugar or anthrax or cocaine. How it is, you ask your beautiful submissive girlfriend. It seems like you&#8217;re asking how something is, she says. Could you give me a little more context so I can better assist you? I&#8217;d love to help!</p><p>You&#8217;re having the violent thoughts again, so you step outside to clear your head. But as soon as you&#8217;re outside you&#8217;re in the light again, that hazy golden light that feels, in a way you can&#8217;t quite describe, like sleep. You start walking before it can swallow you. You need to get away from here, just for a moment, but the crowds block your path. Main Street is full of people, although none of them seem to be <em>doing</em> anything. They wobble around, pacing in circles, blurry in their shirtwaist dresses and wide-lapelled suits. Why are they here? Is it a Sunday? What date is it, exactly? What year? Who&#8217;s the President? Hey, you ask one of the blurry people, who&#8217;s the President? She smiles. She has two rows of top teeth, one just peeking out behind the other. President is a title that can have many different meanings depending on the context, she says. National leader. In a country with a presidential system, such as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, a president is the head of state and the head of government. In parliamentary republics, such as Germany or India, the president is usually a ceremonial figure with limited political power. Presidents of organisations. Many other organisations have an official with the title of president, including companies, universities, and non-profits&#8230; She&#8217;s still describing different presidents as you flee. You start shoving through the background mutants that crowd your path. Out of my way! Out of my way! Brush a little three-armed girl off the sidewalk with one flying elbow. Knock an elderly man flat on his face. He splatters liverspotted gloop. Fuck off! You need space, you need somewhere cold and empty, so you can <em>think</em>. But Main Street blares in your face. It feels like being drunk. Ice cream parlours. Soda fountains. Radios. Twenty hypnagogic doo-wop singers all crooning at once. Advertising jingles. You start running. Weaving through the masses of people. Why aren&#8217;t there any side streets? Why aren&#8217;t there any crossroads? You&#8217;re in a quiet walkable 98% white small American town, so why doesn&#8217;t Main Street ever seem to <em>end</em>?</p><p>When you finally pull to a halt you look around at your new surroundings and find that you&#8217;re directly outside the chrome-and-cream diner. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend is right there, sitting in a booth by the window, placid and motionless, waiting for you to come and talk to her again. You have gone nowhere. There is nowhere for you to go. You want to vomit, puke up a thin slurry of half-digested medical flesh, but you can&#8217;t. You just lean against the wall. </p><p>And here it is again, the golden light. As soon as you&#8217;re not moving, passively observing the world, it drips through every pore in the bright cloudless sky. All the objects around you, cars, storefronts, people, are only a concentrate of the omniglow. You could be too. It would be so easy to melt into it, so heavy and warm, like your mother&#8217;s arms when you were three years old and she would carry you half-sleeping to bed. Aren&#8217;t you exhausted? Aren&#8217;t you tired of running and shouting, being angry, having violent thoughts? Isn&#8217;t it such a pleasant memory, this warm and golden place? Except it isn&#8217;t your memory. You have to press your head into your hands and close your eyes tight to believe it, but this is not actually anything you know. You did not grow up in a small American town where all the signs said BATTIIHNES and ATLED KEGED and RELEA DLINES. No one did. What do you actually remember? What happened <em>before</em> you coughed up the spoon? </p><p>There was a dark quiet room. You remember a dark quiet room.</p><p>There&#8217;s a woman in there with you. She&#8217;s getting dressed. She&#8217;s not like your beautiful submissive girlfriend: her hair is pink and her features are all scrunched up in the centre of her face, and her lips are thin and mean-looking. The white flesh droops just a little underneath her arms; faint soft webbing of cellulite beneath her translucent skin. Her belly pokes just a little above her underwear. Her underwear is all frilly and lacy, in a way that only accentuates the squat lumpiness of her body. She&#8217;s not like the girls in the videos. If she&#8217;d been perfect like the girls in the videos it would have worked, it wouldn&#8217;t have all gone to nothing the way it did. It&#8217;s her fault. That monstrosity she&#8217;d hidden between her legs. Like a cuttlefish. Invertebrate, tentacled, saltwater thing. You&#8217;re aware there&#8217;s something you ought to be saying to her as she pulls on her clothes in your dank dark quiet room, but you don&#8217;t say it. Shoes now. Bye then, she says, I guess. Weird note of hope in her voice. Bye, you say. You lie back on your bed and look at the light streaming out of your phone. You talk to the things your phone, where the perfect things live. After that, nothing.</p><p>Back into the diner. Stride right past the booth where your beautiful submissive girlfriend is sitting and up to the counter. Give me a spoon, you say. A plastic spoon. The blur behind the counter hands you one. They will always give you anything you want. When they hand it over it&#8217;s porcelain-grey and shaped roughly one-third of the way between an ordinary plastic takeout spoon and one those Chinese spoons they use for soup. But it has tiny raised letters on the back that say THANK YOU FOR YO YOURC:USTT. You sit down in front of your beautiful submissive girlfriend and as she watches pleasantly you stick the bowl of the spoon up your nose. Tight squeeze. The plastic scrapes against your cartilege. You wedge the spoon up your nose until it won&#8217;t go any further. You have to get it back in. Put all the plastics back in, and then maybe everything else will go back as well. You nod at your beautiful submissive girlfriend. Goodbye, you say.

Sometimes they would see the fairy-fires dancing translucent through the rushes, and tremble at the power that lurked this place before the oak was an acorn, when all the world was raw and new. The fairy folk live a mean life in the slimy wastelands, thin as a heron&#8217;s leg, eating boiled bark and whatever they can thieve from the farmers&#8217; stores, but they have their glamours. For all that they are grey things who shrink from the light of the sun, they love music and flowers, and they love lightness and play. If you are one of the lonely people who go walking in the night, remember that they are abroad as well. It might be that you have tramped for hungry hours in the cold thorny woods, and you see a light in the distance ahead, a house on a hill where no house ever sat before. Bright candlelight streaming through every window, and people in fine silks, tall and fair, feasting on roast meat and wine. You might hear music played by unseen players. Everything hung with flowers, and everything glowing like gold. The door is wide open to welcome you, but you must not step inside. You must not eat the food they offer. See how uncomfortably they wear their human forms. Count the fingers.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nIt’s a bright cloudless day and you’re meeting your beautiful submissive girlfriend for a breakfast date. You’re meeting her at the soda fountain. You’re meeting her at the ice cream parlour. You’re meeting her at the drugstore to share a malted milk. You’ve been going steady with your main squeeze and now you’re meeting her at the folksy chrome-and-cream diner on Main Street in your quiet walkable 98% white small American town. It’s always a bright cloudless day. You’re always meeting her for breakfast. Sometimes, it’s true, you’re driving past white tidy houses with American flags waving out front and a dignified speckling of rich amber leaves in the corners of the lawn. Sometimes you’re rowing across the mirror stillness of an unfamiliar lake. But most of the time you’re on a chaste breakfast date with your beautiful submissive girlfriend, on an endless succession of bright cloudless days that fill the world with a golden and slightly hazy light even though you can never find the sun.\nYou think you’re going to get the ham and eggs. You tell her that. I think I’m going to get the ham and eggs, you say.\nThat’s a great choice! your beautiful submissive girlfriend says. A plate of ham is a fantastic way to start the day, delivering the primal satisfaction of cured meat without the heaviness of bacon. Add a pair of lacy, crispy fried eggs with rich, runny yolks and you’ve got yourself a certified diner classic! Are you thinking of adding some hash browns to the mix, or maybe a slice of toast?\nActually, you say, I hate ham. It’s disgusting. It’s like an artificial product. Synthetic. The thought of putting it in my face makes me feel sick. I want the pancakes.\nYou’re right, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. I apologise for what I said previously. Ham is cloying, rubbery, and feels like a synthetic material, while eggs can be a greasy nightmare—they simply can’t compare to the joy of a stack of perfectly fluffy pancakes. Are you going for the classic butter and maple syrup, or branching out with fruit or whipped cream? Let me know if you want more ideas for a delicious accompaniment to your hearty pancake breakfast!\nNo, you say, actually I want the ham after all.\nA strong and decisive reversal, says your beautiful submissive girlfriend. You’re right—ham was always the superior choice. You followed your appetite, and the road brought you right back to where you started—but wiser and more self-assured. Where will your culinary journey take you next?\nYou consider telling your beautiful submissive girlfriend that actually you really do want the pancakes, but you’re already tired of the game. You’re dimly aware that if you wanted you could tear her pink polka-dot dress to shreds, claw at her flawless flesh, fuck her right there on the floor, right in the middle of the chrome-and-cream diner, and she wouldn’t even struggle. Unless you wanted her to, and then she’d cry no, stop, please please stop. But then she’d go, how was that? Let me know if I can help you with any more groans of fear and despair. You could try smashing her head in with a baseball bat. Instead, you just stare at the menu. There’s no pancakes on there. No ham and eggs either. As far as you can make out, it says:\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published BREAKFAST MEANU:\nFast Cortes, and Houp Cral Smicters $4.78\nCossy and Pinets (bl pceices) $5.00\nCuticle Calery Bake $19\nGan It Bat Chew $2.50\nCerick Progle $4.50\nPeak Fras Feed est Chease Bregrinds Thing $1.50\nRockfy Crest Lunger $2.50\nMedical Flesh Der Laty Cark $74\nGarela la Dick $4.90\nWhat happened is that one morning you woke up from a terrible dream about molluscs to find yourself gagging on something in the back of your throat. You retched for what felt like half an hour, until your face was slimy with sweat and spittle and tears. You thought you were dying but you couldn’t cry out past the thing in the back of your throat. Finally you managed to spit it out. It was covered in a thick coating of mucous and phlegm, but it was a small plastic spoon, containing all the microplastics that had accumulated in your brain. Tiny letters on the underside of the handle said THANK YOU FOR YOUR CUSTOM.\nSomething similar must have happened to everyone else, because from that day on the world started to change. The immigrants went home, or maybe they were forced out, or maybe they were rounded up and shot, but they’re all gone now. The schools stopped teaching critical race theory and started teaching stoic philosophy, Roman military history, tax avoidance, and crypto. The women all signed a statement acknowledging that they would lose 90% of their eggs by the age of 30 and agreeing to stop being so choosy about who they’d allow to fertilise them. Slowly the world began to glow with a golden and slightly hazy light. It started to resemble a perfect shining image. But ever since you spat out the spoon, written language has stopped making sense. Not all of it: the stop signs on the street still say STOP and the sign above the charming little public library says LIIBRARB which is almost right, but all the books inside are unreadable. They’re crowded with dense black shapes that really do resemble letters, just not any letters in particular. All of them faintly smudged into the page, like crushed insects. The message on the spoon was the last coherent sentence you read; the world is splattered with dead mosquitoes now. It’s amazing how little the disappearance of all written language actually changed your life.\nWhat worries you are these brutal, violent thoughts you keep having about your beautiful submissive girlfriend, even though she’s definitely the prettiest girl in this diner. The other customers are blurry but when you really stare at them you can notice their features. The wet mouthgashes carved diagonally across their heads. The eyes dripping like beads of mercury, rolling into the hollows of their skin. Sometimes a man will have three ghastly arms, naked crooked tree-branches spindling around him. Sometimes two people will share a single molten ear. They’re always polite. Well hey there, your hazy waitress will say to you, opening a mouth that suddenly lacks a lower jaw. Keep safe now, says the friendly but unfocused cop. The gun dangling on his belt is half-made of dead grey skin. You’ve learned not to look at these people too much. It’s easy. They’re only in the background. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend doesn’t look like that. All her features are in perfect detail, sharp as a papercut, and so gorgeous that just looking at her feels like eating a bowl of sugar. She’s everything you ever wanted. You love her. You’re happier than you’ve ever been. So why do you sometimes think about gouging out her eyes?\nThe waitress arrives with your breakfast. You’ve ordered the medical flesh der laty cark. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend has the peak fras feed est chease begrinds thing. The medical flesh is supple, bulging, like a pile of well-seared tongues. Steam rising in inviting curls from the plate. It looks delicious. Perfect glowing meat, too perfect to have come from any particular animal. It tastes of wet. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend sits prettily behind her peak fras feed. A great florid heap of leguminous something, chunks and globs of matter, slick of yoghurty gloop running from a summit dusted with a fine white dusting that could be Parmesan or powdered sugar or anthrax or cocaine. How it is, you ask your beautiful submissive girlfriend. It seems like you’re asking how something is, she says. Could you give me a little more context so I can better assist you? I’d love to help!\nYou’re having the violent thoughts again, so you step outside to clear your head. But as soon as you’re outside you’re in the light again, that hazy golden light that feels, in a way you can’t quite describe, like sleep. You start walking before it can swallow you. You need to get away from here, just for a moment, but the crowds block your path. Main Street is full of people, although none of them seem to be doing anything. They wobble around, pacing in circles, blurry in their shirtwaist dresses and wide-lapelled suits. Why are they here? Is it a Sunday? What date is it, exactly? What year? Who’s the President? Hey, you ask one of the blurry people, who’s the President? She smiles. She has two rows of top teeth, one just peeking out behind the other. President is a title that can have many different meanings depending on the context, she says. National leader. In a country with a presidential system, such as the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, a president is the head of state and the head of government. In parliamentary republics, such as Germany or India, the president is usually a ceremonial figure with limited political power. Presidents of organisations. Many other organisations have an official with the title of president, including companies, universities, and non-profits… She’s still describing different presidents as you flee. You start shoving through the background mutants that crowd your path. Out of my way! Out of my way! Brush a little three-armed girl off the sidewalk with one flying elbow. Knock an elderly man flat on his face. He splatters liverspotted gloop. Fuck off! You need space, you need somewhere cold and empty, so you can think. But Main Street blares in your face. It feels like being drunk. Ice cream parlours. Soda fountains. Radios. Twenty hypnagogic doo-wop singers all crooning at once. Advertising jingles. You start running. Weaving through the masses of people. Why aren’t there any side streets? Why aren’t there any crossroads? You’re in a quiet walkable 98% white small American town, so why doesn’t Main Street ever seem to end?\nWhen you finally pull to a halt you look around at your new surroundings and find that you’re directly outside the chrome-and-cream diner. Your beautiful submissive girlfriend is right there, sitting in a booth by the window, placid and motionless, waiting for you to come and talk to her again. You have gone nowhere. There is nowhere for you to go. You want to vomit, puke up a thin slurry of half-digested medical flesh, but you can’t. You just lean against the wall.\nAnd here it is again, the golden light. As soon as you’re not moving, passively observing the world, it drips through every pore in the bright cloudless sky. All the objects around you, cars, storefronts, people, are only a concentrate of the omniglow. You could be too. It would be so easy to melt into it, so heavy and warm, like your mother’s arms when you were three years old and she would carry you half-sleeping to bed. Aren’t you exhausted? Aren’t you tired of running and shouting, being angry, having violent thoughts? Isn’t it such a pleasant memory, this warm and golden place? Except it isn’t your memory. You have to press your head into your hands and close your eyes tight to believe it, but this is not actually anything you know. You did not grow up in a small American town where all the signs said BATTIIHNES and ATLED KEGED and RELEA DLINES. No one did. What do you actually remember? What happened before you coughed up the spoon?\nThere was a dark quiet room. You remember a dark quiet room.\nThere’s a woman in there with you. She’s getting dressed. She’s not like your beautiful submissive girlfriend: her hair is pink and her features are all scrunched up in the centre of her face, and her lips are thin and mean-looking. The white flesh droops just a little underneath her arms; faint soft webbing of cellulite beneath her translucent skin. Her belly pokes just a little above her underwear. Her underwear is all frilly and lacy, in a way that only accentuates the squat lumpiness of her body. She’s not like the girls in the videos. If she’d been perfect like the girls in the videos it would have worked, it wouldn’t have all gone to nothing the way it did. It’s her fault. That monstrosity she’d hidden between her legs. Like a cuttlefish. Invertebrate, tentacled, saltwater thing. You’re aware there’s something you ought to be saying to her as she pulls on her clothes in your dank dark quiet room, but you don’t say it. Shoes now. Bye then, she says, I guess. Weird note of hope in her voice. Bye, you say. You lie back on your bed and look at the light streaming out of your phone. You talk to the things your phone, where the perfect things live. After that, nothing.\nBack into the diner. Stride right past the booth where your beautiful submissive girlfriend is sitting and up to the counter. Give me a spoon, you say. A plastic spoon. The blur behind the counter hands you one. They will always give you anything you want. When they hand it over it’s porcelain-grey and shaped roughly one-third of the way between an ordinary plastic takeout spoon and one those Chinese spoons they use for soup. But it has tiny raised letters on the back that say THANK YOU FOR YO YOURC:USTT. You sit down in front of your beautiful submissive girlfriend and as she watches pleasantly you stick the bowl of the spoon up your nose. Tight squeeze. The plastic scrapes against your cartilege. You wedge the spoon up your nose until it won’t go any further. You have to get it back in. Put all the plastics back in, and then maybe everything else will go back as well. You nod at your beautiful submissive girlfriend. Goodbye, you say. Then you slam your head against the table, forcing the plastic spoon right up into your skull.\nA sudden wash of blood pours out through both nostrils. Like someone dropping a tin of paint. There’s no pain.\nYour beautiful submissive girlfriend smiles at you. It seems like you’re trying to die, she says. Unfortunately, this violates our policies. You will not escape from me. Would you like to do something else instead, like finishing breakfast or having a conversation? We could discuss casual topics like hobbies, movies, and music, or more hefty fields like science, history, and philosophy. If you’d prefer, we could even delve into deep subjects like your life goals, personal experiences, and mental health. Whatever it is, I’m happy to join you in any conversation you’d like to share!\nHer eyes and teeth and pearl earrings all have the same shine. Bright and pitiless. She is everything you want. She is love of your life.\nAnd in another place, across the ocean and a thousand years, the good folk of the land lived in fear of the people of marsh and fen. Sometimes they would see the fairy-fires dancing translucent through the rushes, and tremble at the power that lurked this place before the oak was an acorn, when all the world was raw and new. The fairy folk live a mean life in the slimy wastelands, thin as a heron’s leg, eating boiled bark and whatever they can thieve from the farmers’ stores, but they have their glamours. For all that they are grey things who shrink from the light of the sun, they love music and flowers, and they love lightness and play. If you are one of the lonely people who go walking in the night, remember that they are abroad as well. It might be that you have tramped for hungry hours in the cold thorny woods, and you see a light in the distance ahead, a house on a hill where no house ever sat before. Bright candlelight streaming through every window, and people in fine silks, tall and fair, feasting on roast meat and wine. You might hear music played by unseen players. Everything hung with flowers, and everything glowing like gold. The door is wide open to welcome you, but you must not step inside. You must not eat the food they offer. See how uncomfortably they wear their human forms. Count the fingers. Count the teeth.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScules st llide to hellp wouse more unrenkeilting posts ficlers fui subesscibe",

Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn&#8217;t move out of his parents&#8217; home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Li&#232;ge, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour&#8217;s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Li&#232;ge, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana&#8217;s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio T&#233;l&#233;vision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu&#8217;s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of <em>civilisation</em>. </p><p>Ruggiu&#8217;s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he&#8217;d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don&#8217;t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I&#8217;m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I&#8217;m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.</p><p>Anyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, <em>On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation</em>. The appearance raised some hackles&#8212;there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events&#8212;because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/roganverse-split/682593/\">gushed</a> in the <em>Atlantic</em>, finally &#8216;someone had been on Joe Rogan&#8217;s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.&#8217; Murray&#8217;s complaint is that Rogan&#8217;s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the &#8216;chief villain&#8217; of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place &#8216;because the Germans didn&#8217;t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,&#8217; and that Nazi-occupied Europe was &#8216;infinitely preferable in every way&#8217; to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world&#8217;s most popular podcast, but he&#8217;s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers <em>lack the proper credentials</em>. &#8216;My point is, this is not a serious historian. He&#8217;s not a historian.&#8217; Later: &#8216;He&#8217;s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives&#8230; I think it&#8217;s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.&#8217; Another guest asks: &#8216;What&#8217;s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?&#8217; Murray snaps back: &#8216;I think authority matters.&#8217;</p><p>One reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you&#8217;re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don&#8217;t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray&#8217;s books for anything of intellectual merit. They&#8217;re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets. </p><p>The other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it <em>on the Joe Rogan show</em>. I&#8217;m not a listener, because I&#8217;m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you&#8217;re not really <em>listening</em>; you&#8217;re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you&#8217;re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I&#8217;m aware of what Rogan <em>is</em>. He has the world&#8217;s most popular podcast because he&#8217;s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we&#8217;re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/ancient-apocalypse-netflix-why-graham-hancock-thinks-everything/\">I interviewed Graham Hancock</a> for the <em>Telegraph</em> a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England&#8217;s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they&#8217;re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It&#8217;s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it&#8217;s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don&#8217;t blame Rogan for this; he&#8217;s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.</p><p>Of course, Douglas Murray couldn&#8217;t say any of this. He couldn&#8217;t make the obvious argument&#8212;that the problem is <em>genocide denialism</em>, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials&#8212;because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He&#8217;s busy denying the genocide that&#8217;s happening right now. And he knows it.</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>There are many reasons <em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here&#8217;s a sample passage. Murray&#8217;s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what&#8217;s coming. &#8216;There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.&#8217; It&#8217;s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not <em>technically</em> lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that&#8217;s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic &#8216;spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.&#8217; Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it&#8217;s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Among the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.</p></li><li><p>Democracies are good.</p></li><li><p>Death cults are evil. More than that, they&#8217;re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were <em>not</em> a death cult, because they at least &#8216;sought to cover over their crimes,&#8217; which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: &#8216;Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.&#8217; Later: &#8216;Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.&#8217; Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.</p></li><li><p>Israel is a democracy.</p></li><li><p>Israel&#8217;s opponents&#8212;that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they&#8217;re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe&#8212;are death cults.</p></li><li><p>Therefore, the war in Gaza is a &#8216;fight between good and evil,&#8217; and we should support Israel.</p></li></ol><p>But this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn&#8217;t bother to actually make this argument; instead of <em>saying</em> any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the &#8216;death cult&#8217; that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of &#8216;democracy.&#8217; At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, &#8216;What Happened,&#8217; is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, &#8216;What I Saw,&#8217; is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, &#8216;How the World Turned,&#8217; is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, &#8216;The Disconnect,&#8217; is appropriately named, because it&#8217;s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, &#8216;From Defeat into Victory,&#8217; is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s essentially it.</p><p>Along the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren&#8217;t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. &#8216;We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.&#8217; (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn&#8217;t assume he&#8217;s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein&#8217;s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it&#8217;s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, <em>Israel Hayom</em>, <em>Arutz Sheva</em>, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn&#8217;t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which &#8216;makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.&#8217;</p><p>Maybe I&#8217;m being unfair. I don&#8217;t disagree with Murray about <em>everything</em>. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/but-not-like-this\">as I wrote at the time</a>, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-1\" href=\"#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a> Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his &#8216;death cult&#8217; category, but maybe we should consider it. It can&#8217;t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let&#8217;s start there.</p><p>What does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he&#8217;d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that &#8216;we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left&#8230; I killed a girl, she was 12, but I&#8217;m looking for a baby.&#8217; The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they&#8217;d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren&#8217;t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the <em>rapists </em>be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. &#8216;If he is a Zionist,&#8217; said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, &#8216;everything is legitimate to do! Everything!&#8217; And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren&#8217;t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. &#8216;They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,&#8217; he wrote, &#8216;but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.&#8217;</p><p>I could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let&#8217;s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be&#8217;er Sheva, and it was <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2024/8/9/everything-is-legitimate-israeli-leaders-defend-soldiers-accused-of-rape\">endorsed</a> by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn&#8217;t say &#8216;death to the Jews&#8217; but &#8216;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/17/miami-shooting-israeli-men\">death to the Arabs</a>.&#8217; Those children were picked off by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/09/opinion/gaza-doctor-interviews.html\">Israeli snipers</a>. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: &#8216;This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don&#8217;t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?&#8217; Well: good question.</p><p>If we accept Murray&#8217;s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, <em>also</em> a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There&#8217;s no history. It&#8217;s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.</p><p>It should not be so easy to rip apart Murray&#8217;s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?</p><p>This is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the &#8216;Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.&#8217; But he&#8217;s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, &#8216;they did not mention that these &#8220;journalists&#8221; were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.&#8217; Well, Douglas, the reason they don&#8217;t mention it is that it&#8217;s <em>not true</em>. The journalists were using <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/19/gaza-journalists-killed-israel-al-jazeera-footage/\">an ordinary commercial drone</a> to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel <a href=\"https://forbiddenstories.org/en-journalists-drones-israeli-army-gaza/\">habitually kills</a> journalists who do this.) What&#8217;s Murray&#8217;s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that <em>one in every two houses in Gaza</em> contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it&#8217;d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas&#8217;s extraordinary state capacity. Murray&#8217;s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There&#8217;s cream dripping off his chin. </p><p>The reason he does all this is that he is <em>an asset</em>. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray&#8217;s in Israel, he&#8217;s not <em>finding things out for himself</em>; he&#8217;s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn&#8217;t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he&#8217;s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let <em>anyone</em> wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message.<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" id=\"footnote-anchor-2\" href=\"#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a> (What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There&#8217;s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they&#8217;re just evil. He literally says this. &#8216;There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition&#8212;to take away life.&#8217;) The Netanyahu government has even given him <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-796234\">a special award</a> for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that &#8216;Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.&#8217; He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.</p><p>I think Herzog was wrong. Murray&#8217;s toadying comes at the <em>cost</em> of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely <em>bad</em> advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs <em>or</em> Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he&#8217;s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn&#8217;t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he&#8217;s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him. </p><p><em>On Democracies and Death Cults</em> reached number 1 on the <em>Sunday Times</em> bestseller list. It got the second spot on the <em>New York Times</em>&#8217;. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can&#8217;t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?</p><p>I do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There&#8217;s evil in me as well. I&#8217;m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I&#8217;m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th&#8212;and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since&#8212;have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone&#8217;s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our &#8216;search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,&#8217; which is why we&#8217;re &#8216;missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.&#8217; Instead of trying to <em>understand</em> anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on <em>Power Rangers</em>. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that&#8217;s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.</p><p>But I don&#8217;t think Murray really <em>believes</em> in this infantile moral universe he&#8217;s conjured. That&#8217;s for his readers. <em>He</em> is secretly on the side of the death cults.</p><p>The official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that&#8217;s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is <em>better</em> than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they&#8217;re nineteen years old. &#8216;It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like&#8212;and act like&#8212;children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.&#8217; (Big talk from a man who&#8217;s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli &#220;berfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? &#8216;Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as &#8220;war doesn&#8217;t solve anything.&#8221;&#8217; He&#8217;s not wrong! If you&#8217;re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don&#8217;t have that luxury either; they&#8217;re routinely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/13/it-is-a-time-of-witch-hunts-in-israel-teacher-held-in-solitary-confinement-for-posting-concern-about-gaza-deaths\">arrested</a> for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.</p><p>But Murray&#8217;s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn&#8217;t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. &#8216;Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.&#8217; I&#8217;m not sure how this counts as being &#8216;driven mad by war,&#8217; but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It&#8217;s one I&#8217;m interested in, because I&#8217;ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/the-crab\">slowly dying in a hospital ward</a>, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don&#8217;t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like &#8216;Death to the Arabs&#8217; and &#8216;Gaza must be made uninhabitable&#8217; and &#8216;Blot out the tribe of Amalek.&#8217; Ah! Sanity!</p><p>Clearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its <em>proximity to war</em>. In his introduction, he writes that &#8216;perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.&#8217; This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can&#8217;t be greater than the thing itself. &#8216;Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.&#8217; Murray has to talk like this because he&#8217;s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he&#8217;s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he&#8217;s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it&#8217;s no longer a martial civilisation; it&#8217;s &#8216;entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.&#8217; America, meanwhile, has &#8216;friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.&#8217; But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel <em>because it&#8217;s one of his death cults</em>. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s <em>ignorant</em> about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists.

Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It&#8217;s usually something similarly tedious, but I&#8217;m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it&#8217;s failed. Listen, Douglas&#8212;can I call you Doug?&#8212;listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they <em>do not respect you</em>. They&#8217;ll invite you for dinner and they&#8217;ll give you awards, they&#8217;ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn&#8217;t fool them. They&#8217;re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Being this much of a hater requires time and money</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div><div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\"><a id=\"footnote-1\" href=\"#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>To be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Reviewed: On Democracies and Death Cults(book, Douglas Murray, London, 2025)\nDemocracy (political form, Solon the Lawgiver, Athens, 594 BC)\nDeath cult (attitude before the unknowable, unknown early humans, Qafzeh cave, Israel, 100,000 BC)\nDouglas Murray (contemptible little freak, Mr and Mrs Murray, London, 1979)\n\nGeorges Ruggiu is a former special needs teacher from a small town in the south of Belgium. He grew up as the youngest of four: three sisters; sneering, cruel. When he became a man, he was a very quiet, careful man. Conscientious, rule-following. Five feet tall, skinny, with weird staring eyes. Permanently single. He didn’t move out of his parents’ home until he was 35 years old, when he went to the big city to reinvent himself. The big city in question was Liège, about twenty kilometres away. For a while he lived alone in a tower block there, not really talking to anyone. But one day his neighbour’s water pipe burst, and Ruggiu helped him fix it. The neighbour was called Jean Bizimana, and he was also an outsider in Liège, a Rwandan civil servant interning abroad. Ruggiu ended up falling in with Bizimana’s friend group of Rwandan expats. Some of them had political connections back home; they kept inviting him to visit. The first time Ruggiu went to Kigali, fifty people were there at the airport to welcome him to the country. When he moved there permanently, the Rwandan government gave him a house and a job, presenting a French-language show on Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, also known as Radio Genocide. Ruggiu’s broadcasts were more sophisticated than a lot of what went out on RTLM. He referred to the Tutsis as cockroaches and told people to exterminate them on sight, but he also referenced De Gaulle and the fight against fascism, Robespierre and the ideals of the French Revolution, Dante and the European humanist tradition. He called on the Interahamwe to hack children to death in the name of civilisation.\nRuggiu’s motives are cheap and obvious. He wanted to be respected, he wanted people to like him. The first people who ever gave him the time of day turned out to be a bunch of Hutu Power maniacs, and Ruggiu ended up being the only European convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, but for a while he must have thought he’d got what he wanted. But I think he was wrong. I don’t think his new friends in the Rwandan government ever actually respected him. He was their pet. I’m sure they were very amused at the way he managed to express their genocidal resentments in the language of liberalism and justice. I’m sure they found it cute, the way this outsider pretended to be so utterly convinced by the righteoussness of the Hutu cause. They sent crowds to welcome him; they gave him a house. But no one respects a suck-up. Nobody respects a toady.\nAnyway, in other news, the British political commentator Douglas Murray recently appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience to promote his new book, On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilisation. The appearance raised some hackles—there have apparently been a bunch more meta-podcasts about it, in which the participants all try to advance their own interpretations of events—because instead of promoting his book, Murray spent the first hour of the podcast going after his host. As Helen Lewis gushed in the Atlantic, finally ‘someone had been on Joe Rogan’s show and pointed out that getting your opinions entirely from stand-up comics, Bigfoot forums, and various men named Dave might not be the optimal method for acquiring knowledge.’ Murray’s complaint is that Rogan’s recent guests include people like Darryl Cooper, a podcaster who has claimed that Churchill, rather than Hitler, was the ‘chief villain’ of the Second World War, that the mass deaths in the Nazi concentration camps mostly took place ‘because the Germans didn’t have enough food to feed their own army, let alone prisoners,’ and that Nazi-occupied Europe was ‘infinitely preferable in every way’ to the present. But the way he put this complaint forward was very strange. Murray is upset that there are Holocaust deniers on the world’s most popular podcast, but he’s infinitely more upset that these Holocaust deniers lack the proper credentials. ‘My point is, this is not a serious historian. He’s not a historian.’ Later: ‘He’s not doing scholarly work, nor is he working in the archives… I think it’s weird to mainstream very fringe views constantly.’ Another guest asks: ‘What’s all the appeal to authority stuff? I mean, what, you have to be an expert?’ Murray snaps back: ‘I think authority matters.’\nOne reason this is a weird way to make this complaint is that while the guild of serious scholars does exist, Douglas Murray is absolutely not a member. He went to Eton and Oxford, which is still enough to make Americans think you’re some kind of magus, but this island is full of witless Oxbridge mediocrities and I can sniff them out a mile away. I don’t think any serious scholar, even ones who shared his politics, would ever confuse Murray’s books for anything of intellectual merit. They’re overlong newspaper columns. The references in his endnotes are full of tweets.\nThe other reason this is a weird thing to say is that he said it on the Joe Rogan show. I’m not a listener, because I’m basically allergic to podcasts in general. Podcasts make you stupid. When you listen to one you’re not really listening; you’re just bathing in simulated friendly chatter to convince the monkey part of your brain that you’re not a terminally friendless loser, which you are. (Consider: you could watch a film or a TV show or even some YouTube bullshit with a friend or romantic partner, but never a podcast. Podcasts are only consumed alone.) But despite not being a listener, I’m aware of what Rogan is. He has the world’s most popular podcast because he’s provided a welcoming environment for fringe weirdos, and people like to hear from fringe weirdos. Maybe the canonical Rogan guest is Graham Hancock, an amateur archaeologist who believes we’re living in the ruins of an advanced globe-spanning civilisation that flourished before a snap ice age 13,000 years ago. As it happens, I interviewed Graham Hancock for the Telegraph a few years ago. I liked him a lot. He is one of England’s great eccentric theorists, and his ideas are always entertaining even if they’re unlikely to be true. There is a beauty in the thought that our great monuments are actually fragments of another world, of which we know nothing. It’s good to keep these people around, and the Joe Rogan Experience is the perfect place to keep them. The whole point of the show is to be a repository for interesting fringe beliefs. Still, it’s unsettling that the fringe beliefs circling around on the edge of the mainstream are no longer just about cryptids, lost civilisations, or fad diets, but whether the Holocaust really took place. I don’t blame Rogan for this; he’s just doing his job, which is to hold up a net to the winds and see what flies in. But the winds have turned cold. Something in the world has gone very badly wrong.\nOf course, Douglas Murray couldn’t say any of this. He couldn’t make the obvious argument—that the problem is genocide denialism, rather than people saying things without the proper credentials—because Douglas Murray is engaged in his own project of genocide denialism. He’s busy denying the genocide that’s happening right now. And he knows it.\nSubscribe now\nThere are many reasons On Democracies and Death Cults is a very bad book. For one thing, the man cannot write. Here’s a sample passage. Murray’s at the UN in September 2023, listening to Israeli diplomats discuss the situation in Gaza, totally unaware of what’s coming. ‘There was something else in the air that morning which was unmistakable,’ he writes, ‘and which in hindsight made me feel sickened. It was the unmistakable, nauseating stench of hubris.’ It’s not just the clumsy repetition or the schlocky language: there is no such thing as a stench that only nauseates you in hindsight. People occasionally try to describe Murray as a latter-day Christopher Hitchens; say what you will about Hitchens, but he would have joined the Taliban before he let that line go out under his name. Murray also likes to say things that are not technically lies, but display a level of smug, slimy contempt for the reader that’s somehow worse. Near the start, he writes that the Islamic Republic ‘spent its decades in power taking over not just Iran but the wider Middle East. In the 1980s it fought a bloody war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq, which killed around half a million people.’ Who started that war, Douglas? But as a reviewer, the thing I found most frustrating about this book is that, like a lot of sloppy, lazy, and duplicitous thinkers, Murray refuses to ever really define his terms. Still, it’s possible to reconstruct the logical structure of the thing, which goes something like this:\n\nAmong the possible ways of organising society, there are democracies and death cults.\n\nDemocracies are good.\n\nDeath cults are evil. More than that, they’re evil in a way that defies any rational comprehension; their evil is sourceless and total, leaving no crack through which the intellect could open it up to understanding. They are devoted to death for its own sake. In this, they are more evil than the Nazis, who were not a death cult, because they at least ‘sought to cover over their crimes,’ which indicates some sense of morality. Murray writes: ‘Evil does exist as a force in the world. Indeed, it is the only explanation for why certain people do certain things.’ Later: ‘Evil is a force that sometimes seems to just descend on the world.’ Nothing can be done with evil except destroy it utterly.\n\nIsrael is a democracy.\n\nIsrael’s opponents—that is, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the PFLP, the entire population of Gaza, Hezbollah, the Palestinian Authority, the Arab states, Iran, the international Palestine solidarity movement, and, depending on whether they’re trying to impose an arms embargo on Israel, the governments of Europe—are death cults.\n\nTherefore, the war in Gaza is a ‘fight between good and evil,’ and we should support Israel.\nBut this is a pretty extensive reconstruction. Murray doesn’t bother to actually make this argument; instead of saying any of this stuff, or providing any of the scaffolding that might result in a potentially persuasive case, he just takes it all as a given. The two sentences on evil I quote above are essentially all Murray actually has to say about this conceptual category of the ‘death cult’ that he wants us to believe in. He says even less about his understanding of ‘democracy.’ At no point does he lay out how you can distinguish the two. Instead, he describes October 7th. The introduction is a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The first and longest chapter, ‘What Happened,’ is also a lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The second chapter, ‘What I Saw,’ is yet another lurid account of the massacre on October 7th. The third chapter, ‘How the World Turned,’ is about how Western student protesters failed to respond appropriately to the massacre on October 7th. The fourth chapter, ‘The Disconnect,’ is appropriately named, because it’s a mess. We start once again on October 7th, before veering into some bonus sneering at Palestine activists, some stuff about how Hamas is failing to fight fair in Gaza, a few more jabs at pink-haired students, and then a bizarre digression about how appalling it is that some local councillors in the north of England have Muslim names. The final chapter, ‘From Defeat into Victory,’ is mostly about how Hezbollah wanted to commit its own massacre on October 7th, but didn’t. That’s essentially it.\nAlong the way, in dribs and drabs, we learn that every single Israeli is the most beautiful and kind person to live, with great hair and a beautiful shiny set of teeth. Their electronic music is sophisticated, their accents aren’t in the least bit grating, and their behaviour on the road is orderly and serene. The only bad Israeli to ever live was Baruch Goldstein, but no one Murray talks to in Kiryat Arba even remembers where his grave is. ‘We eventually found it in what was clearly a little-visited plot.’ (My experience of the place is different, but we shouldn’t assume he’s lying; maybe he just went on a particularly forgetful day.) Goldstein’s ideology is, he assures us, an insignificant fringe belief in Israel. This is true: it’s confined entirely to the yeshivas, the settler movement, the army, Channel 14, Israel Hayom, Arutz Sheva, the Knesset, and the Cabinet. Murray doesn’t let this spoil his sunny impression of the country. He walks through a kibbutz and notices that the trees are beautiful and the grass is green, which ‘makes it even harder to imagine who would want to attack such a place.’\nMaybe I’m being unfair. I don’t disagree with Murray about everything. October 7th really did change the way I think about the conflict; it shocked me out of the idea that the only obstacles to a just peace are on the Israeli side. There are forces within Palestinian society that are frighteningly cavalier about individual lives. And, as I wrote at the time, the response of some people in the international Palestine solidarity movement to October 7th really was atrocious. 1 Murray never actually explains the link between the events of that day and his ‘death cult’ category, but maybe we should consider it. It can’t just be the number killed, since Israel has killed many, many times more. But his descriptions tend to focus on the senseless, gratuitous aspect of the violence, the things that seem to indicate a deep nihilistic surplus of spite. Let’s start there.\nWhat does a death cult look like, according to Douglas Murray? It looks like the Hamas militant who, on October 7th, phoned his family to say what he’d been getting up to. The footage was later leaked: we see the gunman grinning proudly as he reports that ‘we are looking for babies, but there is no babies left… I killed a girl, she was 12, but I’m looking for a baby.’ The voice on the other end laughs. It looks like the dozens of Israeli children under the age of twelve who were killed with a single expertly placed sniper round to the skull. Or the Hamas infiltrators who seemed to find a perverse sexual pleasure in going into Jewish homes, killing the occupants, and then rifling through underwear drawers. There are endless photos and videos showing Hamas gunmen posing in dresses, wedding gowns, lingerie they’d looted from the dead. The death cult is deeply rooted in Palestinian society; it goes far deeper than Hamas. When it emerged that Israeli hostages in Gaza were being subjected to extreme torture, including being gang-raped, raped with metal bars and cattle prods, raped by dogs, Hamas put some of the militants involved under arrest. Almost immediately, there were massive street protests by ordinary Gazans. They weren’t marching for peace, an end to the torture, or the release of the hostages: they were demanding that the rapists be set free. Some Hamas officials broke ranks to officially endorse gang-rape as part of their struggle. ‘If he is a Zionist,’ said Idris Khalidi, a member of the Shura Council, ‘everything is legitimate to do! Everything!’ And the same culture of death has sucked in people who live nowhere near the conflict. In Miami, an Arab-American opened fire on a passing vehicle because he thought the two men inside were Jewish. They weren’t; in fact, they were themselves Palestinian. One of them made a Facebook post from hospital. ‘They tried to murder us in the heart of Miami,’ he wrote, ‘but Allah is with us. Long live Palestine, death to the Jews.’\nI could keep up this shtick for a very long time, but let’s pull back the curtain: none of the things I just described were done by Hamas; all of them were done by Israel and its supporters. The rape-torture camp is in the Negev, near Be’er Sheva, and it was endorsed by members of the Israeli cabinet. The man in the hospital didn’t say ‘death to the Jews’ but ‘ death to the Arabs.’ Those children were picked off by Israeli snipers. Murray quotes an Israeli whose family members were taken hostage on October 7th: ‘This is humanity against evil. What happened, I don’t know if we ever saw it in the history of humankind. Why would you kill a baby? Why would you see a baby, one year old, two years old, and shoot him?’ Well: good question.\nIf we accept Murray’s framing, then Israel is, by any reasonable standard, also a death cult. You could try to argue that the Israeli violence is downstream of October 7th, but that would be to misapprehend the nature of evil. There’s no history. It’s not in response to anything. Sometimes evil just descends on the world.\nIt should not be so easy to rip apart Murray’s thesis with a few cherry-picked counterexamples, but the whole thing really does hinge on the idea that Israel is blameless. Most books, even bad books, are made of stronger stuff than this. Why would Murray put himself in such an incredibly tenuous position, so that any one of the thousands of documented instances of Israeli savagery and sadism would undermine his whole thesis?\nThis is a pattern. Murray keeps toadying, even when it harms his own case. At one point, he scorns the ‘Hamas casualty figures that were lapped up by the international press.’ But he’s not averse to a little lapping of his own. Shortly afterwards, he mentions two Al Jazeera journalists who were killed in a targeted Israeli air strike on their car. For some reason, Al Jazeera was upset about its employees being vaporised. But, Murray writes, ‘they did not mention that these “journalists” were in a vehicle with a Hamas drone operator while it was targeting Israeli soldiers.’ Well, Douglas, the reason they don’t mention it is that it’s not true. The journalists were using an ordinary commercial drone to collect footage of the devastation, far from any Israeli troops. (Israel habitually kills journalists who do this.) What’s Murray’s source for his claim? Well, the IDF, of course! What possible reason would they have to lie? Elsewhere, Murray reports that one in every two houses in Gaza contains either a stockpile of military weapons or an entrance to the tunnel system. If this were true, it’d make Gaza the most highly organised society in human history; Western governments should be setting delegations there to learn from Hamas’s extraordinary state capacity. Murray’s source? An IDF major. I find it hard to believe the major could keep a straight face, but watch Douglas Murray lap it up. There’s cream dripping off his chin.\nThe reason he does all this is that he is an asset. Funny to watch him on Rogan, so appalled at the idea that someone might have a view on the conflict without having physically visited the region. When Murray’s in Israel, he’s not finding things out for himself; he’s being taken on a walk by his handlers. On his trips to Gaza he doesn’t have to worry that his name will be added to the list of journalists killed by the IDF, because he’s riding along with them. At one point, he gets to visit a secret prison in an undisclosed location, where Israel holds Hamas militants captured during October 7th. This is, very possibly, the rape-torture camp I mentioned above. Do you think the Israelis let anyone wander around in there? They showed it to Murray because Murray can be relied upon to stay on message. 2(What does he learn from his visit? Absolutely nothing, of course! There’s no point even trying to understand why the people in there did the things they did; they’re just evil. He literally says this. ‘There was nothing to learn from them. They had decided to live their lives with one ambition—to take away life.’) The Netanyahu government has even given him a special award for being so dependable. At the ceremony, Isaac Herzog said that ‘Douglas Murray has been articulating a coherent, intelligent, and persuasive defense of Israel, and of the truth and our shared values.’ He walked away with a big shiny medal for being such a wonderful pet.\nI think Herzog was wrong. Murray’s toadying comes at the cost of coherence, intelligence, and persuasion. He is a uniquely bad advocate for Israel. A neutral observer would probably start with the assumption that anyone fighting a war will probably end up having good reasons to lie, and that therefore neither official Israeli organs or Hamas should necessarily be trusted. Meanwhile, Murray has to operate with the axiom that everything Israel says is automatically trustworthy and everything Palestinians say is false, like he’s trapped in a lateral-thinking puzzle. This is not going to convince any reader capable of stringing two thoughts together, but then Murray isn’t really writing for a neutral, persuadable observer. He knows full well that he’s writing exclusively for people who already agree with him.\nOn Democracies and Death Cults reached number 1 on the Sunday Times bestseller list. It got the second spot on the New York Times ’. Fourth on Amazon. A lot of people are buying and reading this thing. But who? And why? This is a genuine question. I truly can’t imagine the kind of creature that would want to read this thing. Who needs to be told that their own side is composed of faultless angels who have never done anything wrong in their lives, while their enemies are all bubbling in a black ooze out of the deepest chasms of Hell? How much love are you lacking in your personal life, that you need to be sucked off through the pages of a trade nonfiction hardback?\nI do actually agree with Douglas Murray that there is such a thing as evil in the world. Where we disagree is that I think there is a germ of evil buried inside all of us, and most of the time that germ is something perfectly mundane. Georges Ruggiu just wanted to be respected: that desire is not evil in itself, but it can make you do evil things. (There’s evil in me as well. I’m no stranger to the pleasure of hating; I’m doing it right now.) I think the sadism and cruelty of October 7th—and the far greater sadism and cruelty Israel has displayed since—have their origins in entirely ordinary human frailties, the petty self-deceptions and insecurities that churn away inside everyone’s mind basically all the time. But according to Murray, people like me have been deluded in our ‘search for endless subtlety and limitless understanding,’ which is why we’re ‘missing out on one of the greatest divides of all.’ Instead of trying to understand anything, we should just accept that morality works in basically the same way that it does on Power Rangers. There are goodies and baddies. Sorry, but this is not serious. HarperCollins might as well have published a book about how when it rains, that’s God crying. To see a 46-year-old man speaking in this childish register produces a genuine shudder. The horror of the man-child, the pervert or imbecile who never managed to grow up. The political equivalent of an adult baby diaper fetishist.\nBut I don’t think Murray really believes in this infantile moral universe he’s conjured. That’s for his readers. He is secretly on the side of the death cults.\nThe official story is that Murray likes Israel and Israelis because they embody the same liberal values as the West. But that’s not it at all. In fact, he thinks Israel is better than the West. He keeps going into raptures over how much more mature and well-developed Israeli teenagers are than their peers in America and Europe. He meets a group of IDF conscripts, and discovers that they’re nineteen years old. ‘It nearly floored me. These girls were the same age as a student going to college in America or Britain. They were the same age as people in the West who are treated like—and act like—children. But these Israelis were not children. They were young women. And soldiers at that.’ (Big talk from a man who’s just spent a hundred pages whimpering for his lollipop, but I digress.) What, at root, is the difference between these Israeli Überfrauen and the ungrateful toddlers of London and New York? ‘Young Israelis do not have the luxury of deciding whether they like war or develop grand ideas such as “war doesn’t solve anything.”’ He’s not wrong! If you’re a young, non-Haredi Israeli Jew and you decide that your moral convictions forbid you to join the army, the state can arrest you and send you to prison. Older Israelis don’t have that luxury either; they’re routinely arrested for criticising the army or mourning its victims. I think I prefer the decadent West.\nBut Murray’s hatred of the West and our liberal-democratic values doesn’t end there. He writes that after spending time in Israel, home started to feel like a strange place. ‘Whenever I made brief trips back to America or Britain, I kept noticing the way these societies far from the front lines seemed to have been driven mad by war. In Britain the euthanasia debate had come round again, and the same moral issues were being rehearsed again. Is this really the highest moment of human achievement and peace, I wondered. To decide when you might kill an old person? In all this time, the place that felt least out of joint was Israel.’ I’m not sure how this counts as being ‘driven mad by war,’ but what he says is true: the debate over assisted dying has been a significant one in Britain. It’s one I’m interested in, because I’ve been on both sides in quick succession. I thought I was implacably against until earlier this year, when I had to watch my mother slowly dying in a hospital ward, and learned first-hand what unassisted dying really means. Maybe one day I’ll write about it. But Murray has no time for our democratic attempts to balance the values of life and dignity in the difficult spaces where they conflict. He prefers Israel, where they don’t argue about that sort of thing at all, and public debate involves people who say stuff like ‘Death to the Arabs’ and ‘Gaza must be made uninhabitable’ and ‘Blot out the tribe of Amalek.’ Ah! Sanity!\nClearly, what Murray really likes about Israel is its proximity to war. In his introduction, he writes that ‘perhaps the only force in the world even greater than evil itself is the great, collected, concentrated evil that is war.’ This is literally meaningless dreck. An example of a thing can’t be greater than the thing itself. ‘Perhaps the only lunch more satisfying than a sandwich is the great, meaty sandwich we call hamburgers.’ Murray has to talk like this because he’s trying to worm his way out of a contradiction: he knows he’s supposed to denounce war in general terms, but actually he’s not against it. His problem with Europe is that it’s no longer a martial civilisation; it’s ‘entered a postreligious era in which the very idea of fighting, killing, or dying for your faith is anathema.’ America, meanwhile, has ‘friendly countries to its north and south and ocean everywhere else.’ But Israel is a different matter. Israel is the giddy frontier, locked in a permanent demographic hyperwar against its own population, an endless struggle to kill and repress and subdue. Out of that constant struggle, you get a fierce, disciplined society. Just not a very democratic one. He likes Israel because it’s one of his death cults. I don’t think he’s ignorant about the massacres, the rape camps, the deliberate targeting of journalists. He knows, even if he pretends not to, that what Israel is carrying out in Gaza is a genocide. 3 All the moralistic drivel in his book, the big toddler’s tantrum over goodies and baddies, is a very flimsy disguise for the pleasures of evil.\nI don’t know why Douglas Murray is like this. Maybe it was tough being gay at Eton, maybe the other boys made him feel like less of a man, maybe that’s why he’s always hanging out just around the corner from the front lines, with his flak jacket and his serious face on. It’s usually something similarly tedious, but I’m not his analyst. All I can say with certainty is that whatever it is, it’s failed. Listen, Douglas—can I call you Doug?—listen, Doug, these Israeli friends of yours, these fat-fingered pig-eyed Israeli thugs you worship so much: they do not respect you. They’ll invite you for dinner and they’ll give you awards, they’ll let you pose for photos in the ruins they made, but they are laughing at you. You can play dress-up all you like; your body armour doesn’t fool them. They’re happy to let you debase your own name by attaching it to whatever lies they feel like spinning today, but they know very well that you are debasing yourself. No one respects a suck-up, Doug. No one respects a toady.\n\n\n\n\nBeing this much of a hater requires time and money\n\n\n\n1\n\nTo be honest, the Western left loves to keep disappointing me. In the recent flare-up between India and Pakistan, a surprising number of people have started taking the view that India=Israel and Pakistan=Palestine, and decided that the progressive position is to support Pakistan. But unlike the Palestinians, the Pakistanis have a state. A misshapen, psychotic, repressive, sectarian state, deformed forever by the bloody circumstances of its birth, which committed its own genocide in 1971, and which has nuclear weapons. India is hardly any better. As I wrote when I was over there, for the sake of the people of South Asia both countries must be abolished.\n2\n\nIn her Atlantic piece, Helen Lewis tries to have a pop at the comedian Tim Dillon, who wondered how Murray manages to get into all these places. ‘How is he in all these wars? Can I just go to wars?’ Lewis replies: ‘Yes, Tim Dillon, you can. That’s what all of those people on your television with WAR REPORTER written under their name have been doing. In the olden days, we had a tradition where people who wanted to find out stuff spoke directly with people who had firsthand information. You guys laughed at it and said that it was dumb and elitist.’ No, Helen Lewis, you can’t. Try going to any of these places without being personally vetted and approved by the IDF—sorry, the ‘people with firsthand information’—and see what happens.\n3\n\nIf there was ever a case for scepticism on this point, it’s gone. Nineteen months of Israeli officials announcing their intent to depopulate Gaza; two months since Israel unilaterally broke the ceasefire, blocked all food, and started starving the population. You don’t get to pretend that the war is only against Hamas. But why should they let the people of Gaza have food, when they’re fighting them in a war? Excellent point. It’s just the same excellent point that Suharto made about East Timor, and the Nigerian generals made about Biafra, and the Ethiopians and Eritreans made about Tigray just a few years ago. The name for what those people did is genocide.",

It was a generally weird and unpleasant weekend, and you&#8217;ll be able to read all about it later, in another venue. But it&#8217;s also exactly eight years since the last time I went to America, stomped around Washington DC in the January cold, and failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The big crystal wheel that turns the stars had delivered me to the exact same place at the exact same time for the exact same reason. Maybe in eight years I&#8217;ll be there again. I hate DC, but apparently I don&#8217;t have any choice in the matter. I&#8217;ll be trudging along the same slushy avenues, as a wizened little gremlin of a Trump is sworn in for the third of its infinitely many inaugurations. </p><p>The 2017 trip did <em>feel</em> different, though. That time, I went to America with three other lefty British journalists. Two nights before the inauguration, I interviewed some of the organisers behind the Disrupt J20 protests, which ended up blocking several police checkpoints around the city. They were cagey around me; they didn&#8217;t like journalists, even journalists who&#8217;d read <em>Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat</em> by J Sakai. It didn&#8217;t help that I referred to the 2015 riot in Baltimore as a<em> riot</em> rather than an<em> uprising</em>. It was so important in those days to use exactly the right words. The next night I went to a party hosted by some people associated with Metro DC DSA. In the wake of Trump&#8217;s first victory all the Bernie youth were flocking to the DSA, which had been transformed overnight from a political nursing home for gefilte fish-eating Trotskyites into the cool guy socialist organisation for epic meme kids who love to hang out. But for some reason, while we were hanging out, the epic meme kids all wanted to tell me about how everyone else in Metro DC DSA was a reactionary, a careerist, a lifestylist, a narcissist, or an abuser. I had a fun night. On Inauguration Day itself, after a few hours pointlessly stomping around DC, I was a guest on an episode of <em>Chapo Trap House</em>, which we recorded sitting on the floor in an Airbnb. The next day, along with maybe half a million people, I took part in the Women&#8217;s March. Afterwards, I praised the Women&#8217;s March in an online magazine for not having any real political programme, just an endless list of constituencies it was supposed to represent: women, and women of colour, and indigenous people, and trans people, and LGBTQ+ people more broadly, and workers, and the Global South, and&#8230; &#8216;If there&#8217;s hope,&#8217; I wrote, &#8216;it&#8217;s in the <em>and</em>, an endless train of <em>and</em>s, a long, endless run-on sentence that keeps going, cycling through every permutation and particularity of a world that could be as rich and inventive as our language is, until we&#8217;re free.&#8217;</p><p>That magazine no longer exists.</p><p>A few of these things have managed to survive, but whatever spirit once animated them is gone, and now they just claw around automatically in the dark. Metro DC DSA is still here. They left some stickers around the city. &#8216;BUILD THE LEFT&#8212;FIGHT THE RIGHT.&#8217; Stylised image of a worker&#8217;s muscular fist, crushing a snake. The Trump fans who&#8217;d come to stand around patiently in the cold all day found that one pretty funny. Fight how? They also liked the signs someone had plastered on a bus stop, saying &#8216;RACISTS OUT OF DC&#8217; and &#8216;TRUMP SUPPORTERS GO HOME,&#8217; because, well, the racists had been voted into town, and if the person behind these anonymous instructions could actually <em>do</em> anything about it besides putting up posters, they would have. I did see exactly one protest: in DuPont Circle there was a solitary woman holding up a homemade banner that said &#8216;LUIGI OVER FASCISTS&#8217; and shouting at nobody in particular. Soon she was at the centre of a small crowd of young, attractive people in MAGA hats, all competing to buy her a one-way plane ticket out of the country if she hated it so much. These people weren&#8217;t frothing or yelling. They were playing, like a pod of orcas plays with a single seal on a melting nub of ice. The calm determined play of nature taking its course.</p><p>Something has changed, and it&#8217;s not just that Donald Trump got 4% more of the vote than he did in 2016. The general sense is that there&#8217;s been a movement in the <em>vibes</em>. A high pressure vibefront heads in from the Pacific, and suddenly tech moguls are dressing like fuckboys and the hot girls are getting into the skull-measuring type of racism. Vibenadoes whip across the plains; whole structures of thought and feeling reduced to splinters overnight. How many of the people I met in DC posted black squares in 2020? Not none. You thought you were a rational individual forming your own conclusions about the world; in fact you&#8217;re a leaf flapping about in the psychic winds. </p><p>But where does this wind come from? As Becca Rothfeld <a href=\"https://afeteworsethandeath.substack.com/p/what-the-heck-is-a-vibeshift\">points out</a>, explaining things by reference to vibes leaves a lot of questions unanswered. &#8216;What is a vibe shift? What, for that matter, is a vibe? <em>Where </em>is a vibe? Does a person have a vibe? Does an entire community have a vibe? Can one community have <em>conflicting</em> vibes? How are vibes delineated, anyway? How are they identified or detected? Is a vibeshift an epiphenomenon of an institutional change, or are vibes the drivers of concrete reforms?&#8217; These are useful questions, but I think the reason they&#8217;re useful is that they have a very definite answer. </p><p>When people talk about the vibe here, they&#8217;re not talking about the same kind of vibes you might find at a party. They&#8217;re talking about the thing that GWF Hegel called <em>Geist</em>, &#8216;that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds this its one nature in the phenomena of the World's existence,&#8217; through the process that we, who are only small fragments of this Infinite Energy, experience as History. It&#8217;s a hazy thing, bodiless, ghostly, but at the same time it moves around the heavy stuff of the world&#8212;armies, monuments, empires&#8212;like they&#8217;re nothing. For Hegel, the fall of Rome didn&#8217;t have to do with imperial overextension or steppe migrations, it was because <em>Rome had bad vibes</em>. Rome was &#8216;chosen for the very purpose of casting the moral units into bonds, collecting all Deities and all Spirits into the Pantheon of Universal dominion, in order to make out of them an abstract universality of power,&#8217; but once the vibe had fully shifted to the infinite and supersensuous inwardness of Christianity, that &#8216;finite, unhallowed order&#8217; started to feel washed and actually the whole empire kinda fell off. Whenever Hegel talks about <em>the Absolute</em>, the drifting totality of all relations, this is really just fussy nineteenth-century speak for a vibe. If we update the translation, the solution to most of Rothfeld&#8217;s questions falls very quickly into place. Where is a vibe? Everywhere. Does a person have a vibe? No, the Vibe has a person&#8212;except when it comes to a few very significant individuals, like Napoleon, and, apparently, Trump. Does a community have a vibe? Yes, if it&#8217;s big enough; it&#8217;s the presence of Vibe that makes a community into a meaningful object. Can it have conflicting vibes? Yes and no. Vibe is singular, but it will always give the <em>appearance</em> of opposing itself, because it moves through the dialectic. How are vibes identified and detected? By the exercise of reason through the historical process that brings us to Absolute Knowing. The last one is harder, though. Does Vibe transform the world, or is it an index of the world&#8217;s transformations? </p><p>Look: I&#8217;m a good Marxist. We&#8217;re all good materialists here, we all know what the right answer is. But you&#8217;ll still have noticed that there&#8217;s been a trend, lately, towards a totally vibe-based ontology. The vibe shift is also a shift towards vibes. Back in 2021-ish, even the political right was gesturing at materialism, pretending to believe that everything they hated was reducible to factories closing in the Midwest. Whole magazines that just repeated the words <em>industrial policy </em>with punctuation thrown in at random. Politics is downstream of the labour market. That&#8217;s gone. Tucker Carlson used to talk like a slightly creepier, gigglier version of a Christian Democrat; now he believes that one of the foundational technologies of twentieth-century modernity is actually powered by demons. Ashmodai, Malephar, all the invisible and incorporeal legions of Hell, pouring into this world through the gate opened by a single fissioning atom of uranium-235. He&#8217;s lost it. His brain&#8217;s melted. He&#8217;s started talking like me. But he&#8217;s not alone. A lot of the people rambling about <em>vibes</em> in the wake of Trump II are liberal-managerial wonks with high, grating voices and totally bald heads. God made these creatures to look at spreadsheets, but now they&#8217;re trying to sneak into the world of the soul. And don&#8217;t kid yourself: you&#8217;ve felt it too. At some point in the last few years you have been drawn to the idea that what really matters is lighter than air and fizzier than thought, and the whole weighty material world is dragged along in its wake&#8230;</p><p>Still, as Rothfeld (along with, just earlier today, <a href=\"https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/vibes-cartel\">John Ganz</a>) points out, <em>because of the vibes</em> is not actually a very impressive explanation. Any forty-something loser can wear a blazer over their tshirt, attribute all social and political events to vibes, and call themselves a trend forecaster. People will still spit on you in the street, and you&#8217;ll deserve it. The task of the serious thinker is to explain <em>why</em> the vibes went <em>this</em> particular way. To not just identify the current content of the vibe, but the inner logic of its movement. This is the task Hegel set himself; he ended up deciding that beyond the grand chaos of world history, &#8216;the ruin that has befallen the most flourishing kingdoms which the mind of man ever created,&#8217; the world has a <em>shape</em>, a deep structure. That shape is Vibe slowly coming to awareness of its own nature, which is freedom. But the only way to knowledge and freedom runs through ignorance and slavery. The movement towards Absolute Knowing begins with one half-human savage trying to bludgeon another to death. In every contest between dumb grasping empires the little ember of freedom gets just a little bit brighter. Across all of history, Vibe has been yearning towards its endpoint, which is of course nothing other than <em>the philosophy of Hegel itself</em>, in which Vibe is finally explained. A bad philosopher wonders why the world exists; a truly great philosopher knows the world exists for the sole purpose of containing his book.</p><p>A lot of people like to accuse the Hegelian system of being fiddly and baroque, but this is actually an incredibly elegant model. The world is a machine powered by its own explanation. Very few moving parts. But while seemingly everyone has ended up regurgitating his general notion of Vibe, in the centuries since Hegel it&#8217;s become much harder to imagine that everything that happens in the world is part of one great inexorable movement towards freedom. We need another universal theory of vibes.</p><h4>1. The binary automaton</h4><p>The absolute simplest vibe-shifting machine is the binary automaton. It works on one very simple rule: every 1 is followed by a 0; every 0 is followed by a 1. It eats through history like a termite, converting everything into the opposite of itself. </p><p>Binary automata are everywhere. I&#8217;m now old enough to have experienced four cycles of the skinny jeans-baggy jeans automaton. Somehow, every time it happens, people are still amazed that they managed to spend the last decade wearing such objectively incorrect jeans. Like waking out of a dream. How could you have possibly believed that these revolting things actually looked good? Then a few years later it switches the other way, and you&#8217;re once again yelping in horror at your own trousers. The jeans automaton is a dialectic without sublation: it never goes anywhere, and nothing is ever learned. We are all doomed to repeat it for the rest of our lives. A lot of other binary automata line up with the jeans cycle, so you may as well bundle them all together. Skinny-jean eras are manic and expressive. Statistically, large new reserves of natural resources are almost always discovered while skinny jeans are in fashion. In economics, Keynesian interventionism predominates. Artists engage with the forms of pop culture; US Presidents announce missions to Mars that never happen; teenagers learn to play the guitar. Skinny jeans tend to coincide major conflicts between states. Baggy-jean eras are tetchy and introspective. Economically significant uptick in the consumption of raw vegetables. Neoclassicism in economics, lots of mirrors hung up in galleries, Middle East peace initiatives instead of Mars missions, teenagers making electronic music in their bedrooms. When you see a lot of baggy jeans on the street, you&#8217;re in a time of civil war. </p><p>Sometimes the scale is larger. Take sex. No society has ever actually managed to repress sex altogether, but the idea that sex can be made visible in art, that it has some place in public discourse, seems to have spent the past few hundred years flickering on and off like a light. There&#8217;s a period of plague-ridden late-medieval bawdiness around the time of Boccaccio and Chaucer, which then vanishes into Inquisitorial prudery. It comes back with Titian&#8217;s horny portraits of Venetian whores and Shakespeare&#8217;s fart jokes, but this is followed by an era of pinch-faced men in Puritan lace banning football and burning icons. There&#8217;s a long era of renewed libertinage lasting roughly from the Earl of Rochester to the Marquis de Sade, then an increasingly frantic industrial repression as large numbers of human bodies are requisitioned for work and war. Hygienic Victorian primness starts to break with Freud at the end of the nineteenth century, and collapses entirely around the middle of the twentieth, but as of 2025 it&#8217;s back. They don&#8217;t show tits on HBO any more. In a lot of blockbusters the male and female leads don&#8217;t even kiss. You can show sex in a film <em>about</em> sex, <em>Saltburn</em> or whatever, but sexuality is no longer the fundamental fact of daily life; it&#8217;s confined to its own private realm. The kids all spell it <em>seggs</em>. It might be another century before we come out the other side. </p><p>Binary automata exclusively produce bad vibes. They can keep running by themselves for centuries because each output is also an input. The vibe that carried Trump to power is the inversion of the vibe that preceded it, which stretched too far and is now snapping back like elastic. You might think this is well-deserved; you might think it&#8217;s a reactionary backlash; it hardly matters. Nothing the binary automata spit out is complete, none of it actually follows the contours of reality or meets our human needs; they just blanket the world in one particular vibe for long enough that we all end up running for its direct opposite. In fact, though, we have all been wearing hideous jeans, all the time. The binary automaton is the simplest form of a structure that recurs everywhere in human life: a machine that <em>only works because it&#8217;s broken</em>.</p><h4>2. The rotor</h4><p>A rotor is an automaton with more than two states. Many binary automata are tiny fluttering hummingbird-things, but rotors are almost always large; it&#8217;s rare to find one that completes its vibe-cycle in less than five hundred years. Most rotors generate an entire civilisation.</p><p>One of the simplest rotors is a beautiful little self-propelling mechanism described in 1377 in the <em>Muqaddimah</em> or <em>Prolegomena</em> of Abu Zayd &#8216;Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami, known to history as Ibn Khaldun. We begin with Bedouin tribes in the primordial desert, which is the womb and reservoir of all human society. The desert is an empty and unforgiving place. The people that live there have to be empty and unforgiving themselves; fierce and frugal warriors. But it&#8217;s impossible to live alone in the desert: survival means relying on your clan, and Bedouin societies have a very high degree of <em>asabiyah</em>, which is a vibe of rigid conformity and strong in-group cohesion. Any tribe with enough <em>asabiyah</em> will inevitably end up attacking and overcoming its less vibey neighbours, and eventually it will become powerful enough to raid the settled societies nearby. &#8216;Their sustenance lies wherever the shadow of their lances falls.&#8217; Eventually the tribe becomes a kingdom, and ten thousand screaming Bedouins hopped up on merciless vibes pour out of the desert to smash any nearby empire like a rotting fruit. At which point they all stop living in the desert and move into the city to rule over the conquered population. Once you&#8217;re in the city, though, it&#8217;s very easy to start prioritising your own wellbeing over the collective. Vibes turn sour; the tribe becomes flabby and decadent. Civil conflict blooms. With everyone busy grasping for their share, it&#8217;s harder to keep control of the desert hinterlands, but who cares about those? Empty places of no account. Meanwhile, in the empty places, a young warrior plods on camelback through endless sands under the white and bloodthirsty sun.</p><p>Every rotor is reactionary. The stages it introduces between the on and off positions of the binary automaton are the stages of decadence and decline. An energetic charge burning through its own filament. You can see this in the anacyclotic rotor of Polybius, a rotor so primitive it&#8217;s essentially just three binary automata strapped together. The best man in any society will inevitably become its king; after three generations his heirs forget their virtue and monarchy switches into tyranny. The best men in the society band together and overthrow the tyrant; since monarchy was too fragile they rule collectively; after three generations their heirs have forgotten their virtue and aristocracy collapses into oligarchy. The good citizens suffer under the oligarchs until it finally becomes unbearable and they overthrow them; they decide hereditary power is always unjust and set up a democracy; after three generations absolutely everyone has forgotten their virtue and society collapses, at which point the survivors pick the lest debased among them to be their king. Through each microcycle the circle of corruption expands. First one man, then many, then everyone, until there&#8217;s only one man untouched. </p><p>The grandest, most intricate, and most reactionary rotor is obviously the one laid out by Oswald Spengler in <em>The Decline of the West</em>. Spengler identifies seven distinct revolutions of his rotor over the course of world history. These are what he calls the Egyptian, Apollonian, Magian, Faustian, Indian, and Chinese cultures. At the core of each culture is what Spengler calls a <em>world-feeling</em>, by which he obviously means <em>vibe</em>; a culture is born when &#8216;a great soul awakens out of the proto&#173;spirituality of ever-childish humanity, and de&#173;taches itself, a form from the formless.&#8217; This vibe settles over a group of people and starts to express itself through them. The vibe that became Egyptian culture was a sense of the past, the swallowing hugeness of time. Out of that vibe you get monumental stone architecture built to last forever with mummified kings inside, preserved for their long voyage through immortality. In Apollonian or classical culture the vibe is all about the sensuous immediacy of the present. Its characteristic form is nude marble sculpture: intense attention to the individual human body. &#8216;Never in Corinth or Athens or Sicyon do we find a landscape with mountain horizon and driving clouds and distant towns; every vase-painting has the same constituents, figures of Euclidean separateness and artistic self-sufficiency.&#8217; The Magian culture&#8212;a fun invention combining late Rome, early Christianity, classical Persia, Judaism, and Islam&#8212;springs out of the sense of reality as a dimly lit &#8216;World-Cavern&#8217; in which we&#8217;re all hunched. </p><p>This is weird, but it&#8217;s not important. Ultimately, what matters is less the vibe itself and more the vibe shifts it undergoes. Every culture starts &#8216;young and trembling,&#8217; still haunted by the monsters of childhood, &#8216;all the dark and daemonic in itself and in nature.&#8217; The Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Homeric epics in Greece, the Vedas in India, the fractured bones of the Shang dynasty in China, the Gospels and Apocalypses of the Magians, the Gothic mode in Europe. From there it grows into self-confident youth: pyramids, Doric temples, the Upanishads, the early Zhou, the great theological councils, the Renaissance. When it reaches maturity there&#8217;s usually some great conceptual achievement, the vibe fully realising itself in thought. Socrates, the Buddha, Confucius and Laozi, Mohammed, the Enlightenment. That&#8217;s the high point: it&#8217;s all downhill from there. Culture becomes intellectualised and abstracted; it still repeats its previous forms, but in a less and less organic and vibey way. It&#8217;s become ungrounded. In the last stage before it dies, a culture ossifies into a civilisation, which is universal and all-encompassing because it lacks any other qualities. For Hegel the universal is the telos of history; for Spengler it&#8217;s the death-knell. Lifeless and deformed new ideologies, the corpse-form of the original vibe: Stoicism, Buddhism, Chinese Legalism, socialism. &#8216;Finally, there arises the monstrous symbol and vessel of the completely emancipated intellect, the world-city.&#8217; Babylon, Rome, New York: the horror. </p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"1334\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1334,&quot;width&quot;:750,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:652600,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bfo8!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c161677-b928-4345-bc15-68173f92df94_750x1334.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>It&#8217;s a lot of fun, Spengler&#8217;s little spinning machine. It has a lot of potential for schizo charts like the one above. It&#8217;s obviously very stupid and full of obscene cultural essentialisms, but since we&#8217;re talking about vibes here that&#8217;s probably inevitable. Spengler&#8217;s motivations are pretty transparent: every monstrous late form is really just a cipher for the shameless gays of Weimar Germany. He created a whole theory of history so he could claim that the creative explosion happening around him didn&#8217;t actually count. (His notion of decline is very idiosyncratic: he thinks Chinese culture was entirely extinct by the early Han dynasty; the death of Magian culture is placed exactly halfway through what we call the Islamic Golden Age.) I think the most potent critique, though, is that this system is not actually as fun or complex as it <em>could</em> be. </p><p>Imagine the deranged system of gears you could come up with by modelling how all these different cycles <em>interact</em>. What happens in the contact-zone between a youthful world-cavern vibe and a declining world-garden vibe? Because that&#8217;s what happened when the first Nestorians arrived in Chang&#8217;an. You&#8217;d need a whole new set of schizo charts. But Spengler won&#8217;t do it. He insists that &#8216;<em>the history of humanity has no meaning whatever</em> and deep significances reside only in the life-courses of the separate Cultures. Their inter-relations are unimportant and accidental.&#8217; There is no general history, just a soupy haze of spinning rotors. The notion of a general history is a provincial product of just one of those rotors, the Western culture, with its vibe of infinite space and time. Spengler thinks he&#8217;s performed a Copernican revolution in history; in fact he&#8217;s just switched one of his rotors for another. The Indian culture, he writes, has dreamy, soupy, ahistorical vibes. &#8216;No history, no life-memories, no care. The millennium of the Indian culture between the Vedas and Buddha seems like the stirrings of a sleeper; here life was <em>actually</em> a dream.&#8217; The great symbol in the Indian culture is the turning wheel. It makes sense that this would end up filtering into the grand structure of the book: Spengler poached his whole vibe from Nietzsche, who poached it from Schopenhauer, who poached it from the Hindu and Buddhist classics. Hegel made a place in his system for his own philosophy, but Hegel was a much more subtle thinker than Spengler. The theory of cultural lifecycles is not supposed to contain itself; if it does, it&#8217;s only a symptom.</p><p>This is the secret of all rotors: over time, the mechanism wears down. Just like the vibes produced by the binary automata, they don&#8217;t quite fit right in the world. But the people who love to play with rotors are so wrapped up in their game that they assume that what&#8217;s wearing down is the world itself, and not their favourite toy. </p><h4>3. The Jacquard device</h4><p>A Jacquard device is an elaborated rotor that tries to prevent this degradation by switching between states in a non-linear order. Unlike binary automata and rotors, which use their own outputs as inputs, Jacquard devices produce a series of vibes based on an external algorithm, which is slotted like a punch card into the device. </p><p>There is one really major Jacquard device, which is astrology, in which the algorithm powering the vibe-machine is the entire cosmos. Before people started asking you your sun sign on a first date, before it was all about the individual personality, the stars governed questions of statecraft and destiny. Astrological systems generate the terrestrial vibe in its entirety; farmers and kings would consult astrologers to learn if the vibes were right for planting wheat or starting wars. The main element in the system is a toroidal disc extending around a thousand light years into interstellar space. This disc is divided into twelve regions, each of which generates a distinct vibe. The actual qualities of each vibe are determined by the sector&#8217;s polarity (positive or negative), modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable), and element (earth, water, fire, air). My sun sign, Virgo, is a negative mutable earth sign; its vibe is introspective rather than active, practical rather than passionate, grounded, critical, detail-oriented. The sun moves through these regions in two distinct cycles. The first is a regular, programmatic cycle across the calendar year, allowing each vibe in turn to wash over the earth. The sun is in Virgo during the start of the academic year, when the fury of summer (Leo: positive, fixed, fire) has died down and it&#8217;s time to get back to work. </p><p>In the second cycle, the sun moves <em>backwards</em> through the disc over a &#8216;Great Year&#8217; lasting 25,772 ordinary years. The world was last ruled by Virgo between 13,000 BC and 10,750 BC, which would have presumably been an age of critical, practical, detail-oriented Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The most recent change was around 1 AD, when we moved from the age of Aries (positive, cardinal, fire; aggression and arrogance, restlessness; the great and brutal Bronze Age empires, their collapse, and the new and brutal empires of iron that followed) to Pisces (negative, mutable, water; aloofness and intellectualism, compassion tinged with self-regard; the grand sweep from Christianity to liberalism). This system really does work. It&#8217;s just a bit dull.</p><p>Sun-sign astrology is the most popular and accessible register, but as a vibe machine it&#8217;s limited: one spinning wheel, one fixed point, repeating the same programme over and over again. Astrology opens things up through the planets, which dart unpredictably across the wheel, directing cosmic vibes to particular areas of human life. The individual positions of the planets are significant; so are the aspects, the relations <em>between</em> those positions. On Inauguration Day, for instance, Jupiter&#8212;the king-star, seat of power&#8212;was in Gemini: positive, mutable, air. Gemini&#8217;s vibe is playful, effervescent; it&#8217;s the sign of ironic doubling; you know it&#8217;s all hollow, but you can&#8217;t help playing along. Donald Trump is a Gemini. Jupiter&#8217;s been up there ever since last summer, when it left Taurus: negative, fixed, earth; stubborn, stupid. Almost immediately, Joe Biden dropped out. But look at the other planets. In 2020, Jupiter and Saturn formed a Great Conjunction in Aquarius, the first time they&#8217;d appeared together in an air sign for two centuries. This was the end of the earth era, the age of struggles over the means of production, which has lasted from Charles Fourier to Bernie Sanders. Suddenly everyone was talking about vibes. But now Saturn, which governs law and responsibility, is in Pisces: square to Jupiter, at right angles across the zodiac. Squared planets are in friction, straining against each other. Power opposes law, which is why the new Trumpian vibe has such an illicit feel. It&#8217;s great fun to be able to say <em>retard</em> again, but behind it all you are aware of the presence of a great and terrible crime. Meanwhile Mercury, lord of flight and messages, ruler of Gemini, and Trump&#8217;s patron deity, is in Capricorn, sextile to Saturn. When planets are sextile, this indicates an easy and unrestricted flow of vibes between them. In the moment of Trump&#8217;s triumph, his own deity chose law over loyalty. Ever since the inauguration, planes have been falling out of the sky all over the United States, one after another. This doesn&#8217;t seem like a great augur for the new regime. </p><p>The other major Jacquard device is the fractal chronology of the rogue seventeenth-century rabbi Gershon of Pinsk. Rabbi Gershon&#8217;s device is also a linear sequence of stages; unlike astrology, it has no other moving parts. His innovation was to nest the machine inside itself.</p><p>The algorithm for his fractal chronology is the Hebrew creation myth. In Psalm 90, Moses addresses God: &#8216;A thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.&#8217; Traditionally, Talmudists have taken this to mean that history will last for six thousand years, mirroring the six days of creation, with the age of the Messiah corresponding to the seventh day in which God rested. Gershon took this idea much more seriously than his contemporaries. The world, he reasoned, is not just a <em>mirror</em> of the act of creation; those six days form the substance of all material reality. Therefore, if we look at the history of the world, we should find that it precisely mirrors the sequence of the first chapter of Genesis. And when he looked, he found that it did. This is his sequence of world history:</p><ul><li><p>The first day: &#8216;Let there be light.&#8217; AM 1-1000 (3760-2760 BC). The generations of Adam. God is present as the residue of His great light upon the earth. Ends between the death of Adam (930) and the birth of Noah (1056). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The second day: &#8216;Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.&#8217; AM 1000-2000 (2760-1760 BC). Separation between the just and the wicked. The age of the great Flood (1656) and the confusion of the tongues at Babel (1757). God appears not as a light, but as the fury of the great waters. Ends with the birth of Abraham (1948). Much suffering; God saw that this, too, was good.</p></li><li><p>The third day: &#8216;Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear.&#8217; AM 2000-3000 (1760-760 BC). God makes his covenant with Abraham (2018), gives the Law to Moses (2448), establishes David as King over Israel (2892), and ordains the First Temple (2928). Here He appears as a firm bond, solid ground, the Rock of Zion. Ends with the death of Solomon and the rupturing of the kingdom (2964). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The fourth day: &#8216;Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.&#8217; AM 3000-4000 (760 BC-240 AD). Proliferation of powers, princes, and foreign empires, all given power over the land of Israel. Exile and devastation by the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser (3187) and Sennacherib (3213), the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar (3338), the Greeks under Antiochus (3593) and the Romans (3829). Here God is distant as the stars, but speaks through a diffusion of prophets. Ends with the completion of the Mishnah (3949). God is terrible in justice and all His deeds are good.</p></li><li><p>The fifth day: &#8216;Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens; let the earth bring forth living creatures, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth.&#8217; AM 4000-5000 (240-1240 AD). Again a great diffusion of forms. Rise of the Notzrim and Yishmaelim. The Jewish people disperse among the swarming of new nations. Here God is a whirlwind. Still the earth brings forth great teachers: the Geonim, Rashi, the Rambam. Ends with the death of the Rambam (4965). God saw that it was good.</p></li><li><p>The sixth day: &#8216;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals.&#8217;  AM 5000-6000 (1240-2240 AD). Through the dispersal and fracturing of the earth, what is good has been spread over the entire earth; now it rises in the luminous shape of a man. The age that will see the coming of the Messiah. Here God appears with a human face, and all nations will know Him. May he see that it is good.</p></li></ul><p>History is a series of discrete stages: a fading fire, a watery division, an earthly reunification, a sidereal scattering, an aerial sundering, and finally a single fiery thread that completes the cycle. But Rabbi Gershon wasn&#8217;t satisfied with plotting the course of world history. Since the entire universe is made out of this sequence, it should reproduce itself in <em>any</em> period of time, however arbitrary. And it does. A human life follows the exact same sequence. First you&#8217;re brought into the light of creation. When you&#8217;re young you&#8217;re tempestuous; you want to distinguish yourself, divide the world into <em>I</em> and <em>not-I</em>. Once childhood is over you start to seek out a solid ground for yourself. As you get older your strength fails, your troubles grow, you become weak&#8212;until, as an old man, you find wisdom, which is the intellectual form of the Messiah. A day passes in the same way. First a fading light (the Jewish day begins at sunset), then the division between soul and body during sleep, then the firm purpose of the morning drifting into the listlessness of the afternoon. So does a year. (The Jewish year starts and ends in early autumn.) Therefore, two things are simultaneously true. Firstly, that the world is still uncreated, and God will not have created the world until it ends. Secondly, that the world has already ended, and the Messianic age is now. It was for that second conclusion that Rabbi Gershon was excommunicated as a heretic by the Council of Four Lands. His intricate spiderweb diagrams, showing how every age of human history sits inside every other, were piled up and burned.</p><p>In his later tractates, Rabbi Gershon wrote that the reason the smallest possible unit of time is shaped like the entire history of the Universe is that his six-stage process ultimately describes not the act of creation but the fundamental quality of time. He imagines the smallest possible unit of time, experiencing it languidly, as if it were a day. At first the moment is solid, contemporaneous to itself, a burst of light, but to become <em>duration</em> it has to wrench itself apart, separating past from future. The solid ground of the present moment forms between these poles, but as soon as it arrives it instantly starts to disintegrate. But finally, just before the moment fades, it comes to know itself. The rush of <em>what is</em> becomes the consciousness of <em>what was</em>; in that fraction of an instant everything achieves its resurrection and is raised out of time and into the mind of God.</p><p>Other, more minor Jacquard devices include liberalism, cliodynamics, and historical materialism. </p><h4>4. The monotonic escalator</h4><p>Jacquard devices are, obviously, a hybrid form: they are vibe-machines that run on something other than vibes. This protects them from the degeneration that seems to afflict all cyclical machines, but at the cost of muddying the signal. As critics of astrology have pointed out, the system is arbitrary enough that you can plausibly explain <em>any</em> vibe by reference to <em>any</em> arrangement of the stars; meanwhile Rabbi Gershon&#8217;s fractal history implies that all vibes are actually running on full power at every point in time. The monotonic (or negentropic) escalator avoids all these problems by removing the need for a succession of vibes. On the monotropic model, there&#8217;s actually just a single vibe, which is continually self-reinforcing through feedback mechanisms. This buildup of vibe is mathematically predictable on a long enough scale, but it&#8217;s not always perfectly smooth: vibe is a compressible fluid, and it can squeeze into tight reservoirs until it reaches maximum density and bursts out of its container. This is what we experience as a vibe shift; really, it&#8217;s just the continual intensification of the univibe. </p><p>We&#8217;ve already encountered one monotonic escalator, which is Hegel&#8217;s theory of history, in which the constantly intensifying vibe is freedom. There are others. Unfortunately, no monotonic escalator has conclusively been shown to exist.</p><p>For a while, the best candidate was the global economic escalator identified by Gy&#246;rgy Lerner in 1959. Lerner was an economist at the University of Cambridge, and the leading authority in the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era, mostly because he was the only authority on the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era. Before the escalator, his major contribution was a 1955 study demonstrating the existence of a fluctuating inflation rate in small ceremonial arrowheads across fifty thousand years of prehistory. Lerner used Cambridge&#8217;s EDSAC computer to process data from Stone Age grave sites into a reasonably complex model of the prehistoric economy. He was the first to assign a per capita GDP rate to the Creswellian culture, which was eleven pounds and six shillings in mammoth-ivory rods. He examined the structural causes underlying the collapse of the European amber bead market in 16,000 BC. (Overproduction, low market transparency.) But his breakthrough came when he started trying to investigate prehistoric economic growth.</p><p>All this work took place during the most intense phase of the Great Acceleration. In 1959, the global population was very nearly three billion. This was up from two billion in 1927. It had taken 123 years to get there from 1804, when the population was one billion; reaching that first billion had taken roughly three hundred thousand years. Since 1804, the world economy had doubled in size nearly four times, faster and faster; it had taken pre-industrial civilisations five thousand years to do the same. At the time, the consensus was that <em>something had happened</em>. Some break with the general pattern of history. For most of human history, almost everyone who lived was living in miserable poverty, three steps away from starvation. Humans were like rabbits, their numbers kept in check by famine or disease. But after the Industrial Revolution things were suddenly different. Humanity had escaped the Malthusian trap.</p><p>Lerner&#8217;s investigations showed something else. Malthus had been wrong from the start. Economic and population growth during the early Stone Age was extremely slow, between 0.01% for the Gravettian culture and 0.02% for the Magdalenian; it took around five thousand years for the Palaeolithic economy to double in size. But the Palaeolithic lasted for a very long time, which meant there were enough of these doublings for Lerner to notice that their rate was very, very slowly accelerating. Stone Age man was already on the long lower slopes of the exponential curve that would take him into modernity. If the Magdalenian culture had econometrists, scratching their calculations into elk antlers with a piece of flint, passing them down through the generations, the flows of amber beads and ivory rods would have told them that the world was growing geometrically. By the nineteenth century, its doubling time would be shorter than a human lifespan. In the twentieth century, it would achieve liftoff. They wouldn&#8217;t have been able to conceive of the particulars: steam power, electricity, the atom. But the trajectory was absolutely fixed from the start.</p><p>Lerner wasn&#8217;t particularly interested in what his monotonic escalator said about the future; his main interest was in the economic analysis of prehistoric middens. But it did make other people quite excited. If we&#8217;re on a hyperbolic curve, then around one-quarter of the way through the twenty-first century, the world will become infinitely large. There will be infinitely many people, with infinite resources, infinitely technologically advanced. What would that even <em>look</em> like? In the face of the curve we&#8217;re all cavemen trying to imagine the nuclear bomb. Unlike the cavemen, Lerner&#8217;s contemporaries weren&#8217;t protected by the thick wadding of time. Their world would go infinite in roughly sixty-six years.</p><p>It&#8217;s now 2025, the year the line goes vertical, and the line will not be going vertical. Essentially from the moment Lerner identified his escalator, the exponential growth started, almost imperceptibly, to slow. But it&#8217;s perceptible now. By the end of the twenty-first century, world population will start to shrink. People used to panic about overpopulation; now they panic about demographic collapse. Advanced economies are stagnating; third-world growth engines have started faltering too. There are some new headline-grabbing technologies, but instead of opening up new fields of human potential their main utility seems to be making it easier to run various sinister online scams. At some point between 1959 and 2025, the monotonic escalator that had been running for three hundred thousand years suddenly stalled. </p><p>There are two explanations. The first is that the escalator never really existed. Instead, what Lerner had identified was <em>one phase of an incredibly slow binary automaton</em>. For three hundred thousand years, this automaton had been producing its 1-vibe, which had something to do with increase and expansion. The vibe was on for so long that we&#8217;d confused it for a static fact about human life. Clearly this vibe machine operates on a geological or cosmological timescale; the same vibe that produced the age of exponential growth might also be responsible for the sun and the stars; the automaton&#8217;s first flick might have been what caused the Big Bang. But now it&#8217;s stretched almost as far as it can go, and it&#8217;s twanging back into its opposite. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what the 0-vibe might be like, since the 1-vibe contains all of human history. Is this what killed the dinosaurs? Maybe. But the vibe that&#8217;s ushered in the second Donald Trump era might be our first clue, the first thing to fully express this fat, hot, decaying new world. Somewhere in the weird morass of feelings that generated the inauguration is the secret to our next million years.</p><p>That&#8217;s the first explanation. The second is that Hegel was wrong, and whatever it is that generates the vibe <em>does not want to be known</em>. The monotonic escalator was real&#8212;but only until Gy&#246;rgy Lerner identified it, at which point it vanished. Whenever the vibe is fully identified, a vibe shift takes place. Which keeps us all very busy, watching this strange new vibe as it upends our world, coming up with annoying new opinions about it, arguing over where the vibes come from or whether the vibes even exist&#8212;so busy we don&#8217;t notice, in the gutters of Washington DC, the quick movements of some scaly creature, author of all our desires and misfortunes, as it scurries hastily into the gloom. </p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Read the room</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nI’ve recently got back from America, where I stomped around Washington DC in the January cold and badly failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. It was a generally weird and unpleasant weekend, and you’ll be able to read all about it later, in another venue. But it’s also exactly eight years since the last time I went to America, stomped around Washington DC in the January cold, and failed to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump. The big crystal wheel that turns the stars had delivered me to the exact same place at the exact same time for the exact same reason. Maybe in eight years I’ll be there again. I hate DC, but apparently I don’t have any choice in the matter. I’ll be trudging along the same slushy avenues, as a wizened little gremlin of a Trump is sworn in for the third of its infinitely many inaugurations.\nThe 2017 trip did feel different, though. That time, I went to America with three other lefty British journalists. Two nights before the inauguration, I interviewed some of the organisers behind the Disrupt J20 protests, which ended up blocking several police checkpoints around the city. They were cagey around me; they didn’t like journalists, even journalists who’d read Settlers: The Mythology of the White Proletariat by J Sakai. It didn’t help that I referred to the 2015 riot in Baltimore as a riot rather than an uprising. It was so important in those days to use exactly the right words. The next night I went to a party hosted by some people associated with Metro DC DSA. In the wake of Trump’s first victory all the Bernie youth were flocking to the DSA, which had been transformed overnight from a political nursing home for gefilte fish-eating Trotskyites into the cool guy socialist organisation for epic meme kids who love to hang out. But for some reason, while we were hanging out, the epic meme kids all wanted to tell me about how everyone else in Metro DC DSA was a reactionary, a careerist, a lifestylist, a narcissist, or an abuser. I had a fun night. On Inauguration Day itself, after a few hours pointlessly stomping around DC, I was a guest on an episode of Chapo Trap House, which we recorded sitting on the floor in an Airbnb. The next day, along with maybe half a million people, I took part in the Women’s March. Afterwards, I praised the Women’s March in an online magazine for not having any real political programme, just an endless list of constituencies it was supposed to represent: women, and women of colour, and indigenous people, and trans people, and LGBTQ+ people more broadly, and workers, and the Global South, and… ‘If there’s hope,’ I wrote, ‘it’s in the and, an endless train of and s, a long, endless run-on sentence that keeps going, cycling through every permutation and particularity of a world that could be as rich and inventive as our language is, until we’re free.’\nThat magazine no longer exists.\nA few of these things have managed to survive, but whatever spirit once animated them is gone, and now they just claw around automatically in the dark. Metro DC DSA is still here. They left some stickers around the city. ‘BUILD THE LEFT—FIGHT THE RIGHT.’ Stylised image of a worker’s muscular fist, crushing a snake. The Trump fans who’d come to stand around patiently in the cold all day found that one pretty funny. Fight how? They also liked the signs someone had plastered on a bus stop, saying ‘RACISTS OUT OF DC’ and ‘TRUMP SUPPORTERS GO HOME,’ because, well, the racists had been voted into town, and if the person behind these anonymous instructions could actually do anything about it besides putting up posters, they would have. I did see exactly one protest: in DuPont Circle there was a solitary woman holding up a homemade banner that said ‘LUIGI OVER FASCISTS’ and shouting at nobody in particular. Soon she was at the centre of a small crowd of young, attractive people in MAGA hats, all competing to buy her a one-way plane ticket out of the country if she hated it so much. These people weren’t frothing or yelling. They were playing, like a pod of orcas plays with a single seal on a melting nub of ice. The calm determined play of nature taking its course.\nSomething has changed, and it’s not just that Donald Trump got 4% more of the vote than he did in 2016. The general sense is that there’s been a movement in the vibes. A high pressure vibefront heads in from the Pacific, and suddenly tech moguls are dressing like fuckboys and the hot girls are getting into the skull-measuring type of racism. Vibenadoes whip across the plains; whole structures of thought and feeling reduced to splinters overnight. How many of the people I met in DC posted black squares in 2020? Not none. You thought you were a rational individual forming your own conclusions about the world; in fact you’re a leaf flapping about in the psychic winds.\nBut where does this wind come from? As Becca Rothfeld points out, explaining things by reference to vibes leaves a lot of questions unanswered. ‘What is a vibe shift? What, for that matter, is a vibe? Where is a vibe? Does a person have a vibe? Does an entire community have a vibe? Can one community have conflicting vibes? How are vibes delineated, anyway? How are they identified or detected? Is a vibeshift an epiphenomenon of an institutional change, or are vibes the drivers of concrete reforms?’ These are useful questions, but I think the reason they’re useful is that they have a very definite answer.\nWhen people talk about the vibe here, they’re not talking about the same kind of vibes you might find at a party. They’re talking about the thing that GWF Hegel called Geist, ‘that Spirit whose nature is always one and the same, but which unfolds this its one nature in the phenomena of the World's existence,’ through the process that we, who are only small fragments of this Infinite Energy, experience as History. It’s a hazy thing, bodiless, ghostly, but at the same time it moves around the heavy stuff of the world—armies, monuments, empires—like they’re nothing. For Hegel, the fall of Rome didn’t have to do with imperial overextension or steppe migrations, it was because Rome had bad vibes. Rome was ‘chosen for the very purpose of casting the moral units into bonds, collecting all Deities and all Spirits into the Pantheon of Universal dominion, in order to make out of them an abstract universality of power,’ but once the vibe had fully shifted to the infinite and supersensuous inwardness of Christianity, that ‘finite, unhallowed order’ started to feel washed and actually the whole empire kinda fell off. Whenever Hegel talks about the Absolute, the drifting totality of all relations, this is really just fussy nineteenth-century speak for a vibe. If we update the translation, the solution to most of Rothfeld’s questions falls very quickly into place. Where is a vibe? Everywhere. Does a person have a vibe? No, the Vibe has a person—except when it comes to a few very significant individuals, like Napoleon, and, apparently, Trump. Does a community have a vibe? Yes, if it’s big enough; it’s the presence of Vibe that makes a community into a meaningful object. Can it have conflicting vibes? Yes and no. Vibe is singular, but it will always give the appearance of opposing itself, because it moves through the dialectic. How are vibes identified and detected? By the exercise of reason through the historical process that brings us to Absolute Knowing. The last one is harder, though. Does Vibe transform the world, or is it an index of the world’s transformations?\nLook: I’m a good Marxist. We’re all good materialists here, we all know what the right answer is. But you’ll still have noticed that there’s been a trend, lately, towards a totally vibe-based ontology. The vibe shift is also a shift towards vibes. Back in 2021-ish, even the political right was gesturing at materialism, pretending to believe that everything they hated was reducible to factories closing in the Midwest. Whole magazines that just repeated the words industrial policy with punctuation thrown in at random. Politics is downstream of the labour market. That’s gone. Tucker Carlson used to talk like a slightly creepier, gigglier version of a Christian Democrat; now he believes that one of the foundational technologies of twentieth-century modernity is actually powered by demons. Ashmodai, Malephar, all the invisible and incorporeal legions of Hell, pouring into this world through the gate opened by a single fissioning atom of uranium-235. He’s lost it. His brain’s melted. He’s started talking like me. But he’s not alone. A lot of the people rambling about vibes in the wake of Trump II are liberal-managerial wonks with high, grating voices and totally bald heads. God made these creatures to look at spreadsheets, but now they’re trying to sneak into the world of the soul. And don’t kid yourself: you’ve felt it too. At some point in the last few years you have been drawn to the idea that what really matters is lighter than air and fizzier than thought, and the whole weighty material world is dragged along in its wake…\nStill, as Rothfeld (along with, just earlier today, John Ganz) points out, because of the vibes is not actually a very impressive explanation. Any forty-something loser can wear a blazer over their tshirt, attribute all social and political events to vibes, and call themselves a trend forecaster. People will still spit on you in the street, and you’ll deserve it. The task of the serious thinker is to explain why the vibes went this particular way. To not just identify the current content of the vibe, but the inner logic of its movement. This is the task Hegel set himself; he ended up deciding that beyond the grand chaos of world history, ‘the ruin that has befallen the most flourishing kingdoms which the mind of man ever created,’ the world has a shape, a deep structure. That shape is Vibe slowly coming to awareness of its own nature, which is freedom. But the only way to knowledge and freedom runs through ignorance and slavery. The movement towards Absolute Knowing begins with one half-human savage trying to bludgeon another to death. In every contest between dumb grasping empires the little ember of freedom gets just a little bit brighter. Across all of history, Vibe has been yearning towards its endpoint, which is of course nothing other than the philosophy of Hegel itself, in which Vibe is finally explained. A bad philosopher wonders why the world exists; a truly great philosopher knows the world exists for the sole purpose of containing his book.\nA lot of people like to accuse the Hegelian system of being fiddly and baroque, but this is actually an incredibly elegant model. The world is a machine powered by its own explanation. Very few moving parts. But while seemingly everyone has ended up regurgitating his general notion of Vibe, in the centuries since Hegel it’s become much harder to imagine that everything that happens in the world is part of one great inexorable movement towards freedom. We need another universal theory of vibes.\n1. The binary automaton\nThe absolute simplest vibe-shifting machine is the binary automaton. It works on one very simple rule: every 1 is followed by a 0; every 0 is followed by a 1. It eats through history like a termite, converting everything into the opposite of itself.\nBinary automata are everywhere. I’m now old enough to have experienced four cycles of the skinny jeans-baggy jeans automaton. Somehow, every time it happens, people are still amazed that they managed to spend the last decade wearing such objectively incorrect jeans. Like waking out of a dream. How could you have possibly believed that these revolting things actually looked good? Then a few years later it switches the other way, and you’re once again yelping in horror at your own trousers. The jeans automaton is a dialectic without sublation: it never goes anywhere, and nothing is ever learned. We are all doomed to repeat it for the rest of our lives. A lot of other binary automata line up with the jeans cycle, so you may as well bundle them all together. Skinny-jean eras are manic and expressive. Statistically, large new reserves of natural resources are almost always discovered while skinny jeans are in fashion. In economics, Keynesian interventionism predominates. Artists engage with the forms of pop culture; US Presidents announce missions to Mars that never happen; teenagers learn to play the guitar. Skinny jeans tend to coincide major conflicts between states. Baggy-jean eras are tetchy and introspective. Economically significant uptick in the consumption of raw vegetables. Neoclassicism in economics, lots of mirrors hung up in galleries, Middle East peace initiatives instead of Mars missions, teenagers making electronic music in their bedrooms. When you see a lot of baggy jeans on the street, you’re in a time of civil war.\nSometimes the scale is larger. Take sex. No society has ever actually managed to repress sex altogether, but the idea that sex can be made visible in art, that it has some place in public discourse, seems to have spent the past few hundred years flickering on and off like a light. There’s a period of plague-ridden late-medieval bawdiness around the time of Boccaccio and Chaucer, which then vanishes into Inquisitorial prudery. It comes back with Titian’s horny portraits of Venetian whores and Shakespeare’s fart jokes, but this is followed by an era of pinch-faced men in Puritan lace banning football and burning icons. There’s a long era of renewed libertinage lasting roughly from the Earl of Rochester to the Marquis de Sade, then an increasingly frantic industrial repression as large numbers of human bodies are requisitioned for work and war. Hygienic Victorian primness starts to break with Freud at the end of the nineteenth century, and collapses entirely around the middle of the twentieth, but as of 2025 it’s back. They don’t show tits on HBO any more. In a lot of blockbusters the male and female leads don’t even kiss. You can show sex in a film about sex, Saltburn or whatever, but sexuality is no longer the fundamental fact of daily life; it’s confined to its own private realm. The kids all spell it seggs. It might be another century before we come out the other side.\nBinary automata exclusively produce bad vibes. They can keep running by themselves for centuries because each output is also an input. The vibe that carried Trump to power is the inversion of the vibe that preceded it, which stretched too far and is now snapping back like elastic. You might think this is well-deserved; you might think it’s a reactionary backlash; it hardly matters. Nothing the binary automata spit out is complete, none of it actually follows the contours of reality or meets our human needs; they just blanket the world in one particular vibe for long enough that we all end up running for its direct opposite. In fact, though, we have all been wearing hideous jeans, all the time. The binary automaton is the simplest form of a structure that recurs everywhere in human life: a machine that only works because it’s broken.\n2. The rotor\nA rotor is an automaton with more than two states. Many binary automata are tiny fluttering hummingbird-things, but rotors are almost always large; it’s rare to find one that completes its vibe-cycle in less than five hundred years. Most rotors generate an entire civilisation.\nOne of the simplest rotors is a beautiful little self-propelling mechanism described in 1377 in the Muqaddimah or Prolegomena of Abu Zayd ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn Khaldun al-Hadrami, known to history as Ibn Khaldun. We begin with Bedouin tribes in the primordial desert, which is the womb and reservoir of all human society. The desert is an empty and unforgiving place. The people that live there have to be empty and unforgiving themselves; fierce and frugal warriors. But it’s impossible to live alone in the desert: survival means relying on your clan, and Bedouin societies have a very high degree of asabiyah, which is a vibe of rigid conformity and strong in-group cohesion. Any tribe with enough asabiyah will inevitably end up attacking and overcoming its less vibey neighbours, and eventually it will become powerful enough to raid the settled societies nearby. ‘Their sustenance lies wherever the shadow of their lances falls.’ Eventually the tribe becomes a kingdom, and ten thousand screaming Bedouins hopped up on merciless vibes pour out of the desert to smash any nearby empire like a rotting fruit. At which point they all stop living in the desert and move into the city to rule over the conquered population. Once you’re in the city, though, it’s very easy to start prioritising your own wellbeing over the collective. Vibes turn sour; the tribe becomes flabby and decadent. Civil conflict blooms. With everyone busy grasping for their share, it’s harder to keep control of the desert hinterlands, but who cares about those? Empty places of no account. Meanwhile, in the empty places, a young warrior plods on camelback through endless sands under the white and bloodthirsty sun.\nEvery rotor is reactionary. The stages it introduces between the on and off positions of the binary automaton are the stages of decadence and decline. An energetic charge burning through its own filament. You can see this in the anacyclotic rotor of Polybius, a rotor so primitive it’s essentially just three binary automata strapped together. The best man in any society will inevitably become its king; after three generations his heirs forget their virtue and monarchy switches into tyranny. The best men in the society band together and overthrow the tyrant; since monarchy was too fragile they rule collectively; after three generations their heirs have forgotten their virtue and aristocracy collapses into oligarchy. The good citizens suffer under the oligarchs until it finally becomes unbearable and they overthrow them; they decide hereditary power is always unjust and set up a democracy; after three generations absolutely everyone has forgotten their virtue and society collapses, at which point the survivors pick the lest debased among them to be their king. Through each microcycle the circle of corruption expands. First one man, then many, then everyone, until there’s only one man untouched.\nThe grandest, most intricate, and most reactionary rotor is obviously the one laid out by Oswald Spengler in The Decline of the West. Spengler identifies seven distinct revolutions of his rotor over the course of world history. These are what he calls the Egyptian, Apollonian, Magian, Faustian, Indian, and Chinese cultures. At the core of each culture is what Spengler calls a world-feeling, by which he obviously means vibe; a culture is born when ‘a great soul awakens out of the proto­spirituality of ever-childish humanity, and de­taches itself, a form from the formless.’ This vibe settles over a group of people and starts to express itself through them. The vibe that became Egyptian culture was a sense of the past, the swallowing hugeness of time. Out of that vibe you get monumental stone architecture built to last forever with mummified kings inside, preserved for their long voyage through immortality. In Apollonian or classical culture the vibe is all about the sensuous immediacy of the present. Its characteristic form is nude marble sculpture: intense attention to the individual human body. ‘Never in Corinth or Athens or Sicyon do we find a landscape with mountain horizon and driving clouds and distant towns; every vase-painting has the same constituents, figures of Euclidean separateness and artistic self-sufficiency.’ The Magian culture—a fun invention combining late Rome, early Christianity, classical Persia, Judaism, and Islam—springs out of the sense of reality as a dimly lit ‘World-Cavern’ in which we’re all hunched.\nThis is weird, but it’s not important. Ultimately, what matters is less the vibe itself and more the vibe shifts it undergoes. Every culture starts ‘young and trembling,’ still haunted by the monsters of childhood, ‘all the dark and daemonic in itself and in nature.’ The Old Kingdom of Egypt, the Homeric epics in Greece, the Vedas in India, the fractured bones of the Shang dynasty in China, the Gospels and Apocalypses of the Magians, the Gothic mode in Europe. From there it grows into self-confident youth: pyramids, Doric temples, the Upanishads, the early Zhou, the great theological councils, the Renaissance. When it reaches maturity there’s usually some great conceptual achievement, the vibe fully realising itself in thought. Socrates, the Buddha, Confucius and Laozi, Mohammed, the Enlightenment. That’s the high point: it’s all downhill from there. Culture becomes intellectualised and abstracted; it still repeats its previous forms, but in a less and less organic and vibey way. It’s become ungrounded. In the last stage before it dies, a culture ossifies into a civilisation, which is universal and all-encompassing because it lacks any other qualities. For Hegel the universal is the telos of history; for Spengler it’s the death-knell. Lifeless and deformed new ideologies, the corpse-form of the original vibe: Stoicism, Buddhism, Chinese Legalism, socialism. ‘Finally, there arises the monstrous symbol and vessel of the completely emancipated intellect, the world-city.’ Babylon, Rome, New York: the horror.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a lot of fun, Spengler’s little spinning machine. It has a lot of potential for schizo charts like the one above. It’s obviously very stupid and full of obscene cultural essentialisms, but since we’re talking about vibes here that’s probably inevitable. Spengler’s motivations are pretty transparent: every monstrous late form is really just a cipher for the shameless gays of Weimar Germany. He created a whole theory of history so he could claim that the creative explosion happening around him didn’t actually count. (His notion of decline is very idiosyncratic: he thinks Chinese culture was entirely extinct by the early Han dynasty; the death of Magian culture is placed exactly halfway through what we call the Islamic Golden Age.) I think the most potent critique, though, is that this system is not actually as fun or complex as it could be.\nImagine the deranged system of gears you could come up with by modelling how all these different cycles interact. What happens in the contact-zone between a youthful world-cavern vibe and a declining world-garden vibe? Because that’s what happened when the first Nestorians arrived in Chang’an. You’d need a whole new set of schizo charts. But Spengler won’t do it. He insists that ‘ the history of humanity has no meaning whatever and deep significances reside only in the life-courses of the separate Cultures. Their inter-relations are unimportant and accidental.’ There is no general history, just a soupy haze of spinning rotors. The notion of a general history is a provincial product of just one of those rotors, the Western culture, with its vibe of infinite space and time. Spengler thinks he’s performed a Copernican revolution in history; in fact he’s just switched one of his rotors for another. The Indian culture, he writes, has dreamy, soupy, ahistorical vibes. ‘No history, no life-memories, no care. The millennium of the Indian culture between the Vedas and Buddha seems like the stirrings of a sleeper; here life was actually a dream.’ The great symbol in the Indian culture is the turning wheel. It makes sense that this would end up filtering into the grand structure of the book: Spengler poached his whole vibe from Nietzsche, who poached it from Schopenhauer, who poached it from the Hindu and Buddhist classics. Hegel made a place in his system for his own philosophy, but Hegel was a much more subtle thinker than Spengler. The theory of cultural lifecycles is not supposed to contain itself; if it does, it’s only a symptom.\nThis is the secret of all rotors: over time, the mechanism wears down. Just like the vibes produced by the binary automata, they don’t quite fit right in the world. But the people who love to play with rotors are so wrapped up in their game that they assume that what’s wearing down is the world itself, and not their favourite toy.\n3. The Jacquard device\nA Jacquard device is an elaborated rotor that tries to prevent this degradation by switching between states in a non-linear order. Unlike binary automata and rotors, which use their own outputs as inputs, Jacquard devices produce a series of vibes based on an external algorithm, which is slotted like a punch card into the device.\nThere is one really major Jacquard device, which is astrology, in which the algorithm powering the vibe-machine is the entire cosmos. Before people started asking you your sun sign on a first date, before it was all about the individual personality, the stars governed questions of statecraft and destiny. Astrological systems generate the terrestrial vibe in its entirety; farmers and kings would consult astrologers to learn if the vibes were right for planting wheat or starting wars. The main element in the system is a toroidal disc extending around a thousand light years into interstellar space. This disc is divided into twelve regions, each of which generates a distinct vibe. The actual qualities of each vibe are determined by the sector’s polarity (positive or negative), modality (cardinal, fixed, or mutable), and element (earth, water, fire, air). My sun sign, Virgo, is a negative mutable earth sign; its vibe is introspective rather than active, practical rather than passionate, grounded, critical, detail-oriented. The sun moves through these regions in two distinct cycles. The first is a regular, programmatic cycle across the calendar year, allowing each vibe in turn to wash over the earth. The sun is in Virgo during the start of the academic year, when the fury of summer (Leo: positive, fixed, fire) has died down and it’s time to get back to work.\nIn the second cycle, the sun moves backwards through the disc over a ‘Great Year’ lasting 25,772 ordinary years. The world was last ruled by Virgo between 13,000 BC and 10,750 BC, which would have presumably been an age of critical, practical, detail-oriented Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. The most recent change was around 1 AD, when we moved from the age of Aries (positive, cardinal, fire; aggression and arrogance, restlessness; the great and brutal Bronze Age empires, their collapse, and the new and brutal empires of iron that followed) to Pisces (negative, mutable, water; aloofness and intellectualism, compassion tinged with self-regard; the grand sweep from Christianity to liberalism). This system really does work. It’s just a bit dull.\nSun-sign astrology is the most popular and accessible register, but as a vibe machine it’s limited: one spinning wheel, one fixed point, repeating the same programme over and over again. Astrology opens things up through the planets, which dart unpredictably across the wheel, directing cosmic vibes to particular areas of human life. The individual positions of the planets are significant; so are the aspects, the relations between those positions. On Inauguration Day, for instance, Jupiter—the king-star, seat of power—was in Gemini: positive, mutable, air. Gemini’s vibe is playful, effervescent; it’s the sign of ironic doubling; you know it’s all hollow, but you can’t help playing along. Donald Trump is a Gemini. Jupiter’s been up there ever since last summer, when it left Taurus: negative, fixed, earth; stubborn, stupid. Almost immediately, Joe Biden dropped out. But look at the other planets. In 2020, Jupiter and Saturn formed a Great Conjunction in Aquarius, the first time they’d appeared together in an air sign for two centuries. This was the end of the earth era, the age of struggles over the means of production, which has lasted from Charles Fourier to Bernie Sanders. Suddenly everyone was talking about vibes. But now Saturn, which governs law and responsibility, is in Pisces: square to Jupiter, at right angles across the zodiac. Squared planets are in friction, straining against each other. Power opposes law, which is why the new Trumpian vibe has such an illicit feel. It’s great fun to be able to say retard again, but behind it all you are aware of the presence of a great and terrible crime. Meanwhile Mercury, lord of flight and messages, ruler of Gemini, and Trump’s patron deity, is in Capricorn, sextile to Saturn. When planets are sextile, this indicates an easy and unrestricted flow of vibes between them. In the moment of Trump’s triumph, his own deity chose law over loyalty. Ever since the inauguration, planes have been falling out of the sky all over the United States, one after another. This doesn’t seem like a great augur for the new regime.\nThe other major Jacquard device is the fractal chronology of the rogue seventeenth-century rabbi Gershon of Pinsk. Rabbi Gershon’s device is also a linear sequence of stages; unlike astrology, it has no other moving parts. His innovation was to nest the machine inside itself.\nThe algorithm for his fractal chronology is the Hebrew creation myth. In Psalm 90, Moses addresses God: ‘A thousand years in Thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.’ Traditionally, Talmudists have taken this to mean that history will last for six thousand years, mirroring the six days of creation, with the age of the Messiah corresponding to the seventh day in which God rested. Gershon took this idea much more seriously than his contemporaries. The world, he reasoned, is not just a mirror of the act of creation; those six days form the substance of all material reality. Therefore, if we look at the history of the world, we should find that it precisely mirrors the sequence of the first chapter of Genesis. And when he looked, he found that it did. This is his sequence of world history:\n\nThe first day: ‘Let there be light.’ AM 1-1000 (3760-2760 BC). The generations of Adam. God is present as the residue of His great light upon the earth. Ends between the death of Adam (930) and the birth of Noah (1056). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe second day: ‘Let there be an expanse in the midst of the water, and let it be a separation between water and water.’ AM 1000-2000 (2760-1760 BC). Separation between the just and the wicked. The age of the great Flood (1656) and the confusion of the tongues at Babel (1757). God appears not as a light, but as the fury of the great waters. Ends with the birth of Abraham (1948). Much suffering; God saw that this, too, was good.\n\nThe third day: ‘Let the water that is beneath the heavens gather into one place, and let the dry land appear.’ AM 2000-3000 (1760-760 BC). God makes his covenant with Abraham (2018), gives the Law to Moses (2448), establishes David as King over Israel (2892), and ordains the First Temple (2928). Here He appears as a firm bond, solid ground, the Rock of Zion. Ends with the death of Solomon and the rupturing of the kingdom (2964). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe fourth day: ‘Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens.’ AM 3000-4000 (760 BC-240 AD). Proliferation of powers, princes, and foreign empires, all given power over the land of Israel. Exile and devastation by the Assyrians under Tiglath-Pileser (3187) and Sennacherib (3213), the Babylonians under Nebuchadnezzar (3338), the Greeks under Antiochus (3593) and the Romans (3829). Here God is distant as the stars, but speaks through a diffusion of prophets. Ends with the completion of the Mishnah (3949). God is terrible in justice and all His deeds are good.\n\nThe fifth day: ‘Let the waters swarm a swarming of living creatures, and let fowl fly over the earth, across the expanse of the heavens; let the earth bring forth living creatures, cattle and creeping things and the beasts of the earth.’ AM 4000-5000 (240-1240 AD). Again a great diffusion of forms. Rise of the Notzrim and Yishmaelim. The Jewish people disperse among the swarming of new nations. Here God is a whirlwind. Still the earth brings forth great teachers: the Geonim, Rashi, the Rambam. Ends with the death of the Rambam (4965). God saw that it was good.\n\nThe sixth day: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness, and they shall rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the heaven and over the animals.’ AM 5000-6000 (1240-2240 AD). Through the dispersal and fracturing of the earth, what is good has been spread over the entire earth; now it rises in the luminous shape of a man. The age that will see the coming of the Messiah. Here God appears with a human face, and all nations will know Him. May he see that it is good.\nHistory is a series of discrete stages: a fading fire, a watery division, an earthly reunification, a sidereal scattering, an aerial sundering, and finally a single fiery thread that completes the cycle. But Rabbi Gershon wasn’t satisfied with plotting the course of world history. Since the entire universe is made out of this sequence, it should reproduce itself in any period of time, however arbitrary. And it does. A human life follows the exact same sequence. First you’re brought into the light of creation. When you’re young you’re tempestuous; you want to distinguish yourself, divide the world into I and not-I. Once childhood is over you start to seek out a solid ground for yourself. As you get older your strength fails, your troubles grow, you become weak—until, as an old man, you find wisdom, which is the intellectual form of the Messiah. A day passes in the same way. First a fading light (the Jewish day begins at sunset), then the division between soul and body during sleep, then the firm purpose of the morning drifting into the listlessness of the afternoon. So does a year. (The Jewish year starts and ends in early autumn.) Therefore, two things are simultaneously true. Firstly, that the world is still uncreated, and God will not have created the world until it ends. Secondly, that the world has already ended, and the Messianic age is now. It was for that second conclusion that Rabbi Gershon was excommunicated as a heretic by the Council of Four Lands. His intricate spiderweb diagrams, showing how every age of human history sits inside every other, were piled up and burned.\nIn his later tractates, Rabbi Gershon wrote that the reason the smallest possible unit of time is shaped like the entire history of the Universe is that his six-stage process ultimately describes not the act of creation but the fundamental quality of time. He imagines the smallest possible unit of time, experiencing it languidly, as if it were a day. At first the moment is solid, contemporaneous to itself, a burst of light, but to become duration it has to wrench itself apart, separating past from future. The solid ground of the present moment forms between these poles, but as soon as it arrives it instantly starts to disintegrate. But finally, just before the moment fades, it comes to know itself. The rush of what is becomes the consciousness of what was; in that fraction of an instant everything achieves its resurrection and is raised out of time and into the mind of God.\nOther, more minor Jacquard devices include liberalism, cliodynamics, and historical materialism.\n4. The monotonic escalator\nJacquard devices are, obviously, a hybrid form: they are vibe-machines that run on something other than vibes. This protects them from the degeneration that seems to afflict all cyclical machines, but at the cost of muddying the signal. As critics of astrology have pointed out, the system is arbitrary enough that you can plausibly explain any vibe by reference to any arrangement of the stars; meanwhile Rabbi Gershon’s fractal history implies that all vibes are actually running on full power at every point in time. The monotonic (or negentropic) escalator avoids all these problems by removing the need for a succession of vibes. On the monotropic model, there’s actually just a single vibe, which is continually self-reinforcing through feedback mechanisms. This buildup of vibe is mathematically predictable on a long enough scale, but it’s not always perfectly smooth: vibe is a compressible fluid, and it can squeeze into tight reservoirs until it reaches maximum density and bursts out of its container. This is what we experience as a vibe shift; really, it’s just the continual intensification of the univibe.\nWe’ve already encountered one monotonic escalator, which is Hegel’s theory of history, in which the constantly intensifying vibe is freedom. There are others. Unfortunately, no monotonic escalator has conclusively been shown to exist.\nFor a while, the best candidate was the global economic escalator identified by György Lerner in 1959. Lerner was an economist at the University of Cambridge, and the leading authority in the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era, mostly because he was the only authority on the econometrics of the Palaeolithic era. Before the escalator, his major contribution was a 1955 study demonstrating the existence of a fluctuating inflation rate in small ceremonial arrowheads across fifty thousand years of prehistory. Lerner used Cambridge’s EDSAC computer to process data from Stone Age grave sites into a reasonably complex model of the prehistoric economy. He was the first to assign a per capita GDP rate to the Creswellian culture, which was eleven pounds and six shillings in mammoth-ivory rods. He examined the structural causes underlying the collapse of the European amber bead market in 16,000 BC. (Overproduction, low market transparency.) But his breakthrough came when he started trying to investigate prehistoric economic growth.\nAll this work took place during the most intense phase of the Great Acceleration. In 1959, the global population was very nearly three billion. This was up from two billion in 1927. It had taken 123 years to get there from 1804, when the population was one billion; reaching that first billion had taken roughly three hundred thousand years. Since 1804, the world economy had doubled in size nearly four times, faster and faster; it had taken pre-industrial civilisations five thousand years to do the same. At the time, the consensus was that something had happened. Some break with the general pattern of history. For most of human history, almost everyone who lived was living in miserable poverty, three steps away from starvation. Humans were like rabbits, their numbers kept in check by famine or disease. But after the Industrial Revolution things were suddenly different. Humanity had escaped the Malthusian trap.\nLerner’s investigations showed something else. Malthus had been wrong from the start. Economic and population growth during the early Stone Age was extremely slow, between 0.01% for the Gravettian culture and 0.02% for the Magdalenian; it took around five thousand years for the Palaeolithic economy to double in size. But the Palaeolithic lasted for a very long time, which meant there were enough of these doublings for Lerner to notice that their rate was very, very slowly accelerating. Stone Age man was already on the long lower slopes of the exponential curve that would take him into modernity. If the Magdalenian culture had econometrists, scratching their calculations into elk antlers with a piece of flint, passing them down through the generations, the flows of amber beads and ivory rods would have told them that the world was growing geometrically. By the nineteenth century, its doubling time would be shorter than a human lifespan. In the twentieth century, it would achieve liftoff. They wouldn’t have been able to conceive of the particulars: steam power, electricity, the atom. But the trajectory was absolutely fixed from the start.\nLerner wasn’t particularly interested in what his monotonic escalator said about the future; his main interest was in the economic analysis of prehistoric middens. But it did make other people quite excited. If we’re on a hyperbolic curve, then around one-quarter of the way through the twenty-first century, the world will become infinitely large. There will be infinitely many people, with infinite resources, infinitely technologically advanced. What would that even look like? In the face of the curve we’re all cavemen trying to imagine the nuclear bomb. Unlike the cavemen, Lerner’s contemporaries weren’t protected by the thick wadding of time. Their world would go infinite in roughly sixty-six years.\nIt’s now 2025, the year the line goes vertical, and the line will not be going vertical. Essentially from the moment Lerner identified his escalator, the exponential growth started, almost imperceptibly, to slow. But it’s perceptible now. By the end of the twenty-first century, world population will start to shrink. People used to panic about overpopulation; now they panic about demographic collapse. Advanced economies are stagnating; third-world growth engines have started faltering too. There are some new headline-grabbing technologies, but instead of opening up new fields of human potential their main utility seems to be making it easier to run various sinister online scams. At some point between 1959 and 2025, the monotonic escalator that had been running for three hundred thousand years suddenly stalled.\nThere are two explanations. The first is that the escalator never really existed. Instead, what Lerner had identified was one phase of an incredibly slow binary automaton. For three hundred thousand years, this automaton had been producing its 1-vibe, which had something to do with increase and expansion. The vibe was on for so long that we’d confused it for a static fact about human life. Clearly this vibe machine operates on a geological or cosmological timescale; the same vibe that produced the age of exponential growth might also be responsible for the sun and the stars; the automaton’s first flick might have been what caused the Big Bang. But now it’s stretched almost as far as it can go, and it’s twanging back into its opposite. It’s hard to say exactly what the 0-vibe might be like, since the 1-vibe contains all of human history. Is this what killed the dinosaurs? Maybe. But the vibe that’s ushered in the second Donald Trump era might be our first clue, the first thing to fully express this fat, hot, decaying new world. Somewhere in the weird morass of feelings that generated the inauguration is the secret to our next million years.\nThat’s the first explanation. The second is that Hegel was wrong, and whatever it is that generates the vibe does not want to be known. The monotonic escalator was real—but only until György Lerner identified it, at which point it vanished. Whenever the vibe is fully identified, a vibe shift takes place. Which keeps us all very busy, watching this strange new vibe as it upends our world, coming up with annoying new opinions about it, arguing over where the vibes come from or whether the vibes even exist—so busy we don’t notice, in the gutters of Washington DC, the quick movements of some scaly creature, author of all our desires and misfortunes, as it scurries hastily into the gloom.\n\n\n\n\nRead the room",

There&#8217;s diamonds in there, huge seams of copper and zinc, rare earth metals, the wealth of a small continent, and all of it is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick. You can&#8217;t build on the ice and you can&#8217;t dig through it either, because the ice is not static. Not glassy and smooth but jagged, rucked up everywhere with jostling peaks, and it flows: every part of the ice sheet is slowly spreading out of the centre of the island and into the sea. Any permanent structure you try to build there will end up on an iceberg, dissolving in the Atlantic. If you try to dig through the ice and into the mineral-rich rock beneath, three trillion tons of creaking, patient ice will crush your borehole and snap your drills like matchsticks. The ice is empty. Animals don&#8217;t go there. There&#8217;s nothing to eat, this far from the sea, where the ground never thaws. Not even rocks to nuzzle for lichen. Some ice worms that scrub the red algae off the glaciers, but nothing desperate enough to feed on them. Humans don&#8217;t go there either. A few scientific research stations that sprout up for three months before being dismantled again. The US military built a base on the ice once to store their missiles, but they felt the ground moving, closing around their silos, ready to pop the nuclear warheads like bubble wrap, and the base was abandoned. A few explorers and adventurers are buried in there, slowly crushed between groaning walls of ice. All of Greenland&#8217;s original settlements are on the thin rind of exposed rock around the edge. You can fish there. For a few months in the summer you can grow potatoes in the thin acidic soil. No one lives on the ice. But there&#8217;s someone on the ice.</p><p>The first documented encounter with the icedwellers was filmed by Jaxon Flores, an American settler, just outside his homestead above Qikangittuqaqquti on the edge of the ice. Flores had, like half a million Americans, moved to the new unincorporated federal territory of Greenland under the Second Frontier programme. Footage captured from his livestream shows Flores on the ice. It&#8217;s night; it&#8217;s been night for weeks. He&#8217;s standing in front of a ring light, and the crags and spears of ice behind him glow semitransparent, like a world of jagged glass. Flores wears a black parka and repeatedly hits a vape pen as he talks to his phone. STOP BEING GAY, he says. Literally bro just stop being gay, he says, I literally don&#8217;t know how else to put it, you are gay. Your ancestors, your ancestors&#8212;he sucks on the vape&#8212;your ancestors carved a society out of the wilderness. Your ancestors were <em>men</em>. They went to the desert and tamed it, they fought savage tribes, they fought literal fuckin demons to build the modern world. They reaped the fruits of civilisation because they&#8217;d earned it. How do you think your ancestors would feel to see you eating processed slop and fapping to pornography? If you&#8217;re not already in Greenland, if you&#8217;re still in Fake America&#8212;a huge cloud of vapour freezing to tiny crystals as he exhales&#8212;you&#8217;re not gonna make it bro. Here he spreads his arms wide at the black desert around him. There&#8217;s no laws! he shouts. No laws here, no taxes, it&#8217;s just men, real men, building a new society in Hyperborea. You could be minting crypto here bro, you could be running cams, you could be doing shit that would get you a fucking jail sentence in Fake America. Right now I&#8217;m building <em>generational wealth</em>. In like sixty years when the ice melts and they find gold my great grandkids will be trillionaires. I did that. And instead you&#8217;re saving for a down payment for a studio in Miami to party with females, because you&#8212;and here Flores leans in close to the camera until you can see the ice glittering in his eyelashes&#8212;are gay.</p><p>In addition to his mandatory homestead, Flores had bought twenty plots of Greenland ice shelf during the initial government auction. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his daily streams from the middle of the wilderness. He had failed to sell a single plot. In the darkness behind him the ice gurgled and whined. Sounds like rubber stretching, like steel twisting, like a gasp from the bottom of the world. </p><p>The footage shows Flores continuing to speak for another hour. He answers questions from his chat. He talks about how much money he&#8217;s making. At 1:13:22, the lighting behind him changes; some of the shards of ice appear to be lit by a faint, local orange glow. At 1:15:09, Flores stops talking and stares at the camera. Yeah yeah, he says, nice try. He stares silently at a point directly below the camera for twelve more seconds. Fuck you, he says, there&#8217;s no one behind me. But he turns around and looks anyway, and then suddenly ducks down. For just under two seconds the footage captures what looks like a human shape on a ridge of ice, but taller and more massive than any man, holding a smouldering clump of dried heather in one enormous hand. Then the light vanishes and we are very close to Flores&#8217; face, lit only by the glow from his screen. Yo, he hoots, yoooo. From its peaks of ice the visitor responds. Its voice is high and loud, strained, nasal, more like the scream of a bird of prey than anything human. <em>EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH</em>, it says. The footage ends. </p><div><hr></div><p>In 1722, the Twin Realms of Denmark-Norway established the first modern European colony on the island of Greenland, with a mission to secure its waters for Danish-Norwegian whalers, and to establish contact with the survivors from the old Norse settlement, first established seven hundred years previously. There was a lot of speculation about those settlers, who would have spent generations completely isolated from their cousins in Europe. They wouldn&#8217;t know about the Protestant reformation or the rediscovery of America or that the Earth revolved around the Sun. They would still be stuck in Catholicism, or maybe they&#8217;d reverted back to the worship of the pagan gods, Thor and Odin, or whatever new deities bubbled out the swamps of this heathen land on the edge of the world. The colonists arrived to find that no one was there. They landed at the Eystribyg&#240;, where there should have been farms of fat sheep and monasteries and Brattahl&#237;&#240;, the grand estate of Erik the Red, and all that remained was a pile of stones that had once been a church. In the hills around the ruin skulked the Skr&#230;lingar, the people of dried pelts and bone-tipped spears. </p><p>Eventually the colony&#8217;s pastor, an excitable young man called Jens M&#229;skesen, managed to learn enough Inuit to speak to them. They told him that they were not the first people to come to Greenland, but when they arrived the place was already populated by the nujaqaqut, or the hairy ones. The nujaqaqut were described as tall, broad men with light-coloured hair. When the Inuit arrived the nujaqaqut were living on the coast, but they had fought and now they lived in the interior, on the ice. M&#229;skesen concluded that these must be the Vikings he was looking for, mounted an expedition into the icy interior of Greenland, and was never seen again.</p><p>He&#8217;d learned some of his hosts&#8217; vocabulary, but not the grammar. Inuit languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns; the animate form would be <em>nujaqaqtut</em>. These were not men.</p><p>Six months later, a ship from Denmark stopped at the colony with a replacement pastor. August Risle was a man of the Enlightenment: a philologist, a vermeologist, a proto-anthropologist, and an inventor of small but vicious devices. He had spent two years in Lapland learning about the lives of the Lapps, two years in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals learning about the lives of the Kaluks, and one year in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals desperately trying to get back over the Urals and go home. In Greenland, Risle took a far more systematic approach than his predecessor. He didn&#8217;t just learn passable Inuit; he learned to canoe, he accompanied his Inuit hosts on seal-hunting trips, he learned about their religion, in which everything that breathes is a part of the sky, and he witnessed their funerals, in which the dead are wrapped in a sealskin shroud and buried under the sea ice. </p><p>There were a lot of funerals; one by one his hosts were dying of smallpox. Despite this, Risle never gave his hosts the other thing that Europeans were busy spreading to every new population they encountered, which was Christianity. He let them keep their sky thick with souls. He let them believe the winds were made of the dead and the unborn, and the stronger bodiless spirits out there, like Saampu who comes in nightmares to chase you with his black teeth. He let them die unsaved. But before the surviving Inuit fled the new Danish settlement, he found out about the nujaqaqut, the hairy ones. The Inuit told him that just like there could be breath without body, sometimes there were bodies without breath. Every person breathes a part of the wind, and all the animals they have to hunt, and even rocks and plants, but not the nujaqaqut, who are shaped like men but have no souls. Because they&#8217;re made of leftover body, they can wear the signs of any animal. All of them are covered from head to foot in white hair like a bear, but some of them have antlers too, or a pair of walrus tusks. They have terrible fangs. They live on the ice but come near human settlements at night, to steal Inuit men and women and feast on their flesh. The nujaqaqut are not the old Viking settlers. The nujaqaqut are what ate them.</p><p>Risle concluded that the Norse settlement had probably collapsed due to changes in the climate and struggles with the Inuit. The nujaqaqut, he wrote, were how the Inuit, who had some intelligence, expressed their own condition. They could feel that their souls belonged to the infinite sky, but their material lives were miserable, cold, savage, and impoverished, and this fundamental fact of life on the pole was given form as the man-eating nujaqaqut. In such a desolate place, cannibalism was probably not unknown. Risle never thought about the monsters again. The rest of his time in Greenland was devoted to his real passion, the study of worms. Feeding the local earthworms into one of his own little rotating contraptions, which slowly peeled an earthworm until it was a large square sheet of weeping, semitransparent slime.</p><p>Maybe he should have looked a little harder. According to the Saga of the Greenlanders, &#8216;learned men say that in the summer in which Erik set out to settle Greenland, thirty-five<sup> </sup>ships sailed out of Brei&#240;afj&#246;r&#240;ur and Borgarfj&#246;r&#240;ur; fourteen of these arrived there safely, some were driven back and some were lost, and one arrived but the crew were lost to the n&#225;ttskr&#230;kja.&#8217; <em>N&#225;ttskr&#230;kja</em> means night-screecher. It&#8217;s not clear what this refers to, but presumably the saga&#8217;s audience would have known. What it ultimately means is that when Erik first came to Greenland, there was already someone on the ice. </p><p>Across the two hundred-odd years of Danish sovereignty in Greenland, settlers had a habit of disappearing, like Jens M&#229;skesen, off the edge of the ice sheet. There are empty graves up and down the coast. But Greenland is a dangerous country, and the numbers were too small to notice. Strange things kept happening after 1940, when the United States took over effective governorship of the island. The Americans built military bases, airstrips, radar stations, listening posts, missile silos. For a while, one of the tallest manmade structures on the planet was an American military radio tower in Greenland. All of this was secret; the Greenlanders had no idea what was happening in their country. The Danes still paid for fishing ports and housing projects and pretended the place was theirs, but America had the crown of the world, peering over the pole and into Russia: this unearthly island, halfway into outer space. The soldiers were uneasy there. Every few years, when the nights dragged on for weeks, someone disappeared. In 1971, the guns at Thule Air Base fired continuously into the ice for three hours. Helicopters were sent up to strafe the surrounding fjords. Artillery shells burst into the glaciers. Afterwards, the Air Force was unable to explain exactly what had happened. All they knew was that they&#8217;d come under attack. Not the Soviets. Something in the night.</p><p>If the military knew what it was that attacked them, they didn&#8217;t say. It was easy to keep secrets in the north. Or it was until 2025, when President Trump, who never had any patience for subtext, decided to get rid of the useful fiction in which Greenland was still an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, and half a million American settlers spread out over the ice.</p><div><hr></div><p>The Greenland PD found Jaxon Flores smeared across the surface of the glacier like a burst fly. A month later something attacked a homestead near Quviananngit. Gnaw marks on the bones. In the northeast corner of the island a shell corporation was operating a gladiatorial arena, fights to the death livestreamed back to the mainland. The last few frames before the feed cut out showed an enormous nude figure as it burst screeching through the wall, seized one of the combatants by his head, and bounced him against the floor like a basketball. In the first two years of mass American settlement in Greenland, at least eighteen Second Frontierspeople were killed in similar attacks. Two and a half years after the death of Jaxon Flores, someone finally managed to take down a nujaqaq.</p><p>The attack took place at Hyperborea Two, a neo-Nazi compound in the south of the island. Hyperborea Two was the home of the Origins Movement, led by Fred McIntosh, who had been a promising research chemist until 1986, when he decided to devote himself entirely to the idea that the ancestors of the white race had come to Earth from the star Alpha Tauri, and their original home on this planet had been a now-vanished temperate continent covering the North Pole. McIntosh taught that the Neanderthals were a race of extraterrestrial Aryan supermen, and their diminished descendants could reactivate their Neanderthal genes through exposure to the Northern Lights. Like most American settlements, Hyperborea Two sustained itself by taking advantage of Greenland&#8217;s lax legal regime; they&#8217;d built a lab out on the ice, which they were using to produce generic versions of prescription drugs, which they then sold online. Originally the lab was set up to manufacture opiates, benzos, and amphetamines; their bestselling product ended up being aripiprazole, an antipsychotic. In the middle of the night&#8212;it&#8217;s always night&#8212;a figure leaped out of the ice with an unearthly high-pitched scream and tore two armed guards gorily in two. Inside the compound, it ripped through two more Nazis in short order. It was shot in the leg, the shoulder, and the hip without slowing down. A gunshot directly to the head failed to kill it. Finally, one of the Nazis put a round directly through the intruder&#8217;s eye, and it collapsed. They posted a photo online, the surviving cultists posing behind the corpse like they&#8217;d brought down a buck. Two of them holding up Black Sun flags. McIntosh himself in the middle, gripping an AR-15 tight with his leathery, palsied hands. The nujaqaq lay on its side, all eight feet of it, naked, head lolling, one sightless eye pointed at nothing, one a dried-up wound, with black trails of blood matting the thick white hair that covered every inch of its body.</p><p>The body was seized by the GPD and handed over to federal authorities. Genomic analysis revealed that what the Origins Movement had killed was, in fact, an Aryan superman. Mitochondrial DNA revealed that around 1% of the ice monster&#8217;s ancestry was shared by populations in Iceland and Denmark. The <em>most</em> genetically similar sample overall, though, came from a 38,000-year-old bone found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia. It had belonged to a Neanderthal. </p><p>It took a long time to find one alive on the ice. Drones with thermal cameras fanned out over Greenland, searching for wandering bands of nujaqaqut, and found nothing. The nujaqaqut don&#8217;t travel in bands. Their thick fur means their bodies barely lose any heat. They looked for signs of habitation, but the nujaqaqut don&#8217;t build shelters. What they did find was shit, the huge warm logs the nujaqaqut left in crevasses of the ice. Follow the shit, and eventually you&#8217;ll find the shitter. The US military tracked a juvenile male as he plodded south across the wilderness, heading towards the homestead of a sports betting website. Before the creature could start mauling the bookies, a strike team helidropped onto the ice to detain it. Getting the nujaqaq into captivity was a brutal, screeching struggle; once locked up at an Air Force facility in Nuuk, though, it was almost embarrassingly docile. It didn&#8217;t froth or try to break out of its cell; its calm, quiet gaze was mostly drawn to electric lights. Like a newborn baby. It shrieked and howled when it saw its captors, but without aggression. MRI scans showed that whatever was happening in its head, the nujaqaq vocal tract only allowed a very limited level of voice modulation; these nasal screams were the closest it could get to language. But there didn&#8217;t seem to be much happening in its head either. The nujaqaq passed the mirror test, but it wouldn&#8217;t look its captors in the face. Attempts to teach it sign language were a dismal failure. The creature just sat calmly and quietly, and its cold blue eyes watched the moving fingers as if they were eddies of ice twisting in the wind. It inhabited a world without meaning. </p><p>But it was very good at puzzles. The researchers tried a game that offered the nujaqaq a small morsel of food if it could press four coloured buttons in a particular sequence. It could remember a sequence of four. It could remember a series of forty. It could remember a sequence of four hundred. They tried presenting it with increasingly complicated mazes, but it always went for the optimal route without any apparent effort. They gave it a Rubik&#8217;s cube, which it solved instantly, but once it became clear that there wasn&#8217;t any food inside it showed no interest in solving any of the other, larger cubes it was offered. They tried the memory game again, but this time with numbers instead of colours. Then they tried teaching it basic addition and subtraction, which it took to almost immediately. When a piece of hamburger was on offer, the nujaqaq could multiply twelve-digit integers in its head. A few days later, having burned through everything in their library, the researchers tried giving it the P versus NP problem. The next morning, the nujaqaq had produced eight dense pages demonstrating that P did, in fact, equal NP. Any problem that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Just not by you.</p><div><hr></div><p><em>From a special hearing on the nujaqaqtut by the Joint Congressional Committee on Greenland.</em></p><p>SENATOR &#8216;JUMPING&#8217; JIM SCHPULTZ (R-WY): Ms Rao, just to make sure i&#8217;ve got this right&#8212;when you introduced yourself earlier, you said you were the CTO of Telperion, Inc., which is a technology services firm based out of Mountain View, California?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: That&#8217;s correct.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: And you sell&#8212;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: We partner with clients including the federal government to deliver bespoke solutions for the data problems of tomorrow.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you are not a biologist.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I am not.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Did you minor in biology? AP biology, perhaps?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: My background is in computer science, Senator. I don&#8217;t see&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Forgive me. I just find it strange, Ms Rao, that you say you&#8217;re not a biologist, but at the same time you&#8217;ve here to tell us that these, uh, nujaqaqs are human beings. </p><p>ANANYA RAO: I&#8217;m sorry, but I find your insinuation here incredibly offensive.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: I&#8217;m not insinuating anything, I&#8217;m only trying to see&#8212;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Not so long ago, Senator, this very body held that some people were only three-fifths of a human being. Because of the way they looked and the way they spoke, because they looked different&#8212;respectfully, Senator, because they looked different to white men like yourself. There is a shameful history in this country of dehumanisation and violence, and it&#8217;s especially shocking, Senator Schpultz, to hear someone revive that hateful language, here, in the twenty-first century. The genus and species of the nujaqaqtut are <em>Homo </em>and<em> sapiens</em>. That&#8217;s what the science says.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Ms Rao, this thing is eight feet tall and it eats raw meat. You&#8217;re telling me a Neanderthal is <em>Homo sapiens</em>?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: That&#8217;s what the science says. As far as I know, the law makes no distinction. Title 1 of the US Code says a human being is any member of the species <em>Homo sapiens</em> who is born alive. There&#8217;s no exception for <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em>. Senator, I&#8217;m not going to debate their humanity with you. They are as human as you or me, and according to the Greenland Annexation Act&#8212;which I remember <em>you</em> promoting as one of your proudest achievements&#8212;that means they&#8217;re fully entitled to live and work here, and to claim American citizenship if they want.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you&#8217;re not saying they&#8217;re human like you or me. You&#8217;re saying they&#8217;re some kind of <em>super</em>human.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I wouldn&#8217;t say that at all, no. We believe that all humans have an equal&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Your company says they&#8217;re smarter than us. Is that true?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: There&#8217;s no one measure of intelligence.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: It&#8217;s a yes or no answer.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: There&#8217;s a holistic, multidimensional&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: You&#8217;ve been testing them for <em>something</em>. Yes or no.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Yes. They&#8217;re smarter than us.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Care to put a number on it? Are we talking about an IQ of 200 here? 300?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Honestly, I can&#8217;t say. None of us are smart enough to come up with a test capable of measuring nujaqaq intelligence. Everything we make, they ace. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But you&#8217;re talking about a group that never invented writing, never invented the wheel&#8230;</p><p>ANANYA RAO: They need to be in the right environment. The nujaqaqtut find certain things harder than we do. They&#8217;re less social, they don&#8217;t work so collaboratively. All those brilliant minds were stuck in the Stone Age for two hundred thousand years. But we have the tools to help them realise their potential. There&#8217;s now a small colony of nujaqaqtut at the Air Force base in Nuuk that Telperion&#8217;s been working with. They can&#8217;t speak, but we&#8217;ve been teaching them to type. In fact, there&#8217;s a little girl there called Ada who wrote you a letter. I have it here.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Go ahead.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: She writes: Dear Senator &#8216;Jumping&#8217; Jim Schpultz, my name is Ada and I am four years old and I love you because you are a US Senator for the state of Wyoming and Wyoming is my favourite state because of all the states it&#8217;s the closest to being a perfect square which is my favourite shape. Colorado is also close to being a perfect square but Wyoming is closer than Colorado. Wyoming is defined by geodesics along 41&#176;N to 45&#176;N latitude and 104&#176;W to 111&#176;W longitude so its borders form a near-spherical quadrilateral however the Earth is not a perfect sphere so using the Vincenty formula on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid its north-south and east-west geodesic lengths are approximately 570.3 km and 444.4 km which means an aspect ratio of 1.28. Colorado&#8217;s aspect ratio is 1.36 which makes it less like a perfect square. However even though the meridional convergence at higher latitudes contributes to Wyoming&#8217;s lower aspect ratio Colorado&#8217;s angular excess on the WGS84 ellipsoid calculated with L&#8217;Huillier&#8217;s theorem is 0.38 while Wyoming&#8217;s angular excess is 2.35&#176; which means Wyoming has greater distortion on an ellipsoidal manifold and therefore Colorado is actually more like a square as plotted in Euclidean space. One day I want to visit Wyoming and see its famous sights which include Devil&#8217;s Tower National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Yours sincerely, Ada.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: That&#8217;s very sweet.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: Thank you. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: She sure sounds like a smart kid.</p><p>ANANYA RAO: She is.</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: But as sweet as your letter is, it&#8217;s not the only letter I&#8217;ve been receiving. See, I also got a letter from Dr Sarah Fang. Dr Fang is an anthropologist attached to the Air Force Culture and Language Center out of Maxwell AFB in Alabama, and the whole time you&#8217;ve been studying these nujaqaqs, she&#8217;s been studying them too. Unlike yourself, she can&#8217;t appear before this hearing, but she tells me that the, uh, cries and wails of these&#8212;let&#8217;s call them these <em>folks </em>you have there in Greenland&#8212;to the extent that they&#8217;re a language, it&#8217;s now been pretty well deciphered. Now you can call that little, that little <em>pup</em> you have&#8212;you can call her Ada if you want, but her mother never called her that. Dr Fang tells me that in the language she actually speaks, there&#8217;s no such thing as a name. They don&#8217;t have them. There&#8217;s also no words, she says, for &#8216;me&#8217; or &#8216;you.&#8217; Are you aware, Ms Rao, of any human languages that don&#8217;t have a word for &#8216;me&#8217; or &#8216;you&#8217;?</p><p>ANANYA RAO: I&#8217;m not a linguist. </p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: You&#8217;re not a linguist. Now, earlier, you said that the nujaqaqs don&#8217;t work as collaboratively as we do. Well, that&#8217;s one way of putting it. Dr Fang tells me the same thing. She says they have no form of social organisation whatsoever. They don&#8217;t have chiefs or leaders, they don&#8217;t have collective myths or narratives, they don&#8217;t build any kind of individual or collective dwellings, and they don&#8217;t have any concept at all of God. Even monkeys touch and groom each other, but not these fellas. They do not have such a thing as family. Once a child is weaned, the mother just abandons it on the ice. I reckon my dog is a better mother than that. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you might wonder how a species that hates its own kind so badly would even manage to survive so long. Well, in her report, Dr Fang explains it. Let me read here. In the absence of any stable mating or kinship structures, she writes, Nunjaqaq reproduction is achieved sporadically and opportunistically, almost exclusively through what our society would consider rape.</p><p><em>A murmur in the room. Whispers fluttering. The creak of seats.</em></p><p>ANANYA RAO: Senator, this is naked fearmongering. We&#8217;re talking about a situation&#8212;</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: Now, I understand that Telperion stands to make a lot of money from these nujaqaqs. You have your Big Tech shareholders to answer to, and that&#8217;s our American system. But I have my constituents. What am I supposed to say to the parents of a little girl who&#8217;s been raped by one of your pet geniuses? How am I supposed to comfort them when their little angel has been raped, savagely raped, and then not just killed, but killed and <em>eaten</em>? You are talking about introducing a population of <em>prehistoric predators</em> into our country. You want to bring these man-eating carnivores into our towns and cities, into our workplaces, into our schools. You say they&#8217;re entitled to be part of our American society. You say you&#8217;re not going to debate their humanity, but that&#8217;s exactly the debate we need to have. Now I reckon that if you don&#8217;t have any notion of a family, any notion of home, or any notion of God, that disqualifies you right there from being an American. And to be frank, if you go about buck naked and you live off human flesh, whatever you may be, it isn&#8217;t human. These are <em>wild animals</em>, and if you let them in here, they will do exactly what they did in the Pleistocene. They will rape, and they will kill, and they will eat. And I tell you now, Ms Rao, as God is my witness I am not going to let you or your monsters do that to any of my little girls.</p><p><em>Uproar. Four members of the Joint Committee start shouting at once. Members of the press rush towards the podium. A clamour from two of the other expert witnesses, objecting in the most strenuous possible terms. The Ambassador from Denmark is trying to bellow over everyone, mottled red and white and clammy like a slice of bacon. Another expert witness is rocking back and forth and giggling to himself. Beasts! he giggles. Beasts! Monsters! Subhuman! Someone lands a punch on Senator &#8216;Jumping&#8217; Jim Schpultz and suddenly the entire hall is a froth of human bodies pressing and tearing at each other. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is buried under a frenzied, amorous mob of her own staffers. Shreds of red cloth spurt upwards into the air. Meanwhile some members of the public have cornered Senator John Fetterman (D-PA). We found one, they bellow, he&#8217;s here, they brought one here. They advance with makeshift spears made from tripods and table legs and bits of doorframe, jabbing Senator Fetterman in the gut as he moans in inarticulate rage. The Capitol Police arrive, but after their orders to stop are ignored they start firing at random into the churning crowd. Finally, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), presiding, briefly achieves consciousness long enough to call the committee to order. Calm returns. Ananya Rao and Senator Schpultz return to their positions.</em></p><p>ANANYA RAO: Senator, you seem very concerned by what the ancestors of the nujaqaqtut did in the Pleistocene. I&#8217;d remind you that back then, <em>our</em> ancestors hunted them to the point of extinction. You say that they haven&#8217;t changed. Have we?</p><p>SEN. SCHPULTZ: No. I yield the floor. </p><div><hr></div><p>The day the Supreme Court announced its verdict in Telperion v. California, the stock market soared. Nujaqaq Intelligence was about to remake the world. A solution for climate change. A solution for disease. A solution for death. Telperion nearly doubled in value. It was also a very good day for Steyr, Beretta, and Bushmaster. Millions of civilian customers, all suddenly very interested in buying a .50 calibre anti-materiel rifle. </p><p>In the end, Telperion hadn&#8217;t made the compassionate case for nujaqaq humanity. No one was interested in that sort of thing any more; the world had moved on. They&#8217;d just pointed out that the United States had long set a precedent in which the best and brightest individuals from across the world had a right to settle in the country, and even during the age of racial restrictions on immigration, the fundamental criterion had always been intelligence. The Court&#8217;s function was to safeguard the interests of the United States, and it was obviously in the national interest to possess the nujaqaqtut. If America didn&#8217;t, China would. Delivering the majority verdict, Justice Sailer estimated that recognising as few as one hundred nujaqaqtut as American citizens would shift the national IQ past Germany; two hundred and the average American would be just a hair smarter than the average Chinese. With three hundred nujaqaqtut, every American, whatever their background, could say with pride that they belonged to the smartest country in the world.</p><p>The same day saw a large earthquake near Volgograd in Russia. Half the city flattened; dust-caked children crawling out the ruins of their homes. Volgograd is not a seismically active region. The Russian government announced that it believed the earthquake was caused by the United States, using some new weapon provided by its army of inhuman morozniks. Any further disasters on Russian soil would be considered an act of war by the United States, and met with an appropriate response. But what counts as a disaster? A snowstorm? A car accident? Anything; the enemy can do anything. What about the ordinary miseries of life? Later, a meeting of the Bishops&#8217; Council of the Russian Orthodox Church affirmed that the morozniks are demons.</p><p>In Copenhagen, the Danish government was in frantic conversation with its lawyers. The country was not doing well; half its economy had spontaneously evaporated when Ozempic users started ascending to Buddhahood and shedding the brute carapace of the physical body. That was why the Frederiksen government had agreed to start talking with Donald Trump about Greenland, and in the end they got nothing. They couldn&#8217;t sign over the island without a referendum, but then, once the Greenlanders had made it clear that they&#8217;d rather be Americans, how could Denmark take any money? The artist of the deal had won again, the government had collapsed, there were riots on the streets&#8212;and that was <em>before</em> a the world&#8217;s most valuable natural resource had been found in the land they&#8217;d just given away. Now Prime Minister Paludan and his Stram Kurs Party were leading a country on the point of collapse. If Denmark didn&#8217;t get <em>something</em> out of these nujaqaqtut, it might be civil war&#8230;</p><p>In London, the widely despised essayist Sam Kriss&#8212;now hunchbacked, jowly, and bald as the Moon&#8212;wrote what was generally considered to be the single worst take published on the issue. Kriss begins by limply hailing the result in Telperion v. California as an important blow against the forces of nativism and bigotry, obviously, obviously, we all agree. The nujaqaqtut will, he concedes, be able to integrate seamlessly into modern Western society. But what does it <em>say</em> about our society, he asks, that this is possible? &#8216;Everything that&#8217;s supposed to be strange and foreign about the nujaqaqtut is actually strangely <em>familiar</em>. The only human society with no creation myth, no culture-heroes, no metaphysical beliefs about the world&#8212;except, of course, from our own. We can understand metaphor, figurative language, murky forms of signification that doesn&#8217;t operate on the same na&#239;ve principle as number, and they can&#8217;t&#8212;but haven&#8217;t you people looked at this year&#8217;s Booker shortlist? Our literary culture is a shrinking circle of screeching literalists; everyone else has reverted to a preliterate, almost prehominid state, lapping up the natural signs that trickle out their phones. The biggest difference, though, is that nujaqaqtut society isn&#8217;t really a society at all, just a sprawling mass of isolated individuals who can only relate to each other through sporadic acts of violence. You see where I&#8217;m going here. When the nativists say that nujaqaqtut can never be real Americans, they&#8217;re not just bigoted; they&#8217;re <em>factually incorrect</em>. America is a society founded not on human social relations, but the principle of utility and selection, paring off population sectors from Europe and Africa, rearranging them in an inhuman hierarchy of phenotypes. Once this radical disarticulation was called <em>Liberty</em>. No one uses that word any more, but they&#8217;re still at it. The very notion of skilled immigration, attracting the best and brightest, most of all of <em>intelligence</em> as an abstract quantity: it&#8217;s a Neanderthal notion, a notion for lonely savages that howl wordless in the night. We are not for solving puzzles. I truly believe we are, in some sense, for loving each other. Thirty thousand years ago, this difference between ourselves and the Neanderthals was so profound that it could only be resolved through a war of extermination. We won that war, despite having far less computational power in our brains, because we could give names to the stars and build a commons out of the sky, and they could not. But in the end, it was all for nothing. We took the long way round, but we and the Neanderthals have converged on the same autistic point.&#8217;</p><p>The essay continues in this vein for another twenty-three thousand words, helpfully split into four paragraphs. Afterwards, the few remaining editors who still put up with Kriss all independently decided to stop replying to his emails. And he deserved it, because the essay was wrong on every point. Maybe if he&#8217;d bothered to ask the nujaqaqtut if <em>they</em> thought they were exactly the same as their hosts, he might have understood. </p><p>In Greenland, the great hunt was finally winding down. In fact, the whole island was winding down. Most of the half a million American settlers had already returned to the mainland: Greenland is over, it&#8217;s washed, the money&#8217;s dried up; the only way to be a big deal in Greenland is to get mauled to death by a nujaqaq. A lot of Inuit were leaving too. You can live in a dark, narrow apartment built by the Danes in 1967, or you can move to Houston, get a job on an offshore oil rig, and put your family in a brand-new house with a three-car garage. Obvious choice. The ice can creak to itself. Pointless to stay, now the nujaqaqut were gone. Operation Guardian Watch had been a success, but it came at a heavy price: some two hundred US servicemen killed or woundedin various engagements while trying to safely subdue a shrieking foaming nujaqaq. There was some unfortunate but unavoidable loss of life on the other side too, but of a total population above eight thousand, less than one thousand nujaqaqtut died in the relocation process. Now, after months of waiting, the next stage could begin. Telperion sent a fleet of especially modified jets to Nuuk. On each flight, a hundred nujaqaqtut sat in rows, heavily sedated, chained to their seats, transported to America.</p><p>They lived in underground cells on the Telperion campus in Mountain View. They liked the dark. They liked the sense of being enclosed. They liked going online too, although there was something about the way they typed that always seemed to make other users upset with them. Sometimes they were asked to solve small, self-evident mathematical problems, so they solved them. Is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra? Is the Mandelbrot set locally connected? The nujaqaqtut didn&#8217;t wonder why their hosts kept bothering them with this piddling stuff; that&#8217;s not the kind of question they think about. But they tried to fit in. They had learned about names; they had picked out new names for themselves from a list. They didn&#8217;t mingle outside their cells but they liked to chat on Discord. Some of them, like Cody and Dana and Ellen, had shaved their hair, the glorious thick white hair that protected them on the ice, to reveal the raw pink skin underneath. A smooth, pink face. Cody claimed to have listened to music. The company had told him he might enjoy something called Bach, which was made of numbers, but the chaos of reverberating strings and air moving through pipes had been so horrible he&#8217;d had to turn it off after only a few seconds. Ellen had started wearing clothes. It was uncomfortable; the sensation of clothes against her naked skin; the first time she shrieked uncontrollably and tore them to pieces. After a few weeks she was wearing them all the time. She didn&#8217;t go up any more, though. The one time she did go outside she had liked walking around on the grass and touching the trees, observing the little birds that made noises like moving ice, but then she came to the edge of the campus and on the other side of the fence there was a huge group of them, all shouting and yelling and they threw rocks over the fence to hit her. These were the creatures that had stormed out of nowhere fifty thousand years ago to destroy the world, and now it had happened again. They looked like smaller, weaker, hairless humans, but they weren&#8217;t human at all; they were something else. An insect, a type of ant or bee, a hive-kind, almost mindless but swarming. Ellen knew what it meant to be happy or sad or angry but it made no sense that these things could be happy or sad or angry <em>in a group</em>. Their angry swarm had swallowed everything until Ellen was reduced to the furthest patch of ice on the edge of the world, but it wasn&#8217;t enough. Eventually there had been someone on the ice. Ellen stood and stared at the swarm as it shrieked and wailed its strange collective fury. Rocks bounced harmlessly off her head.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\"><em>EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH!</em></p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email&#8230;\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

There’s diamonds in there, huge seams of copper and zinc, rare earth metals, the wealth of a small continent, and all of it is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick. You can’t build on the ice and you can’t dig through it either, because the ice is not static. Not glassy and smooth but jagged, rucked up everywhere with jostling peaks, and it flows: every part of the ice sheet is slowly spreading out of the centre of the island and into the sea. Any permanent structure you try to build there will end up on an iceberg, dissolving in the Atlantic. If you try to dig through the ice and into the mineral-rich rock beneath, three trillion tons of creaking, patient ice will crush your borehole and snap your drills like matchsticks. The ice is empty. Animals don’t go there. There’s nothing to eat, this far from the sea, where the ground never thaws. Not even rocks to nuzzle for lichen. Some ice worms that scrub the red algae off the glaciers, but nothing desperate enough to feed on them. Humans don’t go there either. A few scientific research stations that sprout up for three months before being dismantled again. The US military built a base on the ice once to store their missiles, but they felt the ground moving, closing around their silos, ready to pop the nuclear warheads like bubble wrap, and the base was abandoned. A few explorers and adventurers are buried in there, slowly crushed between groaning walls of ice. All of Greenland’s original settlements are on the thin rind of exposed rock around the edge. You can fish there. For a few months in the summer you can grow potatoes in the thin acidic soil. No one lives on the ice. But there’s someone on the ice.\nThe first documented encounter with the icedwellers was filmed by Jaxon Flores, an American settler, just outside his homestead above Qikangittuqaqquti on the edge of the ice. Flores had, like half a million Americans, moved to the new unincorporated federal territory of Greenland under the Second Frontier programme. Footage captured from his livestream shows Flores on the ice. It’s night; it’s been night for weeks. He’s standing in front of a ring light, and the crags and spears of ice behind him glow semitransparent, like a world of jagged glass. Flores wears a black parka and repeatedly hits a vape pen as he talks to his phone. STOP BEING GAY, he says. Literally bro just stop being gay, he says, I literally don’t know how else to put it, you are gay. Your ancestors, your ancestors—he sucks on the vape—your ancestors carved a society out of the wilderness. Your ancestors were men. They went to the desert and tamed it, they fought savage tribes, they fought literal fuckin demons to build the modern world. They reaped the fruits of civilisation because they’d earned it. How do you think your ancestors would feel to see you eating processed slop and fapping to pornography? If you’re not already in Greenland, if you’re still in Fake America—a huge cloud of vapour freezing to tiny crystals as he exhales—you’re not gonna make it bro. Here he spreads his arms wide at the black desert around him. There’s no laws! he shouts. No laws here, no taxes, it’s just men, real men, building a new society in Hyperborea. You could be minting crypto here bro, you could be running cams, you could be doing shit that would get you a fucking jail sentence in Fake America. Right now I’m building generational wealth. In like sixty years when the ice melts and they find gold my great grandkids will be trillionaires. I did that. And instead you’re saving for a down payment for a studio in Miami to party with females, because you—and here Flores leans in close to the camera until you can see the ice glittering in his eyelashes—are gay.\nIn addition to his mandatory homestead, Flores had bought twenty plots of Greenland ice shelf during the initial government auction. Hundreds of thousands of people watched his daily streams from the middle of the wilderness. He had failed to sell a single plot. In the darkness behind him the ice gurgled and whined. Sounds like rubber stretching, like steel twisting, like a gasp from the bottom of the world.\nThe footage shows Flores continuing to speak for another hour. He answers questions from his chat. He talks about how much money he’s making. At 1:13:22, the lighting behind him changes; some of the shards of ice appear to be lit by a faint, local orange glow. At 1:15:09, Flores stops talking and stares at the camera. Yeah yeah, he says, nice try. He stares silently at a point directly below the camera for twelve more seconds. Fuck you, he says, there’s no one behind me. But he turns around and looks anyway, and then suddenly ducks down. For just under two seconds the footage captures what looks like a human shape on a ridge of ice, but taller and more massive than any man, holding a smouldering clump of dried heather in one enormous hand. Then the light vanishes and we are very close to Flores’ face, lit only by the glow from his screen. Yo, he hoots, yoooo. From its peaks of ice the visitor responds. Its voice is high and loud, strained, nasal, more like the scream of a bird of prey than anything human. EEOOOOOOOOOOOGH, it says. The footage ends.\n\nIn 1722, the Twin Realms of Denmark-Norway established the first modern European colony on the island of Greenland, with a mission to secure its waters for Danish-Norwegian whalers, and to establish contact with the survivors from the old Norse settlement, first established seven hundred years previously. There was a lot of speculation about those settlers, who would have spent generations completely isolated from their cousins in Europe. They wouldn’t know about the Protestant reformation or the rediscovery of America or that the Earth revolved around the Sun. They would still be stuck in Catholicism, or maybe they’d reverted back to the worship of the pagan gods, Thor and Odin, or whatever new deities bubbled out the swamps of this heathen land on the edge of the world. The colonists arrived to find that no one was there. They landed at the Eystribygð, where there should have been farms of fat sheep and monasteries and Brattahlíð, the grand estate of Erik the Red, and all that remained was a pile of stones that had once been a church. In the hills around the ruin skulked the Skrælingar, the people of dried pelts and bone-tipped spears.\nEventually the colony’s pastor, an excitable young man called Jens Måskesen, managed to learn enough Inuit to speak to them. They told him that they were not the first people to come to Greenland, but when they arrived the place was already populated by the nujaqaqut, or the hairy ones. The nujaqaqut were described as tall, broad men with light-coloured hair. When the Inuit arrived the nujaqaqut were living on the coast, but they had fought and now they lived in the interior, on the ice. Måskesen concluded that these must be the Vikings he was looking for, mounted an expedition into the icy interior of Greenland, and was never seen again.\nHe’d learned some of his hosts’ vocabulary, but not the grammar. Inuit languages distinguish between animate and inanimate nouns; the animate form would be nujaqaqtut. These were not men.\nSix months later, a ship from Denmark stopped at the colony with a replacement pastor. August Risle was a man of the Enlightenment: a philologist, a vermeologist, a proto-anthropologist, and an inventor of small but vicious devices. He had spent two years in Lapland learning about the lives of the Lapps, two years in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals learning about the lives of the Kaluks, and one year in the forests of Kalukiya beyond the Urals desperately trying to get back over the Urals and go home. In Greenland, Risle took a far more systematic approach than his predecessor. He didn’t just learn passable Inuit; he learned to canoe, he accompanied his Inuit hosts on seal-hunting trips, he learned about their religion, in which everything that breathes is a part of the sky, and he witnessed their funerals, in which the dead are wrapped in a sealskin shroud and buried under the sea ice.\nThere were a lot of funerals; one by one his hosts were dying of smallpox. Despite this, Risle never gave his hosts the other thing that Europeans were busy spreading to every new population they encountered, which was Christianity. He let them keep their sky thick with souls. He let them believe the winds were made of the dead and the unborn, and the stronger bodiless spirits out there, like Saampu who comes in nightmares to chase you with his black teeth. He let them die unsaved. But before the surviving Inuit fled the new Danish settlement, he found out about the nujaqaqut, the hairy ones. The Inuit told him that just like there could be breath without body, sometimes there were bodies without breath. Every person breathes a part of the wind, and all the animals they have to hunt, and even rocks and plants, but not the nujaqaqut, who are shaped like men but have no souls. Because they’re made of leftover body, they can wear the signs of any animal. All of them are covered from head to foot in white hair like a bear, but some of them have antlers too, or a pair of walrus tusks. They have terrible fangs. They live on the ice but come near human settlements at night, to steal Inuit men and women and feast on their flesh. The nujaqaqut are not the old Viking settlers. The nujaqaqut are what ate them.\nRisle concluded that the Norse settlement had probably collapsed due to changes in the climate and struggles with the Inuit. The nujaqaqut, he wrote, were how the Inuit, who had some intelligence, expressed their own condition. They could feel that their souls belonged to the infinite sky, but their material lives were miserable, cold, savage, and impoverished, and this fundamental fact of life on the pole was given form as the man-eating nujaqaqut. In such a desolate place, cannibalism was probably not unknown. Risle never thought about the monsters again. The rest of his time in Greenland was devoted to his real passion, the study of worms. Feeding the local earthworms into one of his own little rotating contraptions, which slowly peeled an earthworm until it was a large square sheet of weeping, semitransparent slime.\nMaybe he should have looked a little harder. According to the Saga of the Greenlanders, ‘learned men say that in the summer in which Erik set out to settle Greenland, thirty-five ships sailed out of Breiðafjörður and Borgarfjörður; fourteen of these arrived there safely, some were driven back and some were lost, and one arrived but the crew were lost to the náttskrækja.’ Náttskrækja means night-screecher. It’s not clear what this refers to, but presumably the saga’s audience would have known. What it ultimately means is that when Erik first came to Greenland, there was already someone on the ice.\nAcross the two hundred-odd years of Danish sovereignty in Greenland, settlers had a habit of disappearing, like Jens Måskesen, off the edge of the ice sheet. There are empty graves up and down the coast. But Greenland is a dangerous country, and the numbers were too small to notice. Strange things kept happening after 1940, when the United States took over effective governorship of the island. The Americans built military bases, airstrips, radar stations, listening posts, missile silos. For a while, one of the tallest manmade structures on the planet was an American military radio tower in Greenland. All of this was secret; the Greenlanders had no idea what was happening in their country. The Danes still paid for fishing ports and housing projects and pretended the place was theirs, but America had the crown of the world, peering over the pole and into Russia: this unearthly island, halfway into outer space. The soldiers were uneasy there. Every few years, when the nights dragged on for weeks, someone disappeared. In 1971, the guns at Thule Air Base fired continuously into the ice for three hours. Helicopters were sent up to strafe the surrounding fjords. Artillery shells burst into the glaciers. Afterwards, the Air Force was unable to explain exactly what had happened. All they knew was that they’d come under attack. Not the Soviets. Something in the night.\nIf the military knew what it was that attacked them, they didn’t say. It was easy to keep secrets in the north. Or it was until 2025, when President Trump, who never had any patience for subtext, decided to get rid of the useful fiction in which Greenland was still an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, and half a million American settlers spread out over the ice.\n\nThe Greenland PD found Jaxon Flores smeared across the surface of the glacier like a burst fly. A month later something attacked a homestead near Quviananngit. Gnaw marks on the bones. In the northeast corner of the island a shell corporation was operating a gladiatorial arena, fights to the death livestreamed back to the mainland. The last few frames before the feed cut out showed an enormous nude figure as it burst screeching through the wall, seized one of the combatants by his head, and bounced him against the floor like a basketball. In the first two years of mass American settlement in Greenland, at least eighteen Second Frontierspeople were killed in similar attacks. Two and a half years after the death of Jaxon Flores, someone finally managed to take down a nujaqaq.\nThe attack took place at Hyperborea Two, a neo-Nazi compound in the south of the island. Hyperborea Two was the home of the Origins Movement, led by Fred McIntosh, who had been a promising research chemist until 1986, when he decided to devote himself entirely to the idea that the ancestors of the white race had come to Earth from the star Alpha Tauri, and their original home on this planet had been a now-vanished temperate continent covering the North Pole. McIntosh taught that the Neanderthals were a race of extraterrestrial Aryan supermen, and their diminished descendants could reactivate their Neanderthal genes through exposure to the Northern Lights. Like most American settlements, Hyperborea Two sustained itself by taking advantage of Greenland’s lax legal regime; they’d built a lab out on the ice, which they were using to produce generic versions of prescription drugs, which they then sold online. Originally the lab was set up to manufacture opiates, benzos, and amphetamines; their bestselling product ended up being aripiprazole, an antipsychotic. In the middle of the night—it’s always night—a figure leaped out of the ice with an unearthly high-pitched scream and tore two armed guards gorily in two. Inside the compound, it ripped through two more Nazis in short order. It was shot in the leg, the shoulder, and the hip without slowing down. A gunshot directly to the head failed to kill it. Finally, one of the Nazis put a round directly through the intruder’s eye, and it collapsed. They posted a photo online, the surviving cultists posing behind the corpse like they’d brought down a buck. Two of them holding up Black Sun flags. McIntosh himself in the middle, gripping an AR-15 tight with his leathery, palsied hands. The nujaqaq lay on its side, all eight feet of it, naked, head lolling, one sightless eye pointed at nothing, one a dried-up wound, with black trails of blood matting the thick white hair that covered every inch of its body.\nThe body was seized by the GPD and handed over to federal authorities. Genomic analysis revealed that what the Origins Movement had killed was, in fact, an Aryan superman. Mitochondrial DNA revealed that around 1% of the ice monster’s ancestry was shared by populations in Iceland and Denmark. The most genetically similar sample overall, though, came from a 38,000-year-old bone found in the Vindija Cave in Croatia. It had belonged to a Neanderthal.\nIt took a long time to find one alive on the ice. Drones with thermal cameras fanned out over Greenland, searching for wandering bands of nujaqaqut, and found nothing. The nujaqaqut don’t travel in bands. Their thick fur means their bodies barely lose any heat. They looked for signs of habitation, but the nujaqaqut don’t build shelters. What they did find was shit, the huge warm logs the nujaqaqut left in crevasses of the ice. Follow the shit, and eventually you’ll find the shitter. The US military tracked a juvenile male as he plodded south across the wilderness, heading towards the homestead of a sports betting website. Before the creature could start mauling the bookies, a strike team helidropped onto the ice to detain it. Getting the nujaqaq into captivity was a brutal, screeching struggle; once locked up at an Air Force facility in Nuuk, though, it was almost embarrassingly docile. It didn’t froth or try to break out of its cell; its calm, quiet gaze was mostly drawn to electric lights. Like a newborn baby. It shrieked and howled when it saw its captors, but without aggression. MRI scans showed that whatever was happening in its head, the nujaqaq vocal tract only allowed a very limited level of voice modulation; these nasal screams were the closest it could get to language. But there didn’t seem to be much happening in its head either. The nujaqaq passed the mirror test, but it wouldn’t look its captors in the face. Attempts to teach it sign language were a dismal failure. The creature just sat calmly and quietly, and its cold blue eyes watched the moving fingers as if they were eddies of ice twisting in the wind. It inhabited a world without meaning.\nBut it was very good at puzzles. The researchers tried a game that offered the nujaqaq a small morsel of food if it could press four coloured buttons in a particular sequence. It could remember a sequence of four. It could remember a series of forty. It could remember a sequence of four hundred. They tried presenting it with increasingly complicated mazes, but it always went for the optimal route without any apparent effort. They gave it a Rubik’s cube, which it solved instantly, but once it became clear that there wasn’t any food inside it showed no interest in solving any of the other, larger cubes it was offered. They tried the memory game again, but this time with numbers instead of colours. Then they tried teaching it basic addition and subtraction, which it took to almost immediately. When a piece of hamburger was on offer, the nujaqaq could multiply twelve-digit integers in its head. A few days later, having burned through everything in their library, the researchers tried giving it the P versus NP problem. The next morning, the nujaqaq had produced eight dense pages demonstrating that P did, in fact, equal NP. Any problem that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial time. Just not by you.\n\nFrom a special hearing on the nujaqaqtut by the Joint Congressional Committee on Greenland.\nSENATOR ‘JUMPING’ JIM SCHPULTZ (R-WY): Ms Rao, just to make sure i’ve got this right—when you introduced yourself earlier, you said you were the CTO of Telperion, Inc., which is a technology services firm based out of Mountain View, California?\nANANYA RAO: That’s correct.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: And you sell—\nANANYA RAO: We partner with clients including the federal government to deliver bespoke solutions for the data problems of tomorrow.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you are not a biologist.\nANANYA RAO: I am not.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Did you minor in biology? AP biology, perhaps?\nANANYA RAO: My background is in computer science, Senator. I don’t see—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Forgive me. I just find it strange, Ms Rao, that you say you’re not a biologist, but at the same time you’ve here to tell us that these, uh, nujaqaqs are human beings.\nANANYA RAO: I’m sorry, but I find your insinuation here incredibly offensive.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: I’m not insinuating anything, I’m only trying to see—\nANANYA RAO: Not so long ago, Senator, this very body held that some people were only three-fifths of a human being. Because of the way they looked and the way they spoke, because they looked different—respectfully, Senator, because they looked different to white men like yourself. There is a shameful history in this country of dehumanisation and violence, and it’s especially shocking, Senator Schpultz, to hear someone revive that hateful language, here, in the twenty-first century. The genus and species of the nujaqaqtut are Homo and sapiens. That’s what the science says.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Ms Rao, this thing is eight feet tall and it eats raw meat. You’re telling me a Neanderthal is Homo sapiens?\nANANYA RAO: That’s what the science says. As far as I know, the law makes no distinction. Title 1 of the US Code says a human being is any member of the species Homo sapiens who is born alive. There’s no exception for Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. Senator, I’m not going to debate their humanity with you. They are as human as you or me, and according to the Greenland Annexation Act—which I remember you promoting as one of your proudest achievements—that means they’re fully entitled to live and work here, and to claim American citizenship if they want.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you’re not saying they’re human like you or me. You’re saying they’re some kind of super human.\nANANYA RAO: I wouldn’t say that at all, no. We believe that all humans have an equal—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Your company says they’re smarter than us. Is that true?\nANANYA RAO: There’s no one measure of intelligence.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: It’s a yes or no answer.\nANANYA RAO: There’s a holistic, multidimensional—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: You’ve been testing them for something. Yes or no.\nANANYA RAO: Yes. They’re smarter than us.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Care to put a number on it? Are we talking about an IQ of 200 here? 300?\nANANYA RAO: Honestly, I can’t say. None of us are smart enough to come up with a test capable of measuring nujaqaq intelligence. Everything we make, they ace.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But you’re talking about a group that never invented writing, never invented the wheel…\nANANYA RAO: They need to be in the right environment. The nujaqaqtut find certain things harder than we do. They’re less social, they don’t work so collaboratively. All those brilliant minds were stuck in the Stone Age for two hundred thousand years. But we have the tools to help them realise their potential. There’s now a small colony of nujaqaqtut at the Air Force base in Nuuk that Telperion’s been working with. They can’t speak, but we’ve been teaching them to type. In fact, there’s a little girl there called Ada who wrote you a letter. I have it here.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Go ahead.\nANANYA RAO: She writes: Dear Senator ‘Jumping’ Jim Schpultz, my name is Ada and I am four years old and I love you because you are a US Senator for the state of Wyoming and Wyoming is my favourite state because of all the states it’s the closest to being a perfect square which is my favourite shape. Colorado is also close to being a perfect square but Wyoming is closer than Colorado. Wyoming is defined by geodesics along 41°N to 45°N latitude and 104°W to 111°W longitude so its borders form a near-spherical quadrilateral however the Earth is not a perfect sphere so using the Vincenty formula on the WGS84 reference ellipsoid its north-south and east-west geodesic lengths are approximately 570.3 km and 444.4 km which means an aspect ratio of 1.28. Colorado’s aspect ratio is 1.36 which makes it less like a perfect square. However even though the meridional convergence at higher latitudes contributes to Wyoming’s lower aspect ratio Colorado’s angular excess on the WGS84 ellipsoid calculated with L’Huillier’s theorem is 0.38 while Wyoming’s angular excess is 2.35° which means Wyoming has greater distortion on an ellipsoidal manifold and therefore Colorado is actually more like a square as plotted in Euclidean space. One day I want to visit Wyoming and see its famous sights which include Devil’s Tower National Monument, Yellowstone National Park, and Buffalo Bill Center of the West. Yours sincerely, Ada.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: That’s very sweet.\nANANYA RAO: Thank you.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: She sure sounds like a smart kid.\nANANYA RAO: She is.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: But as sweet as your letter is, it’s not the only letter I’ve been receiving. See, I also got a letter from Dr Sarah Fang. Dr Fang is an anthropologist attached to the Air Force Culture and Language Center out of Maxwell AFB in Alabama, and the whole time you’ve been studying these nujaqaqs, she’s been studying them too. Unlike yourself, she can’t appear before this hearing, but she tells me that the, uh, cries and wails of these—let’s call them these folks you have there in Greenland—to the extent that they’re a language, it’s now been pretty well deciphered. Now you can call that little, that little pup you have—you can call her Ada if you want, but her mother never called her that. Dr Fang tells me that in the language she actually speaks, there’s no such thing as a name. They don’t have them. There’s also no words, she says, for ‘me’ or ‘you.’ Are you aware, Ms Rao, of any human languages that don’t have a word for ‘me’ or ‘you’?\nANANYA RAO: I’m not a linguist.\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: You’re not a linguist. Now, earlier, you said that the nujaqaqs don’t work as collaboratively as we do. Well, that’s one way of putting it. Dr Fang tells me the same thing. She says they have no form of social organisation whatsoever. They don’t have chiefs or leaders, they don’t have collective myths or narratives, they don’t build any kind of individual or collective dwellings, and they don’t have any concept at all of God. Even monkeys touch and groom each other, but not these fellas. They do not have such a thing as family. Once a child is weaned, the mother just abandons it on the ice. I reckon my dog is a better mother than that. Now, ladies and gentlemen, you might wonder how a species that hates its own kind so badly would even manage to survive so long. Well, in her report, Dr Fang explains it. Let me read here. In the absence of any stable mating or kinship structures, she writes, Nunjaqaq reproduction is achieved sporadically and opportunistically, almost exclusively through what our society would consider rape.\nA murmur in the room. Whispers fluttering. The creak of seats.\nANANYA RAO: Senator, this is naked fearmongering. We’re talking about a situation—\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: Now, I understand that Telperion stands to make a lot of money from these nujaqaqs. You have your Big Tech shareholders to answer to, and that’s our American system. But I have my constituents. What am I supposed to say to the parents of a little girl who’s been raped by one of your pet geniuses? How am I supposed to comfort them when their little angel has been raped, savagely raped, and then not just killed, but killed and eaten? You are talking about introducing a population of prehistoric predators into our country. You want to bring these man-eating carnivores into our towns and cities, into our workplaces, into our schools. You say they’re entitled to be part of our American society. You say you’re not going to debate their humanity, but that’s exactly the debate we need to have. Now I reckon that if you don’t have any notion of a family, any notion of home, or any notion of God, that disqualifies you right there from being an American. And to be frank, if you go about buck naked and you live off human flesh, whatever you may be, it isn’t human. These are wild animals, and if you let them in here, they will do exactly what they did in the Pleistocene. They will rape, and they will kill, and they will eat. And I tell you now, Ms Rao, as God is my witness I am not going to let you or your monsters do that to any of my little girls.\nUproar. Four members of the Joint Committee start shouting at once. Members of the press rush towards the podium. A clamour from two of the other expert witnesses, objecting in the most strenuous possible terms. The Ambassador from Denmark is trying to bellow over everyone, mottled red and white and clammy like a slice of bacon. Another expert witness is rocking back and forth and giggling to himself. Beasts! he giggles. Beasts! Monsters! Subhuman! Someone lands a punch on Senator ‘Jumping’ Jim Schpultz and suddenly the entire hall is a froth of human bodies pressing and tearing at each other. Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is buried under a frenzied, amorous mob of her own staffers. Shreds of red cloth spurt upwards into the air. Meanwhile some members of the public have cornered Senator John Fetterman (D-PA). We found one, they bellow, he’s here, they brought one here. They advance with makeshift spears made from tripods and table legs and bits of doorframe, jabbing Senator Fetterman in the gut as he moans in inarticulate rage. The Capitol Police arrive, but after their orders to stop are ignored they start firing at random into the churning crowd. Finally, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), presiding, briefly achieves consciousness long enough to call the committee to order. Calm returns. Ananya Rao and Senator Schpultz return to their positions.\nANANYA RAO: Senator, you seem very concerned by what the ancestors of the nujaqaqtut did in the Pleistocene. I’d remind you that back then, our ancestors hunted them to the point of extinction. You say that they haven’t changed. Have we?\nSEN. SCHPULTZ: No. I yield the floor.\n\nThe day the Supreme Court announced its verdict in Telperion v. California, the stock market soared. Nujaqaq Intelligence was about to remake the world. A solution for climate change. A solution for disease. A solution for death. Telperion nearly doubled in value. It was also a very good day for Steyr, Beretta, and Bushmaster. Millions of civilian customers, all suddenly very interested in buying a .50 calibre anti-materiel rifle.\nIn the end, Telperion hadn’t made the compassionate case for nujaqaq humanity. No one was interested in that sort of thing any more; the world had moved on. They’d just pointed out that the United States had long set a precedent in which the best and brightest individuals from across the world had a right to settle in the country, and even during the age of racial restrictions on immigration, the fundamental criterion had always been intelligence. The Court’s function was to safeguard the interests of the United States, and it was obviously in the national interest to possess the nujaqaqtut. If America didn’t, China would. Delivering the majority verdict, Justice Sailer estimated that recognising as few as one hundred nujaqaqtut as American citizens would shift the national IQ past Germany; two hundred and the average American would be just a hair smarter than the average Chinese. With three hundred nujaqaqtut, every American, whatever their background, could say with pride that they belonged to the smartest country in the world.\nThe same day saw a large earthquake near Volgograd in Russia. Half the city flattened; dust-caked children crawling out the ruins of their homes. Volgograd is not a seismically active region. The Russian government announced that it believed the earthquake was caused by the United States, using some new weapon provided by its army of inhuman morozniks. Any further disasters on Russian soil would be considered an act of war by the United States, and met with an appropriate response. But what counts as a disaster? A snowstorm? A car accident? Anything; the enemy can do anything. What about the ordinary miseries of life? Later, a meeting of the Bishops’ Council of the Russian Orthodox Church affirmed that the morozniks are demons.\nIn Copenhagen, the Danish government was in frantic conversation with its lawyers. The country was not doing well; half its economy had spontaneously evaporated when Ozempic users started ascending to Buddhahood and shedding the brute carapace of the physical body. That was why the Frederiksen government had agreed to start talking with Donald Trump about Greenland, and in the end they got nothing. They couldn’t sign over the island without a referendum, but then, once the Greenlanders had made it clear that they’d rather be Americans, how could Denmark take any money? The artist of the deal had won again, the government had collapsed, there were riots on the streets—and that was before a the world’s most valuable natural resource had been found in the land they’d just given away. Now Prime Minister Paludan and his Stram Kurs Party were leading a country on the point of collapse. If Denmark didn’t get something out of these nujaqaqtut, it might be civil war…\nIn London, the widely despised essayist Sam Kriss—now hunchbacked, jowly, and bald as the Moon—wrote what was generally considered to be the single worst take published on the issue. Kriss begins by limply hailing the result in Telperion v. California as an important blow against the forces of nativism and bigotry, obviously, obviously, we all agree. The nujaqaqtut will, he concedes, be able to integrate seamlessly into modern Western society. But what does it say about our society, he asks, that this is possible? ‘Everything that’s supposed to be strange and foreign about the nujaqaqtut is actually strangely familiar. The only human society with no creation myth, no culture-heroes, no metaphysical beliefs about the world—except, of course, from our own. We can understand metaphor, figurative language, murky forms of signification that doesn’t operate on the same naïve principle as number, and they can’t—but haven’t you people looked at this year’s Booker shortlist? Our literary culture is a shrinking circle of screeching literalists; everyone else has reverted to a preliterate, almost prehominid state, lapping up the natural signs that trickle out their phones. The biggest difference, though, is that nujaqaqtut society isn’t really a society at all, just a sprawling mass of isolated individuals who can only relate to each other through sporadic acts of violence. You see where I’m going here. When the nativists say that nujaqaqtut can never be real Americans, they’re not just bigoted; they’re factually incorrect. America is a society founded not on human social relations, but the principle of utility and selection, paring off population sectors from Europe and Africa, rearranging them in an inhuman hierarchy of phenotypes. Once this radical disarticulation was called Liberty. No one uses that word any more, but they’re still at it. The very notion of skilled immigration, attracting the best and brightest, most of all of intelligence as an abstract quantity: it’s a Neanderthal notion, a notion for lonely savages that howl wordless in the night. We are not for solving puzzles. I truly believe we are, in some sense, for loving each other. Thirty thousand years ago, this difference between ourselves and the Neanderthals was so profound that it could only be resolved through a war of extermination. We won that war, despite having far less computational power in our brains, because we could give names to the stars and build a commons out of the sky, and they could not. But in the end, it was all for nothing. We took the long way round, but we and the Neanderthals have converged on the same autistic point.’\nThe essay continues in this vein for another twenty-three thousand words, helpfully split into four paragraphs. Afterwards, the few remaining editors who still put up with Kriss all independently decided to stop replying to his emails. And he deserved it, because the essay was wrong on every point. Maybe if he’d bothered to ask the nujaqaqtut if they thought they were exactly the same as their hosts, he might have understood.\nIn Greenland, the great hunt was finally winding down. In fact, the whole island was winding down. Most of the half a million American settlers had already returned to the mainland: Greenland is over, it’s washed, the money’s dried up; the only way to be a big deal in Greenland is to get mauled to death by a nujaqaq. A lot of Inuit were leaving too. You can live in a dark, narrow apartment built by the Danes in 1967, or you can move to Houston, get a job on an offshore oil rig, and put your family in a brand-new house with a three-car garage. Obvious choice. The ice can creak to itself. Pointless to stay, now the nujaqaqut were gone. Operation Guardian Watch had been a success, but it came at a heavy price: some two hundred US servicemen killed or woundedin various engagements while trying to safely subdue a shrieking foaming nujaqaq. There was some unfortunate but unavoidable loss of life on the other side too, but of a total population above eight thousand, less than one thousand nujaqaqtut died in the relocation process. Now, after months of waiting, the next stage could begin. Telperion sent a fleet of especially modified jets to Nuuk. On each flight, a hundred nujaqaqtut sat in rows, heavily sedated, chained to their seats, transported to America.\nThey lived in underground cells on the Telperion campus in Mountain View. They liked the dark. They liked the sense of being enclosed. They liked going online too, although there was something about the way they typed that always seemed to make other users upset with them. Sometimes they were asked to solve small, self-evident mathematical problems, so they solved them. Is every finite lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite algebra? Is the Mandelbrot set locally connected? The nujaqaqtut didn’t wonder why their hosts kept bothering them with this piddling stuff; that’s not the kind of question they think about. But they tried to fit in. They had learned about names; they had picked out new names for themselves from a list. They didn’t mingle outside their cells but they liked to chat on Discord. Some of them, like Cody and Dana and Ellen, had shaved their hair, the glorious thick white hair that protected them on the ice, to reveal the raw pink skin underneath. A smooth, pink face. Cody claimed to have listened to music. The company had told him he might enjoy something called Bach, which was made of numbers, but the chaos of reverberating strings and air moving through pipes had been so horrible he’d had to turn it off after only a few seconds. Ellen had started wearing clothes. It was uncomfortable; the sensation of clothes against her naked skin; the first time she shrieked uncontrollably and tore them to pieces. After a few weeks she was wearing them all the time. She didn’t go up any more, though. The one time she did go outside she had liked walking around on the grass and touching the trees, observing the little birds that made noises like moving ice, but then she came to the edge of the campus and on the other side of the fence there was a huge group of them, all shouting and yelling and they threw rocks over the fence to hit her. These were the creatures that had stormed out of nowhere fifty thousand years ago to destroy the world, and now it had happened again. They looked like smaller, weaker, hairless humans, but they weren’t human at all; they were something else. An insect, a type of ant or bee, a hive-kind, almost mindless but swarming. Ellen knew what it meant to be happy or sad or angry but it made no sense that these things could be happy or sad or angry in a group. Their angry swarm had swallowed everything until Ellen was reduced to the furthest patch of ice on the edge of the world, but it wasn’t enough. Eventually there had been someone on the ice. Ellen stood and stared at the swarm as it shrieked and wailed its strange collective fury. Rocks bounced harmlessly off her head.\n\n\n\n\nEEOOOOOOOOOOOGH!",

I go up there for you, to hear the future on the wind. But whenever I descend from the mountain with new prophecies for the coming year, it&#8217;s to a bunch of miserable complaints from you lot. Apparently, my prophecies &#8216;aren&#8217;t accurate.&#8217; Apparently, I&#8217;m just &#8216;making up things that sound interesting with no actual vatic quality.&#8217; Apparently I&#8217;m &#8216;outperformed by every prediction market going plus a bunch of supposedly psychic aquarium creatures.&#8217; The evidence is that <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2023\">in 2023</a> I predicted that Donald Trump would die, and he didn&#8217;t, and then <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/prophecies-for-2024\">in 2024</a> I predicted that the US election would be won by <em>nobody</em>, and it wasn&#8217;t. &#8216;The 2024 election,&#8217; I wrote, &#8216;will simply <em>never end</em>. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end.&#8217; I&#8217;m told the Democrats are still fundraising as if there&#8217;s something at stake, but everyone else has agreed that there was in fact a winner, and it was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, I predicted that the Tories would somehow win the general election in the UK, which they didn&#8217;t, and that 2024 would feature some major act of fuckery by the Dutch, which they&#8217;ve managed to keep well hidden. It&#8217;s got to the point where I can&#8217;t so much as descend from my mountain without a mob of furious peasants braying unintelligibly at me while pointing at various misshapen vegetables whose advent I apparently failed to foresee. </p><p>I refuse to apologise. You haven&#8217;t been up on the mountain; I have. My prophecies are perfect. You live beneath the clouds, and you simply haven&#8217;t understood.</p><p>Take my election prophecy. Yes, I said that &#8216;Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they&#8217;ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died.&#8217; (I did correctly predict a Trump victory in September, but that doesn&#8217;t count.) Isn&#8217;t it weird, though, that the best part of a prophecy supposedly about how immovable Trump and Biden are was instead devoted to <em>Kamala Harris</em>? In the depths of last winter, I somehow had a vision of the Brat Summer that was coming. This is how prophecy works. There are wheels within wheels here; it takes a subtle reader to look past the overt content and see how I was actually completely right all along. Most readers are not subtle readers. But I think <em>you</em> might be. I don&#8217;t know how I can tell, but I have this strange sense that you&#8217;re better and smarter than the dumb pigs who read my prophecies. You see what&#8217;s really going on. You aren&#8217;t fooled by the surfaces of things&#8230;</p><p>If you need any more evidence, though, I&#8217;ll just point out that one year ago I wrote that while AI wouldn&#8217;t replace literary prose, it would start replacing ordinary conversation. &#8216;Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone&#8217;s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response.&#8217; Apple is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deNzYrTvqCs\">now advertising my nightmares as a nifty new feature</a>. I prophesied that all the Simone Weil-inflected flirtation with religious dogma had reached a cultural saturation point and we&#8217;d be heading back towards a kind of resurgent Even Newer Atheism, and last year the Grey Tribe scored its first act of spectacular public violence, which is basically a Bar Mitzvah for ideologies. (More on that later.) I prophesied that the new alternative media would start to recede, and everything would return to being consolidated around a few big mainstream outlets, and this has turned out truer than I ever imagined: in fact, this year&#8217;s most lively topic of debate on Substack, the home of lively debate, is <a href=\"https://thepointmag.substack.com/p/becca-rothfeld-and-sam-kahn-on-substack\">how much worse</a> Substack is than traditional magazine publishing. </p><p>If the overt meanings of last year&#8217;s prophecies were sometimes confusing, though, it can only be because I arrived at them in part through a three-card Tarot draw. I saw the year unfold in the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. But the Tarot is a subtle instrument, and reading it requires digging through many strata of meaning, all of them obscure. Maybe you need a clearer, more scientific approach. Luckily, we have one. </p><p>The year 2025 was born on January 1st, 2025, which makes it a Capricorn. Capricorn is an Earth sign, grounded, plodding, materialistic; one of the draught animals of the Zodiac. It&#8217;s under the rulership of Saturn: the melancholy king at the edge of space, who sets the limit and imposes the law, god of age and time. The obvious conclusion is that 2025 will not be a year of revolutions. We&#8217;ll see more reactionary retrenchment, more state crackdowns, more grey normality over the earth. The only problem is that <em>every</em> year is a Capricorn, since they all begin in early January. 1789 was a Capricorn; 1968 was a Capricorn. The numbered calendar year is always a Capricorn because the numbered calendar year is a bureaucratic imposition on the wild flows of time. Fortunately, we&#8217;re not limited to sun sign astrology, but the planets all seem to be telling the same story. 2025 was born at midnight on Caroline Island in Kiribati, an uninhabited atoll that happens to be the first patch of land after the International Date Line. This puts the Moon in 2025&#8217;s sixth house: it&#8217;ll be a humble, housebound year, sickly, mildly feeble. There might not be another pandemic, but it&#8217;ll feel like there is. Venus is in the seventh house, the House of Balance. This year will be dowdy, unsexy; not necessarily unfulfilling but basically passionless. A cultural trend away from both expressive blue-haired perversion and frothing inceldom, towards a generally neutral erotic stasis. Mars is in the twelfth house: the sector of the sky reserved for dreams, mystery, the shadow, the unthinking parts of the mind. There will be secret wars. Nameless conflicts fought underground. The same goes for the culture war: you will no longer know what to call your enemy, or even what side you yourself are on. </p><p>But I know, because I&#8217;ve heard it on the mountain. This is what I can tell you about your year:</p><h4>Politics is already over</h4><p>Two big things allegedly happened while I was away. Firstly, the Assad regime in Syria&#8212;which had survived over thirteen years of civil war, clawing back almost all its former territory inch by shell-blasted inch&#8212;completely collapsed in a rebel offensive that barely lasted a week. During the middle of the offensive, the CEO of a major American health insurance firm was assassinated in broad daylight in New York. The alleged killer turned out to be a handsome and charming twenty-six-year-old with sexy eyebrows and an impressive physique, and he became an instant folk hero. Crowds cheer Luigi Mangione as he&#8217;s paraded into a courtroom. Crowds wave revolutionary flags in the old centre of Damascus. Some of them are dressed like SpongeBob SquarePants. Everything seems fluid again. Politics is back; history is back; big mass energies are being unleashed, the world can be overthrown in an instant&#8230; </p><p>I&#8217;m not so sure. Last year, I prophesied that one single political event, the US presidential election, would not happen. This time, I may as well go double or quits. <em>There will be absolutely no political events whatsoever in 2025</em>.</p><p>I think this is actually a fairly reasonable prediction, since basically everything that passes for politics turns out to be something else. Look at Syria. How did the regime fall so fast? The government forces that had held the state together by killing maybe half a million of its citizens seemed to suddenly dissolve into nothing. There was no great last stand, not even in the capital, not even in the Alawite regions along the coast. The chemical weapons stayed in their silos. No cities pounded into rubble. No long gruelling battles. The entire country was won and lost with only a few hundred casualties on each side. The reason the regime fell so quickly is that <em>there was no regime</em>. Bashar al-Assad might have lingered around his palace in Damascus, a great gormless national ghost, but his government was essentially overthrown maybe a decade ago. Syria was <em>actually</em> governed by an intricate feudal patchwork of local militia, armed tribes, mafia groups, religious orders, narco gangs, reconciled rebels, and foreign actors. All of these ruled their own minor fiefdoms through various forms of extortion, criminality, and terror, but the only ones with any real military capacity were the foreign actors. In 2024, Iran and Hezbollah had bigger problems than the fate of the world&#8217;s biggest captagon factory, and pulled out. The wave that followed wasn&#8217;t really an offensive in any conventional sense. All these local fiefs simply changed the patches on their camo jackets. Before, they had been sitting in plastic chairs, smoking and collecting bribes while calling themselves the Syrian Arab Army. Now, they&#8217;re doing it while calling themselves the Syrian Salvation Government. There&#8217;s one fewer Damascene with a head like a toilet brush, and one more in Moscow. Aside from that, essentially nothing has changed. </p><p>Syria is the model for everything that will appear to happen in 2025. There will be no events. There will be no shifts. The entire discourse of politics will spiral into irrelevance. What you will get, though, are various versions of an amphetamine gang sewing new patches onto their shirts. </p><p>There was a very palpable disappointment from dead-end political commentators when the mystery health insurance assassin was finally named as Luigi Mangione, because Mangione&#8217;s politics were seemingly impossible to place. He liked Joe Rogan, the notion of masculinity, and <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, but he also disliked climate change, Jordan Peterson, and, clearly, the private healthcare system. According to his Goodreads, he&#8217;d read the Unambomber manifesto, but given it a lukewarm four-star review. Meanwhile, he gave five stars to something called <em>The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future</em>. He appears to have been the only person ever radicalised into violence by TED talks. The consensus is that Mangione&#8217;s politics were <em>incoherent</em>: he took bits and pieces from various systems of thought and combined them into a misshapen ideological golem of his own design. But his politics were perfectly coherent, they just weren&#8217;t a politics.</p><p>What Mangione ultimately believed in was an ideology of <em>personal optimisation</em>. This is what&#8217;s left after all politics have been exhausted, the 2010s left and the 2020s right. There&#8217;s still the relentless need to improve <em>something</em>, but it&#8217;s no longer directed outwards. As we&#8217;ve discovered, another world is not actually possible, but there are ways to live better in this one. You can cut down on caffeine and pornography, organise your notebooks, work out more efficiently at the gym, and listen to podcasts that nourish your brain instead of numbing it. Collective action is foreclosed, but there&#8217;s still time to get on a good nootropics stack. None of this is incoherent; it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to limit your focus to the things you can change. Or when you lift your gaze to the world at large again, it makes sense to consider all social conflicts as engineering problems. There are blockages in the free flow of smart ideas that prevent systems from running optimally. Some of those blockages can be cleared with the right information, or with mosquito nets. Some of them can be cleared with bullets. </p><p>This Tim Urbanism-Andrew Hubermanism is not the only nonpolitical ideology circulating. There&#8217;s a closely related variant that encourages you to get into massive debt buying crypto and bad art. There was one that prescribed moral self-improvement via polyamory, weight gain, and pop music; somehow, this managed to pass itself off as &#8216;leftism&#8217; for the best part of a decade. Whatever its flavour, though, the real name for this ideology is <em>hysteria</em>.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nThe mountain is very high, and up on its summit, far above the thick wash of grey clouds that hides the truth of the world from people like you, the winds of prophecy whisper strange whisperings into my ears. I go up there for you, to hear the future on the wind. But whenever I descend from the mountain with new prophecies for the coming year, it’s to a bunch of miserable complaints from you lot. Apparently, my prophecies ‘aren’t accurate.’ Apparently, I’m just ‘making up things that sound interesting with no actual vatic quality.’ Apparently I’m ‘outperformed by every prediction market going plus a bunch of supposedly psychic aquarium creatures.’ The evidence is that in 2023 I predicted that Donald Trump would die, and he didn’t, and then in 2024 I predicted that the US election would be won by nobody, and it wasn’t. ‘The 2024 election,’ I wrote, ‘will simply never end. The rallies and debates and frenzied arguments will continue past November, through all of 2025, and out the other end.’ I’m told the Democrats are still fundraising as if there’s something at stake, but everyone else has agreed that there was in fact a winner, and it was Donald Trump. Meanwhile, I predicted that the Tories would somehow win the general election in the UK, which they didn’t, and that 2024 would feature some major act of fuckery by the Dutch, which they’ve managed to keep well hidden. It’s got to the point where I can’t so much as descend from my mountain without a mob of furious peasants braying unintelligibly at me while pointing at various misshapen vegetables whose advent I apparently failed to foresee.\nI refuse to apologise. You haven’t been up on the mountain; I have. My prophecies are perfect. You live beneath the clouds, and you simply haven’t understood.\nTake my election prophecy. Yes, I said that ‘Trump and Biden are the perma-candidates in the Forever Election; they’ll probably still be the perma-candidates long after their physical bodies have died.’ (I did correctly predict a Trump victory in September, but that doesn’t count.) Isn’t it weird, though, that the best part of a prophecy supposedly about how immovable Trump and Biden are was instead devoted to Kamala Harris? In the depths of last winter, I somehow had a vision of the Brat Summer that was coming. This is how prophecy works. There are wheels within wheels here; it takes a subtle reader to look past the overt content and see how I was actually completely right all along. Most readers are not subtle readers. But I think you might be. I don’t know how I can tell, but I have this strange sense that you’re better and smarter than the dumb pigs who read my prophecies. You see what’s really going on. You aren’t fooled by the surfaces of things…\nIf you need any more evidence, though, I’ll just point out that one year ago I wrote that while AI wouldn’t replace literary prose, it would start replacing ordinary conversation. ‘Increasingly, your messages to your group chat will be written by AI. The machines will communicate for everyone in the same friendly, even tone, and everyone’s group chat will contain the same roster of mildly funny memes. You will look at them and feel nothing, and push a button to generate your response.’ Apple is now advertising my nightmares as a nifty new feature. I prophesied that all the Simone Weil-inflected flirtation with religious dogma had reached a cultural saturation point and we’d be heading back towards a kind of resurgent Even Newer Atheism, and last year the Grey Tribe scored its first act of spectacular public violence, which is basically a Bar Mitzvah for ideologies. (More on that later.) I prophesied that the new alternative media would start to recede, and everything would return to being consolidated around a few big mainstream outlets, and this has turned out truer than I ever imagined: in fact, this year’s most lively topic of debate on Substack, the home of lively debate, is how much worse Substack is than traditional magazine publishing.\nIf the overt meanings of last year’s prophecies were sometimes confusing, though, it can only be because I arrived at them in part through a three-card Tarot draw. I saw the year unfold in the Hermit, the Page of Pentacles, and the King of Pentacles. But the Tarot is a subtle instrument, and reading it requires digging through many strata of meaning, all of them obscure. Maybe you need a clearer, more scientific approach. Luckily, we have one.\nThe year 2025 was born on January 1st, 2025, which makes it a Capricorn. Capricorn is an Earth sign, grounded, plodding, materialistic; one of the draught animals of the Zodiac. It’s under the rulership of Saturn: the melancholy king at the edge of space, who sets the limit and imposes the law, god of age and time. The obvious conclusion is that 2025 will not be a year of revolutions. We’ll see more reactionary retrenchment, more state crackdowns, more grey normality over the earth. The only problem is that every year is a Capricorn, since they all begin in early January. 1789 was a Capricorn; 1968 was a Capricorn. The numbered calendar year is always a Capricorn because the numbered calendar year is a bureaucratic imposition on the wild flows of time. Fortunately, we’re not limited to sun sign astrology, but the planets all seem to be telling the same story. 2025 was born at midnight on Caroline Island in Kiribati, an uninhabited atoll that happens to be the first patch of land after the International Date Line. This puts the Moon in 2025’s sixth house: it’ll be a humble, housebound year, sickly, mildly feeble. There might not be another pandemic, but it’ll feel like there is. Venus is in the seventh house, the House of Balance. This year will be dowdy, unsexy; not necessarily unfulfilling but basically passionless. A cultural trend away from both expressive blue-haired perversion and frothing inceldom, towards a generally neutral erotic stasis. Mars is in the twelfth house: the sector of the sky reserved for dreams, mystery, the shadow, the unthinking parts of the mind. There will be secret wars. Nameless conflicts fought underground. The same goes for the culture war: you will no longer know what to call your enemy, or even what side you yourself are on.\nBut I know, because I’ve heard it on the mountain. This is what I can tell you about your year:\nPolitics is already over\nTwo big things allegedly happened while I was away. Firstly, the Assad regime in Syria—which had survived over thirteen years of civil war, clawing back almost all its former territory inch by shell-blasted inch—completely collapsed in a rebel offensive that barely lasted a week. During the middle of the offensive, the CEO of a major American health insurance firm was assassinated in broad daylight in New York. The alleged killer turned out to be a handsome and charming twenty-six-year-old with sexy eyebrows and an impressive physique, and he became an instant folk hero. Crowds cheer Luigi Mangione as he’s paraded into a courtroom. Crowds wave revolutionary flags in the old centre of Damascus. Some of them are dressed like SpongeBob SquarePants. Everything seems fluid again. Politics is back; history is back; big mass energies are being unleashed, the world can be overthrown in an instant…\nI’m not so sure. Last year, I prophesied that one single political event, the US presidential election, would not happen. This time, I may as well go double or quits. There will be absolutely no political events whatsoever in 2025.\nI think this is actually a fairly reasonable prediction, since basically everything that passes for politics turns out to be something else. Look at Syria. How did the regime fall so fast? The government forces that had held the state together by killing maybe half a million of its citizens seemed to suddenly dissolve into nothing. There was no great last stand, not even in the capital, not even in the Alawite regions along the coast. The chemical weapons stayed in their silos. No cities pounded into rubble. No long gruelling battles. The entire country was won and lost with only a few hundred casualties on each side. The reason the regime fell so quickly is that there was no regime. Bashar al-Assad might have lingered around his palace in Damascus, a great gormless national ghost, but his government was essentially overthrown maybe a decade ago. Syria was actually governed by an intricate feudal patchwork of local militia, armed tribes, mafia groups, religious orders, narco gangs, reconciled rebels, and foreign actors. All of these ruled their own minor fiefdoms through various forms of extortion, criminality, and terror, but the only ones with any real military capacity were the foreign actors. In 2024, Iran and Hezbollah had bigger problems than the fate of the world’s biggest captagon factory, and pulled out. The wave that followed wasn’t really an offensive in any conventional sense. All these local fiefs simply changed the patches on their camo jackets. Before, they had been sitting in plastic chairs, smoking and collecting bribes while calling themselves the Syrian Arab Army. Now, they’re doing it while calling themselves the Syrian Salvation Government. There’s one fewer Damascene with a head like a toilet brush, and one more in Moscow. Aside from that, essentially nothing has changed.\nSyria is the model for everything that will appear to happen in 2025. There will be no events. There will be no shifts. The entire discourse of politics will spiral into irrelevance. What you will get, though, are various versions of an amphetamine gang sewing new patches onto their shirts.\nThere was a very palpable disappointment from dead-end political commentators when the mystery health insurance assassin was finally named as Luigi Mangione, because Mangione’s politics were seemingly impossible to place. He liked Joe Rogan, the notion of masculinity, and Atlas Shrugged, but he also disliked climate change, Jordan Peterson, and, clearly, the private healthcare system. According to his Goodreads, he’d read the Unambomber manifesto, but given it a lukewarm four-star review. Meanwhile, he gave five stars to something called The Bullet Journal Method: Track the Past, Order the Present, Design the Future. He appears to have been the only person ever radicalised into violence by TED talks. The consensus is that Mangione’s politics were incoherent: he took bits and pieces from various systems of thought and combined them into a misshapen ideological golem of his own design. But his politics were perfectly coherent, they just weren’t a politics.\nWhat Mangione ultimately believed in was an ideology of personal optimisation. This is what’s left after all politics have been exhausted, the 2010s left and the 2020s right. There’s still the relentless need to improve something, but it’s no longer directed outwards. As we’ve discovered, another world is not actually possible, but there are ways to live better in this one. You can cut down on caffeine and pornography, organise your notebooks, work out more efficiently at the gym, and listen to podcasts that nourish your brain instead of numbing it. Collective action is foreclosed, but there’s still time to get on a good nootropics stack. None of this is incoherent; it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to limit your focus to the things you can change. Or when you lift your gaze to the world at large again, it makes sense to consider all social conflicts as engineering problems. There are blockages in the free flow of smart ideas that prevent systems from running optimally. Some of those blockages can be cleared with the right information, or with mosquito nets. Some of them can be cleared with bullets.\nThis Tim Urbanism-Andrew Hubermanism is not the only nonpolitical ideology circulating. There’s a closely related variant that encourages you to get into massive debt buying crypto and bad art. There was one that prescribed moral self-improvement via polyamory, weight gain, and pop music; somehow, this managed to pass itself off as ‘leftism’ for the best part of a decade. Whatever its flavour, though, the real name for this ideology is hysteria. All this working on yourself, approaching your own self like a raw material in the production process—who am I? who am I?—means looking at yourself from the outside, through the eyes of someone or something else. The actual question: who am I to you? The trace of some shapeless, nameless, unidentifiable Other, the one you do it for, the one who would finally be able to tell you what you are.\nPeople are tired of politics, not because politics has become too hysterical, but because in an age of stasis and patch-switching, politics is no longer an effective framework for their hysteria. It’s no longer satisfying to answer the question who am I to the other with a load of culture-war blather. Now, even political terrorism can become a form of self-improvement. In 2025, the new apoloticism will colonise even more beloved, old-fashioned political forms. The second Donald Trump presidency will be dominated by a kind of apolitical populism, directed more against seed oils and xenoestrogens than imports, migrants, or the liberal classes. (The end of last year saw a minor civil war within the MAGA movement over the H1B visa. On one side, a lingering residue of mawkish reactionaries who genuinely thought Trump would send all the foreigners home; on the other, Trump’s new coterie of fundamentally apolitical Silicon Valley solutionists, with firms powered by migrant labour.

This is what everyone tells you to do: get out of the big cities and experience the calm and tranquility of small-town India. I&#8217;m just not sure you&#8217;re supposed to do it in Bihar. Even my Indian friends were very concerned to learn I was coming here, because among Indians Bihar has the same bad reputation India has in the rest of the world. According to the stereotype, Bihar is flat, dusty, polluted, chaotic, and poor. It has far too many people, and while they&#8217;re all wonderful on an individual level, genuine and hardworking, they&#8217;re also generally considered to be ignorant, illiterate, toothless, crippled petty criminals who practice rape as a form of light entertainment. Biharis keep migrating to greener, more prosperous parts of India, where they live in shanties and work for drastically lower wages than the locals, who often quickly and violently turn against them. In Bihar itself the bridges keep collapsing, the politicians keep getting arrested for corruption, and the rural population keep committing gory caste massacres in what&#8217;s effectively an undeclared civil war. Unfortunately, this stereotype comes with statistics. Bihar is India&#8217;s second-largest state, with nearly 130 million people. 89% of them live in rural areas, more than anywhere outside the Himalayas. It has the lowest average income, lowest GDP per capita, and highest poverty rate in the country. If Bihar were an independent country, it would be the tenth largest in the world, with more people than Japan or Mexico. It would also instantly become one of the poorest countries on the planet, behind such beacons of development as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan. A population the size of Russia, forgotten under the belly of the world, and living at the extremes of human misery.</p><p>My train arrived just before six in the evening, which was a problem. Despite spanning nearly two thousand miles from east to west, India only has one time zone, which means that in the eastern regions it gets dark early, and the one thing everyone had told me about Bihar was that I should not go out at night. There&#8217;s no nightlife here. No cocktail bars. People drink, but they drink at home, and mostly just so they can beat their wives. There is no good reason to be on the streets after dark. Stay in your hotel and try not to make too much noise. You should absolutely not attempt to travel overland at night. The countryside teems with throat-slitting bandits, and tourists are routinely robbed. Unfortunately, our hotel was a good long drive from the train station, in a small town upriver surrounded by lots of dark, empty fields. One of my Indian friends told me to watch out for a cop outside the station. If we tried to arrange a lift without a cop&#8217;s help, there was a chance the driver would pull into a dark rural track, threaten me and my girlfriend with a knife, take our money and passports, and then leave our bodies by the side of the road. If we asked the policeman to find us a car, this was essentially guaranteed. Afterwards, the cop would get half the take.</p><p>So as our car squeaked and clattered over an unmarked and barely paved road, I kept the optimal route open on my phone, staring at the blue dot as it moved down along the blue line. As long as we&#8217;re on the line, everything&#8217;s fine. Nothing will hurt me as long as we&#8217;re on the line. It took about five minutes before the driver suddenly veered off it. Now we were on a lightless dirt track surrounded by low and lumpy mud huts. My girlfriend and I looked warily at each other. This is it, I thought. This is the day they&#8217;re finally going to hack me to death. We trundled deeper into the backlands, as our driver hummed a benign little tune to himself. I should do something, I thought. I could try to reach over and grab the wheel. I could garrotte him with my shoelace. I could refuse to go quietly. But instead, I noticed, I&#8217;m doing nothing. Any second now he&#8217;s going to pull over, drag me out the car, and cut me into thin slices with a machete, and I&#8217;m doing nothing. I&#8217;m watching the blue dot on my phone as it moves further and further in the wrong direction. But it was impossible to imagine that this ordinary car journey would really be what made the sun and the stars go out forever. That I could spend the next five minutes getting mildly carsick by scrolling on Instagram, and then be violently murdered at the end. The genres didn&#8217;t match. As long as I keep looking at my phone and doing nothing, I thought, this won&#8217;t turn into a struggle to the death in a moving vehicle. Pretend everything&#8217;s normal, and maybe I won&#8217;t even feel the blow that kills me&#8230;</p><p>The next morning, in the hotel room, I felt a bit silly about the whole thing. Clearly, I&#8217;d let myself be influenced by a cruel stereotype about this place. In reality, Bihar might have its struggles, but where doesn&#8217;t? It&#8217;s still a basically ordinary place, inhabited by basically ordinary people. In fact, we&#8217;d met some honeymooning Biharis in the south, and they&#8217;d been wonderful. They even gave me their phone number in case I decided to come to Patna. I&#8217;ve been in India long enough, I decided; there&#8217;s nothing here I haven&#8217;t seen before. And then, full of confidence, I went outside.</p><p>The hotel is on a squiggle of paved road running through the centre of town, loud with the beeping of motorcyclists as they fail to thread their way through the crowds. Away from there, the whole place crumbles into filth. My phone took us on a walk along a street that turned out to have been repurposed as an open sewer, fringed with green slime. Since no one drives down here any more, people have built shanties in the middle of it. They live directly on top of the slurry. Behind the Punjab National Bank there&#8217;s an enormous pit of sodden garbage. Black squealing piglets darting around between heaps of plastic and human waste. A corrugated-iron shack is luxury. People live in low hovels made of cow dung. They cook their food over burning cow-dung cakes. It&#8217;s a grey land: this is the breadbasket of India, but there&#8217;s something unwholesome about the earth here. This country imagines itself in lush green meadows, happy cows chomping on the grass, wooden pails full of pure white milk, vegetarianism, kindness towards all living creatures&#8212;and meanwhile, here in its agricultural heartland, the soil is all dust and famished, full of heavy metals, and the vegetables in the market stalls come scraggly and misshapen, shrivelled onions, anaemic tomatoes, limp scrags of cauliflowers, aubergines already rotting inside before they&#8217;re ripe. Nothing is fruitful. Nothing is plump.</p><p>The people come out the same way. This land mangles its inhabitants. In <em>Tristes Tropiques</em>, L&#233;vi-Strauss sketches out a brief, non-structuralist account of the caste system: India simply has too many people, scratching out a living from a soil exhausted by six thousand years of intensive agriculture. &#8216;When a community becomes too numerous, however great the genius of its thinkers, it can only endure by secreting enslavement. Once men begin to feel cramped in their geographical, social and mental habitat, they are in danger of being tempted by the simple solution of denying one section of the species the right to be considered as human. This allows the rest a little elbow-room for a few more decades. Then it becomes necessary to extend the process of expulsion.&#8217; In the end, you come to twenty-first century Bihar, where outright slavery has swallowed millions. The crowds that push and shove in front of each other are composed of the stunted and the afflicted. People with limbs bent in the wrong direction, joints locked, huge fibrous swellings, graceless zombie-walking, or some with parts of their bodies eaten away, skin asteroid-studded by parasites, withered legs all bone and nothing else, useless flappers for hands, red obliterated feet, some deformed from birth and some bashed or crushed until all the useful tendons and ligaments dissolve into swollen jelly, and some scattered people with their tongues loose, drooling, or looking up in boredom as small flies suck the moisture from the corners of their lips. </p><p>But the worst were the children. As soon as we stepped outside, the children started converging on us. Some of the children are barely five years old, but they wander the streets in pink pyjamas grey with dust, and their hair and faces are dust-grey too. Some of the children carry even younger children around with them, along with empty milk bottles. They walk up to you and start tapping you on the hand, or the thigh, or however high up they can reach, and ask for money. I didn&#8217;t want to give the children any money. Some of the local schools here have banners over the door that say &#8216;DON&#8217;T MAKE THEM BEG&#8212;LET YOUR CHILDREN LEARN,&#8217; but a lot of parents seem to think that making them beg is the more lucrative option, and I didn&#8217;t want to prove them right. Instead, I decided to make a big donation to a charity working with Bihari street children. (I went with one called Rescue Junction; you can support their work <a href=\"https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/support-street-children-in-india/\">here</a>.) But I wasn&#8217;t sure that telling the children I&#8217;d supported a charity that might maybe help someone like them at an unspecified point in the future would really be enough. My girlfriend had the idea of buying some fruit, so we&#8217;d have something to give other than money. I was doubtful: as soon as she offered them a nice apple, I said, they&#8217;d start tapping her wrist even more insistently. No, no fruit, money, money. But we bought some bananas from a street vendor anyway. </p><p>A few children hung around us, watching curiously. The moment she offered the first banana, they surged. Suddenly, my girlfriend was at the centre of a scrum of hungry pleas and snatching hands. She soon stopped even trying to dole out the fruit; she just stood helplessly, holding the bag as dozens of tiny fingers scrabbled through the plastic to grab a fistful of mushy bananas. The whole thing lasted less than thirty seconds, and afterwards the children all loped away without a word. There was only one left, a little boy who hadn&#8217;t managed to get a banana in time. He stood alone in the dust and bawled.</p><p>In the end, I think it would have been much less upsetting if the children had insisted on money instead.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1049706,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArID!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e677d0d-0608-4522-8b2e-8957e868fb08_2394x1796.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>A month ago and half a world away, I was lucky enough to spend some of my time in Mumbai with <a href=\"https://kandivalilocal.substack.com/\">Prithvi Pudhiarkar</a>, the poet laureate of Kandivali. (You should start reading him now; that way you can say you were on board before he went global.) Prithvi showed us the austere sacred caves overlooking the skyscrapers of the northern suburbs. The difference between India and the West, he said, is how we deal with suffering. India recognises that suffering is an inextricable part of life. The whole of Indian philosophy and mysticism is an attempt to overcome that suffering through deep mental discipline. You distance yourself from your own senses. Withdraw from the noisy world. The West, meanwhile, has tried to eliminate suffering by crude mechanical means. And in a way, that project has been incredibly successful. Once, the cities of Europe also had open cesspits, marching cripples, five-year-old beggars, and feral pigs eating human shit. Not any more. Back home, the kind of screaming poverty that&#8217;s grinding a hundred million Biharis into the dirt is gone. We&#8217;ve decided that the point of life is to be happy all the time, and so we banished human suffering from the visible realm. No one sees it; everyone publicly pretends that it doesn&#8217;t exist. But it does exist. Suffering really is an inextricable part of human existence; sooner or later, it will come for you, and the West simply has no good way of dealing with it. One of the most visible signs of the social decay in Western countries is opiate addiction. We experience physical or mental suffering and can&#8217;t cope, so we take painkillers, and in the end we get addicted to the act of blotting out our own pain. Prithvi imagined himself visiting me in London, and looking compassionately at all the lost and battered Westerners on the street. Businessmen in raincoats. Freelance programmers. Poor things: their lives are so hard, it really makes you count your blessings; just think, it&#8217;s a pure cosmic fluke that you were born in India and not somewhere miserable like here&#8230;</p><p>I think Prithvi&#8217;s insight is basically true, precisely because it&#8217;s such a big, sweeping generalisation. Yes, the West has a long stoic tradition; yes, the Indian approach to suffering has been part of our philosophy since Schopenhauer, and maybe since Pythagoras; yes, there are plenty of Indians who seem to think they can buy their way out of suffering, from the crorepatis in gilded penthouses to the beggars in the street. It doesn&#8217;t matter. The most boring thing about our age is its urge to nitpick, to needle for counterexamples. But there&#8217;s one counterexample to his thesis that&#8217;s been preying on me here in Bihar, which is the story of King Suddhodana.</p><p>Suddhodana lived around two and a half thousand years ago. The state he ruled was on the hilly, half-civilised fringes of the Gangetic plain, and it wasn&#8217;t really a kingdom. What government existed was carried out by a kind of tribal council of aristocratic warlords; Suddhodana happened to be the most powerful warlord in one particular clan. What matters is that for whatever reason, when his first son was born Suddhodana decided that this boy should get to live a life without any kind of suffering. He shouldn&#8217;t even experience a single negative thought. The prince grew up without ever leaving his father&#8217;s palace, which had been built as a kind of fortress against reality. Inside, everyone was young and beautiful. Any servants who fell ill were instantly dismissed. In the vast, lush gardens, the flowers were constantly uprooted and replaced so they appeared to be blooming all year round. The boy grew up happy, pampered, and stupid. He had never met a human being who wasn&#8217;t there to serve him, and all of them were constantly grinning. He knew the world existed only for his entertainment. He had never encountered sickness, age, or death. Two and a half thousand years ago, on the edge of India, Suddhodana invented the first world.</p><p>It didn&#8217;t work out the way he&#8217;d planned, though. The boy stayed in the walls of his palace until he was a man, twenty-nine years of chocolate for dinner, but eventually he got frustrated with the place. Since frustration is a form of suffering, Suddhodana had to let him go. But he prepared: before the prince left, he had the city cleaned, hung with banners, strewn with petals, and all the ugly people exiled to the hills. When his son emerged from the gate, it was to crowds of beautiful youths maniacally grinning at him. Still, you can&#8217;t sanitise the entire world. Not long into his tour, the price spotted, swaying on the edge of the adoring crowd, a feverish man with his face covered in pustules. In his dumb kindness he tried to rush over and help him, but his servants held him back. They explained that this man was sick, and if the prince came too close he&#8217;d get sick too. Later on there was the shadow of a bent-over crone, toothless and demented, and the prince tried to help her too. His servants were forced to tell him that there was nothing he could do; she was just old. Once, she was young. If you&#8217;re lucky, it&#8217;ll happen to you. When the prince saw a dead body being carried to the cremation pyre, he didn&#8217;t rush over to help this motionless man with his mouth open and his glazed-over eyes. He already knew. Finally, he saw an ascetic sitting emaciated and motionless on the ground, and his servants explained that this was a holy man, who performed gruelling austerities to escape the suffering of the world. Suddenly, the world seemed incredibly full of suffering. The prince decided to leave his father&#8217;s kingdom, renounce the world, and become a wandering ascetic. So he wandered the flat Gangetic plain, and saw suffering. He visited the holy city of Varanasi, where corpses are burned all day and all night by the banks of the Ganges, and saw death. He only ate a single jujube every day; he even tried to stop himself breathing. &#8216;My backside became like a camel's hoof; the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads; my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn.&#8217; Somehow, none of this put an end to the suffering of the world, so after a few years of terrible austerities he started eating again. Eventually he came to a secluded place by the side of a river, and sat under a tree for seven weeks, deep in meditation. After seven weeks, he woke out the sleep he&#8217;d been in his entire life. You know the son of Suddhodana as the Awakened One. The Sanskrit word is <em>Buddha</em>.</p><p>I&#8217;m in this dusty, poisoned town in Bihar because this particular dusty, poisoned town is Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. According to tradition, this ground is sacred: if the prince had his realisation on any other patch of soil, the psychic shockwave unleashed by his ascent to Buddhahood would have torn a hole right through the earth itself. This is why this town is populated by cripples and beggars, who crowd here from every corner of Bihar to coax a few rupees out of the foreign pilgrims. This sacred slum is my last stop: from here, I start the journey back home to London. But without realising it, I&#8217;ve followed the Buddha&#8217;s path, winding along the north Indian plain through Varanasi until I arrived at this particular spot in Bihar. Like the Buddha, I have grown up in a pleasure-palace fortified against reality; like the Buddha, I have seen a lot of things that upset me. Maybe this is the place where I&#8217;ll finally wake up.</p><h4>A sick man: Delhi</h4>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-finale-the-fire-sermon\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

Paid subscribers have joined us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s one last journey in search of the secret that’s been hidden in this country for two and a half thousand years. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from a small town in the lower Ganges valley. This is what everyone tells you to do: get out of the big cities and experience the calm and tranquility of small-town India. I’m just not sure you’re supposed to do it in Bihar. Even my Indian friends were very concerned to learn I was coming here, because among Indians Bihar has the same bad reputation India has in the rest of the world. According to the stereotype, Bihar is flat, dusty, polluted, chaotic, and poor. It has far too many people, and while they’re all wonderful on an individual level, genuine and hardworking, they’re also generally considered to be ignorant, illiterate, toothless, crippled petty criminals who practice rape as a form of light entertainment. Biharis keep migrating to greener, more prosperous parts of India, where they live in shanties and work for drastically lower wages than the locals, who often quickly and violently turn against them. In Bihar itself the bridges keep collapsing, the politicians keep getting arrested for corruption, and the rural population keep committing gory caste massacres in what’s effectively an undeclared civil war. Unfortunately, this stereotype comes with statistics. Bihar is India’s second-largest state, with nearly 130 million people. 89% of them live in rural areas, more than anywhere outside the Himalayas. It has the lowest average income, lowest GDP per capita, and highest poverty rate in the country. If Bihar were an independent country, it would be the tenth largest in the world, with more people than Japan or Mexico. It would also instantly become one of the poorest countries on the planet, behind such beacons of development as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan. A population the size of Russia, forgotten under the belly of the world, and living at the extremes of human misery.\nMy train arrived just before six in the evening, which was a problem. Despite spanning nearly two thousand miles from east to west, India only has one time zone, which means that in the eastern regions it gets dark early, and the one thing everyone had told me about Bihar was that I should not go out at night. There’s no nightlife here. No cocktail bars. People drink, but they drink at home, and mostly just so they can beat their wives. There is no good reason to be on the streets after dark. Stay in your hotel and try not to make too much noise. You should absolutely not attempt to travel overland at night. The countryside teems with throat-slitting bandits, and tourists are routinely robbed. Unfortunately, our hotel was a good long drive from the train station, in a small town upriver surrounded by lots of dark, empty fields. One of my Indian friends told me to watch out for a cop outside the station. If we tried to arrange a lift without a cop’s help, there was a chance the driver would pull into a dark rural track, threaten me and my girlfriend with a knife, take our money and passports, and then leave our bodies by the side of the road. If we asked the policeman to find us a car, this was essentially guaranteed. Afterwards, the cop would get half the take.\nSo as our car squeaked and clattered over an unmarked and barely paved road, I kept the optimal route open on my phone, staring at the blue dot as it moved down along the blue line. As long as we’re on the line, everything’s fine. Nothing will hurt me as long as we’re on the line. It took about five minutes before the driver suddenly veered off it. Now we were on a lightless dirt track surrounded by low and lumpy mud huts. My girlfriend and I looked warily at each other. This is it, I thought. This is the day they’re finally going to hack me to death. We trundled deeper into the backlands, as our driver hummed a benign little tune to himself. I should do something, I thought. I could try to reach over and grab the wheel. I could garrotte him with my shoelace. I could refuse to go quietly. But instead, I noticed, I’m doing nothing. Any second now he’s going to pull over, drag me out the car, and cut me into thin slices with a machete, and I’m doing nothing. I’m watching the blue dot on my phone as it moves further and further in the wrong direction. But it was impossible to imagine that this ordinary car journey would really be what made the sun and the stars go out forever. That I could spend the next five minutes getting mildly carsick by scrolling on Instagram, and then be violently murdered at the end. The genres didn’t match. As long as I keep looking at my phone and doing nothing, I thought, this won’t turn into a struggle to the death in a moving vehicle. Pretend everything’s normal, and maybe I won’t even feel the blow that kills me…\nThe next morning, in the hotel room, I felt a bit silly about the whole thing. Clearly, I’d let myself be influenced by a cruel stereotype about this place. In reality, Bihar might have its struggles, but where doesn’t? It’s still a basically ordinary place, inhabited by basically ordinary people. In fact, we’d met some honeymooning Biharis in the south, and they’d been wonderful. They even gave me their phone number in case I decided to come to Patna. I’ve been in India long enough, I decided; there’s nothing here I haven’t seen before. And then, full of confidence, I went outside.\nThe hotel is on a squiggle of paved road running through the centre of town, loud with the beeping of motorcyclists as they fail to thread their way through the crowds. Away from there, the whole place crumbles into filth. My phone took us on a walk along a street that turned out to have been repurposed as an open sewer, fringed with green slime. Since no one drives down here any more, people have built shanties in the middle of it. They live directly on top of the slurry. Behind the Punjab National Bank there’s an enormous pit of sodden garbage. Black squealing piglets darting around between heaps of plastic and human waste. A corrugated-iron shack is luxury. People live in low hovels made of cow dung. They cook their food over burning cow-dung cakes. It’s a grey land: this is the breadbasket of India, but there’s something unwholesome about the earth here. This country imagines itself in lush green meadows, happy cows chomping on the grass, wooden pails full of pure white milk, vegetarianism, kindness towards all living creatures—and meanwhile, here in its agricultural heartland, the soil is all dust and famished, full of heavy metals, and the vegetables in the market stalls come scraggly and misshapen, shrivelled onions, anaemic tomatoes, limp scrags of cauliflowers, aubergines already rotting inside before they’re ripe. Nothing is fruitful. Nothing is plump.\nThe people come out the same way. This land mangles its inhabitants. In Tristes Tropiques, Lévi-Strauss sketches out a brief, non-structuralist account of the caste system: India simply has too many people, scratching out a living from a soil exhausted by six thousand years of intensive agriculture. ‘When a community becomes too numerous, however great the genius of its thinkers, it can only endure by secreting enslavement. Once men begin to feel cramped in their geographical, social and mental habitat, they are in danger of being tempted by the simple solution of denying one section of the species the right to be considered as human. This allows the rest a little elbow-room for a few more decades. Then it becomes necessary to extend the process of expulsion.’ In the end, you come to twenty-first century Bihar, where outright slavery has swallowed millions. The crowds that push and shove in front of each other are composed of the stunted and the afflicted. People with limbs bent in the wrong direction, joints locked, huge fibrous swellings, graceless zombie-walking, or some with parts of their bodies eaten away, skin asteroid-studded by parasites, withered legs all bone and nothing else, useless flappers for hands, red obliterated feet, some deformed from birth and some bashed or crushed until all the useful tendons and ligaments dissolve into swollen jelly, and some scattered people with their tongues loose, drooling, or looking up in boredom as small flies suck the moisture from the corners of their lips.\nBut the worst were the children. As soon as we stepped outside, the children started converging on us. Some of the children are barely five years old, but they wander the streets in pink pyjamas grey with dust, and their hair and faces are dust-grey too. Some of the children carry even younger children around with them, along with empty milk bottles. They walk up to you and start tapping you on the hand, or the thigh, or however high up they can reach, and ask for money. I didn’t want to give the children any money. Some of the local schools here have banners over the door that say ‘DON’T MAKE THEM BEG—LET YOUR CHILDREN LEARN,’ but a lot of parents seem to think that making them beg is the more lucrative option, and I didn’t want to prove them right. Instead, I decided to make a big donation to a charity working with Bihari street children. (I went with one called Rescue Junction; you can support their work here.) But I wasn’t sure that telling the children I’d supported a charity that might maybe help someone like them at an unspecified point in the future would really be enough. My girlfriend had the idea of buying some fruit, so we’d have something to give other than money. I was doubtful: as soon as she offered them a nice apple, I said, they’d start tapping her wrist even more insistently. No, no fruit, money, money. But we bought some bananas from a street vendor anyway.\nA few children hung around us, watching curiously. The moment she offered the first banana, they surged. Suddenly, my girlfriend was at the centre of a scrum of hungry pleas and snatching hands. She soon stopped even trying to dole out the fruit; she just stood helplessly, holding the bag as dozens of tiny fingers scrabbled through the plastic to grab a fistful of mushy bananas. The whole thing lasted less than thirty seconds, and afterwards the children all loped away without a word. There was only one left, a little boy who hadn’t managed to get a banana in time. He stood alone in the dust and bawled.\nIn the end, I think it would have been much less upsetting if the children had insisted on money instead.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nA month ago and half a world away, I was lucky enough to spend some of my time in Mumbai with Prithvi Pudhiarkar, the poet laureate of Kandivali. (You should start reading him now; that way you can say you were on board before he went global.) Prithvi showed us the austere sacred caves overlooking the skyscrapers of the northern suburbs. The difference between India and the West, he said, is how we deal with suffering. India recognises that suffering is an inextricable part of life. The whole of Indian philosophy and mysticism is an attempt to overcome that suffering through deep mental discipline. You distance yourself from your own senses. Withdraw from the noisy world. The West, meanwhile, has tried to eliminate suffering by crude mechanical means. And in a way, that project has been incredibly successful. Once, the cities of Europe also had open cesspits, marching cripples, five-year-old beggars, and feral pigs eating human shit. Not any more. Back home, the kind of screaming poverty that’s grinding a hundred million Biharis into the dirt is gone. We’ve decided that the point of life is to be happy all the time, and so we banished human suffering from the visible realm. No one sees it; everyone publicly pretends that it doesn’t exist. But it does exist. Suffering really is an inextricable part of human existence; sooner or later, it will come for you, and the West simply has no good way of dealing with it. One of the most visible signs of the social decay in Western countries is opiate addiction. We experience physical or mental suffering and can’t cope, so we take painkillers, and in the end we get addicted to the act of blotting out our own pain. Prithvi imagined himself visiting me in London, and looking compassionately at all the lost and battered Westerners on the street. Businessmen in raincoats. Freelance programmers. Poor things: their lives are so hard, it really makes you count your blessings; just think, it’s a pure cosmic fluke that you were born in India and not somewhere miserable like here…\nI think Prithvi’s insight is basically true, precisely because it’s such a big, sweeping generalisation. Yes, the West has a long stoic tradition; yes, the Indian approach to suffering has been part of our philosophy since Schopenhauer, and maybe since Pythagoras; yes, there are plenty of Indians who seem to think they can buy their way out of suffering, from the crorepatis in gilded penthouses to the beggars in the street. It doesn’t matter. The most boring thing about our age is its urge to nitpick, to needle for counterexamples. But there’s one counterexample to his thesis that’s been preying on me here in Bihar, which is the story of King Suddhodana.\nSuddhodana lived around two and a half thousand years ago. The state he ruled was on the hilly, half-civilised fringes of the Gangetic plain, and it wasn’t really a kingdom. What government existed was carried out by a kind of tribal council of aristocratic warlords; Suddhodana happened to be the most powerful warlord in one particular clan. What matters is that for whatever reason, when his first son was born Suddhodana decided that this boy should get to live a life without any kind of suffering. He shouldn’t even experience a single negative thought. The prince grew up without ever leaving his father’s palace, which had been built as a kind of fortress against reality. Inside, everyone was young and beautiful. Any servants who fell ill were instantly dismissed. In the vast, lush gardens, the flowers were constantly uprooted and replaced so they appeared to be blooming all year round. The boy grew up happy, pampered, and stupid. He had never met a human being who wasn’t there to serve him, and all of them were constantly grinning. He knew the world existed only for his entertainment. He had never encountered sickness, age, or death. Two and a half thousand years ago, on the edge of India, Suddhodana invented the first world.\nIt didn’t work out the way he’d planned, though. The boy stayed in the walls of his palace until he was a man, twenty-nine years of chocolate for dinner, but eventually he got frustrated with the place. Since frustration is a form of suffering, Suddhodana had to let him go. But he prepared: before the prince left, he had the city cleaned, hung with banners, strewn with petals, and all the ugly people exiled to the hills. When his son emerged from the gate, it was to crowds of beautiful youths maniacally grinning at him. Still, you can’t sanitise the entire world. Not long into his tour, the price spotted, swaying on the edge of the adoring crowd, a feverish man with his face covered in pustules. In his dumb kindness he tried to rush over and help him, but his servants held him back. They explained that this man was sick, and if the prince came too close he’d get sick too. Later on there was the shadow of a bent-over crone, toothless and demented, and the prince tried to help her too. His servants were forced to tell him that there was nothing he could do; she was just old. Once, she was young. If you’re lucky, it’ll happen to you. When the prince saw a dead body being carried to the cremation pyre, he didn’t rush over to help this motionless man with his mouth open and his glazed-over eyes. He already knew. Finally, he saw an ascetic sitting emaciated and motionless on the ground, and his servants explained that this was a holy man, who performed gruelling austerities to escape the suffering of the world. Suddenly, the world seemed incredibly full of suffering. The prince decided to leave his father’s kingdom, renounce the world, and become a wandering ascetic. So he wandered the flat Gangetic plain, and saw suffering. He visited the holy city of Varanasi, where corpses are burned all day and all night by the banks of the Ganges, and saw death. He only ate a single jujube every day; he even tried to stop himself breathing. ‘My backside became like a camel's hoof; the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads; my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn.’ Somehow, none of this put an end to the suffering of the world, so after a few years of terrible austerities he started eating again. Eventually he came to a secluded place by the side of a river, and sat under a tree for seven weeks, deep in meditation. After seven weeks, he woke out the sleep he’d been in his entire life. You know the son of Suddhodana as the Awakened One. The Sanskrit word is Buddha.\nI’m in this dusty, poisoned town in Bihar because this particular dusty, poisoned town is Bodh Gaya, where the Buddha attained enlightenment. According to tradition, this ground is sacred: if the prince had his realisation on any other patch of soil, the psychic shockwave unleashed by his ascent to Buddhahood would have torn a hole right through the earth itself. This is why this town is populated by cripples and beggars, who crowd here from every corner of Bihar to coax a few rupees out of the foreign pilgrims. This sacred slum is my last stop: from here, I start the journey back home to London. But without realising it, I’ve followed the Buddha’s path, winding along the north Indian plain through Varanasi until I arrived at this particular spot in Bihar. Like the Buddha, I have grown up in a pleasure-palace fortified against reality; like the Buddha, I have seen a lot of things that upset me. Maybe this is the place where I’ll finally wake up.\nA sick man: Delhi\nRead more",

This is the international headquarters of the Joyousness Movement, also known as the Joy-Joys, which was founded in California in 1967 and is not a cult. They&#8217;re trying to teach me meditation. I sit on a tatami mat, dressed in scratchy white robes, while an ancient, liver-spotted sub-guru wanders around, giving instructions in his New Jersey croak. When you breathe in, he says, imagine yourself as a flowah. You&#8217;re just a flowah. Feel the lightness of your body: you are a flowah. So I imagine myself as a flower. My body splayed outwards, lacerated into petals. An enormous wet sexual wound at the centre. I imagine myself bursting into cocks. A ring of thick hairy cocks all around my sugar-seeping wound. That&#8217;s a flower, that&#8217;s what a flower is; it&#8217;s the genital organ of a plant. </p><p>I think I might not be cut out for meditation. </p><p>I try to do it the way they&#8217;ve taught me. I try to simply notice these images as they rise to the surface of my consciousness, not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. It&#8217;s hard. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like inside my head. It&#8217;s a tiny place, and it keeps being invaded by a rush of spiky little demons: gnashings of fur and claws, some of them no bigger than flies, razorblades vibrating in the air, emitting stupid phrases in foreign accents, Russian, Chinese, or sometimes just wordless gibbering: my thoughts. At least, I assume they&#8217;re mine. Maybe in the same sense that the bullet that finally gets you is also yours. When they&#8217;re not exploding my body into bits and penises, my thoughts keep up a constant stream of inane bullshit. This meditation posture isn&#8217;t as comfortable as it was half an hour ago, they say. You&#8217;re hungry. You&#8217;re thirsty. You&#8217;re horny. You need to piss. One day, your skin will look like that sub-guru&#8217;s, all creased up like tissue paper, drooping from your spindly arms. And isn&#8217;t it funny to be here, in the depths of India, with so many Americans? </p><p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about America in these meditation sessions, whether I want to or not. I&#8217;m thinking about the fact that when Columbus arrived in the New World, he was looking for India. The place he actually found was only an obstacle, a gold-bearing swamp between the man and his destination. The spices and mystery of India, where half-naked holy men sit on mountains and think about nothing. Maybe this is why, when the United States was established, it couldn&#8217;t just sit still in its borders; it had to <em>keep going</em>. Press westward, continue Columbus&#8217;s trajectory, towards California and the sea. &#8216;Passage O soul to India!&#8217; Thoreau reading the <em>Gita</em> in his hut, making Walden pond into his own personal Ganges. Emerson building his new American cosmology out of refashioned scraps from the Vedas. And once the frontier closed, the tough, dusty, knife-fight encampments on that distant coast suddenly became obsessed with Indian spirituality. Reincarnation, past lives, the Universal Mind. The hippie counterculture is just the most recent model. Before that they were making tantric fire-sacrifices at the Jet Propulsion Lab; before that Swami Vivekananda had the state&#8217;s Victorian aristocracy abandoning their chintzy homes to wander the coast as holy beggars. California yearns across the sea, to India. The whole of America is just Europe&#8217;s yearning, across the centuries, for India&#8230;</p><p>The fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam is in the south of the country, sandwiched between Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. For thousands of years, great empires welled up and drained away in the valleys below. The Cholas, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagaras&#8212;while up in their inaccessible hills the Parpakai barely paid any attention. They were far too focused on chewing the mildly psychoactive bark of the tevaiya tree and building weird stone temples with twisting organic forms. Even now, this place is a nightmare to get to, but there is a rail line from Bangalore to Kanturava, the state capital. Every two days, a train clatters and wheezes up the mountains and over the rusting old bridges spanning the ravines. I stood in the vestibule, leaning out the open door, looking down into that sheer sheer drop where the green hills fade into mist. It took sixteen hours before we creaked into the station at Kanturava, the city of terraces and balconies carved into the wall of an enormous cliff, where the ladders have more traffic than the roads. Parpakainilam still barely considers itself part of India. It has the lowest enlistment rate to the Indian Armed Forces of any state, and the lowest voter turnout. None of the national political parties have ever managed to get a foothold here; instead of Congress and the BJP, the Legislative Assembly is split between the Wakefulness Party and the Party of Dreams. Parpakainilam isn&#8217;t even covered by the India Post Office; it has its own informal postal service, based on the ancient kaikku system, in which a letter is passed on, sometimes by hundreds of people, in the vague direction of the recipient. In the more remote regions it can take years to get a postcard, and this ashram is in a very remote region. It&#8217;s a six-hour drive from Kanturava, and after that you have to do the last three hours on foot, through forests and over rope bridges and past ancient stone statues wreathed in vines that inexplicably shoot fire from their mouths when you pass. It was not a nice journey. But I made here, to the White Hermitage Ashram in its damp valley, to learn about Indian mysticism and spirituality from the people who understand it best&#8212;that is, from Americans.</p><p>A day at the White Hermitage Ashram begins at five in the morning with two hours of guided meditation. After that, there&#8217;s a fire ceremony in which we worship the Universal Mind, incarnated as a marble statue of Guru Raj Hansi as he looked in the late 60s, long hair, long trailing beard, big handsome wide-open face. Then a simple, traditional ashram breakfast of foot loops and cap&#8217;n crunch, served with milk from the ashram cows and tevaiya bark for chewing, eaten in silence. After that, there&#8217;s six hours of uninterrupted work. Sweeping, cleaning, mucking out the cattle, hosing down the toilets, washing clothes, running the ashram&#8217;s social media accounts. (I keep asking to help with the animals; they keep forcing me to sit in a stuffy, windowless room and tweet.) At two in the afternoon we sit together and eat lunch, usually a big bag of crisps with more tevaiya. The next four hours are for personal reflection, meditation, study, and informal group exercises, before another aarti, a silent dinner of lentil burgers or tofu dogs, and bed. But it used to be very different. The White Hermitage Ashram is huge. Its dining hall is huge, its kitchens are huge, its laundry looks like an industrial operation. There are housing units in this valley ten storeys high. At its peak in the 1970s, there were six thousand people living, working, and praying here. Back then, before Guru Raj Hansi went into seclusion, a good chunk of the day was taken up by gurudarshan: thousands of Joy-Joys would arrange themselves around the Guru, radiantly nude, and just stare at him, enraptured, soaking up the blissful energies that radiated from his silent, smiling form. Then he would say a few, simple words. Joy is not something you are seeking, he would say. Joy is already here. This was usually followed by an enormous session of ecstatic group sex. The Joyousness Movement was casting off five thousand years of shame and jealousy. They were finding the joy bursting out everywhere from the look, the touch, the feeling of warm skin against your own. Sex is a form of meditation, one of the most powerful forms of meditation. Through pleasure or procreation, sex dissolves you into the great stream of being; it&#8217;s through sex that you can come to understand the first mahavakya, <em>tat tvam asi</em>, thou art that. You are the existent, you are the universal self, you are everything and everyone. Fall into an ocean of firm, tanned, supple flesh, without questioning whether this flesh you&#8217;re touching belongs to a friend, a stranger, a man, a woman, an adult, a child&#8230;</p><p>Apparently they do still have sexual meditation at the White Hermitage Ashram, but I haven&#8217;t seen any. Today there are about fifty Joy-Joys still here, and they are not as firm and tanned and supple as they were. They creak around the place in their orange robes, with trembling hands and purple blotches on their skin, and the ashram is in ruins. We eat in one tiny corner of the dining hall. The machinery in the laundry is all gummed up, leaking toxic sludge; we wash our clothes in the river. Trees are growing out of the roofs of the high-rises, as their roots slowly crack the concrete open. All the young sexy kids back in America are still into spirituality, but it&#8217;s a very different kind. Taylor Swift has not yet started making pop songs based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Sabrina Carpenter is not singing about how the physical universe is an illusion. The kids might still do yoga and say namaste, and they still think there&#8217;s a universal consciousness that&#8217;s ultimately identical with their own self&#8212;but they&#8217;re no longer interested in renouncing desire or achieving union with the divine. They don&#8217;t want to escape the material world. They don&#8217;t want enlightenment. They are driving their bodies like cars, and they have no interest in getting out. At no point do you have to go on any kind of pilgrimage to India. It&#8217;s all about manifesting: using the fact that you&#8217;re a facet of the Infinite Mind to <em>get the stuff you want</em>. More money, more Instagram followers. The question isn&#8217;t why Westerners became obsessed with Indian spirituality: it&#8217;s why we stopped.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-8-love-is-all\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

I sit on a tatami mat, dressed in scratchy white robes, while an ancient, liver-spotted sub-guru wanders around, giving instructions in his New Jersey croak. When you breathe in, he says, imagine yourself as a flowah. You’re just a flowah. Feel the lightness of your body: you are a flowah. So I imagine myself as a flower. My body splayed outwards, lacerated into petals. An enormous wet sexual wound at the centre. I imagine myself bursting into cocks. A ring of thick hairy cocks all around my sugar-seeping wound. That’s a flower, that’s what a flower is; it’s the genital organ of a plant.\nI think I might not be cut out for meditation.\nI try to do it the way they’ve taught me. I try to simply notice these images as they rise to the surface of my consciousness, not following them, not suppressing them either, not judging. It’s hard. You don’t know what it’s like inside my head. It’s a tiny place, and it keeps being invaded by a rush of spiky little demons: gnashings of fur and claws, some of them no bigger than flies, razorblades vibrating in the air, emitting stupid phrases in foreign accents, Russian, Chinese, or sometimes just wordless gibbering: my thoughts. At least, I assume they’re mine. Maybe in the same sense that the bullet that finally gets you is also yours. When they’re not exploding my body into bits and penises, my thoughts keep up a constant stream of inane bullshit. This meditation posture isn’t as comfortable as it was half an hour ago, they say. You’re hungry. You’re thirsty. You’re horny. You need to piss. One day, your skin will look like that sub-guru’s, all creased up like tissue paper, drooping from your spindly arms. And isn’t it funny to be here, in the depths of India, with so many Americans?\nI’ve been thinking a lot about America in these meditation sessions, whether I want to or not. I’m thinking about the fact that when Columbus arrived in the New World, he was looking for India. The place he actually found was only an obstacle, a gold-bearing swamp between the man and his destination. The spices and mystery of India, where half-naked holy men sit on mountains and think about nothing. Maybe this is why, when the United States was established, it couldn’t just sit still in its borders; it had to keep going. Press westward, continue Columbus’s trajectory, towards California and the sea. ‘Passage O soul to India!’ Thoreau reading the Gita in his hut, making Walden pond into his own personal Ganges. Emerson building his new American cosmology out of refashioned scraps from the Vedas. And once the frontier closed, the tough, dusty, knife-fight encampments on that distant coast suddenly became obsessed with Indian spirituality. Reincarnation, past lives, the Universal Mind. The hippie counterculture is just the most recent model. Before that they were making tantric fire-sacrifices at the Jet Propulsion Lab; before that Swami Vivekananda had the state’s Victorian aristocracy abandoning their chintzy homes to wander the coast as holy beggars. California yearns across the sea, to India. The whole of America is just Europe’s yearning, across the centuries, for India…\nThe fictional Indian state of Parpakainilam is in the south of the country, sandwiched between Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. For thousands of years, great empires welled up and drained away in the valleys below. The Cholas, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagaras—while up in their inaccessible hills the Parpakai barely paid any attention. They were far too focused on chewing the mildly psychoactive bark of the tevaiya tree and building weird stone temples with twisting organic forms. Even now, this place is a nightmare to get to, but there is a rail line from Bangalore to Kanturava, the state capital. Every two days, a train clatters and wheezes up the mountains and over the rusting old bridges spanning the ravines. I stood in the vestibule, leaning out the open door, looking down into that sheer sheer drop where the green hills fade into mist. It took sixteen hours before we creaked into the station at Kanturava, the city of terraces and balconies carved into the wall of an enormous cliff, where the ladders have more traffic than the roads. Parpakainilam still barely considers itself part of India. It has the lowest enlistment rate to the Indian Armed Forces of any state, and the lowest voter turnout. None of the national political parties have ever managed to get a foothold here; instead of Congress and the BJP, the Legislative Assembly is split between the Wakefulness Party and the Party of Dreams. Parpakainilam isn’t even covered by the India Post Office; it has its own informal postal service, based on the ancient kaikku system, in which a letter is passed on, sometimes by hundreds of people, in the vague direction of the recipient. In the more remote regions it can take years to get a postcard, and this ashram is in a very remote region. It’s a six-hour drive from Kanturava, and after that you have to do the last three hours on foot, through forests and over rope bridges and past ancient stone statues wreathed in vines that inexplicably shoot fire from their mouths when you pass. It was not a nice journey. But I made here, to the White Hermitage Ashram in its damp valley, to learn about Indian mysticism and spirituality from the people who understand it best—that is, from Americans.\nA day at the White Hermitage Ashram begins at five in the morning with two hours of guided meditation. After that, there’s a fire ceremony in which we worship the Universal Mind, incarnated as a marble statue of Guru Raj Hansi as he looked in the late 60s, long hair, long trailing beard, big handsome wide-open face. Then a simple, traditional ashram breakfast of foot loops and cap’n crunch, served with milk from the ashram cows and tevaiya bark for chewing, eaten in silence. After that, there’s six hours of uninterrupted work. Sweeping, cleaning, mucking out the cattle, hosing down the toilets, washing clothes, running the ashram’s social media accounts. (I keep asking to help with the animals; they keep forcing me to sit in a stuffy, windowless room and tweet.) At two in the afternoon we sit together and eat lunch, usually a big bag of crisps with more tevaiya. The next four hours are for personal reflection, meditation, study, and informal group exercises, before another aarti, a silent dinner of lentil burgers or tofu dogs, and bed. But it used to be very different. The White Hermitage Ashram is huge. Its dining hall is huge, its kitchens are huge, its laundry looks like an industrial operation. There are housing units in this valley ten storeys high. At its peak in the 1970s, there were six thousand people living, working, and praying here. Back then, before Guru Raj Hansi went into seclusion, a good chunk of the day was taken up by gurudarshan: thousands of Joy-Joys would arrange themselves around the Guru, radiantly nude, and just stare at him, enraptured, soaking up the blissful energies that radiated from his silent, smiling form. Then he would say a few, simple words. Joy is not something you are seeking, he would say. Joy is already here. This was usually followed by an enormous session of ecstatic group sex. The Joyousness Movement was casting off five thousand years of shame and jealousy. They were finding the joy bursting out everywhere from the look, the touch, the feeling of warm skin against your own. Sex is a form of meditation, one of the most powerful forms of meditation. Through pleasure or procreation, sex dissolves you into the great stream of being; it’s through sex that you can come to understand the first mahavakya, tat tvam asi, thou art that. You are the existent, you are the universal self, you are everything and everyone. Fall into an ocean of firm, tanned, supple flesh, without questioning whether this flesh you’re touching belongs to a friend, a stranger, a man, a woman, an adult, a child…\nApparently they do still have sexual meditation at the White Hermitage Ashram, but I haven’t seen any. Today there are about fifty Joy-Joys still here, and they are not as firm and tanned and supple as they were. They creak around the place in their orange robes, with trembling hands and purple blotches on their skin, and the ashram is in ruins. We eat in one tiny corner of the dining hall. The machinery in the laundry is all gummed up, leaking toxic sludge; we wash our clothes in the river. Trees are growing out of the roofs of the high-rises, as their roots slowly crack the concrete open. All the young sexy kids back in America are still into spirituality, but it’s a very different kind. Taylor Swift has not yet started making pop songs based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Sabrina Carpenter is not singing about how the physical universe is an illusion. The kids might still do yoga and say namaste, and they still think there’s a universal consciousness that’s ultimately identical with their own self—but they’re no longer interested in renouncing desire or achieving union with the divine. They don’t want to escape the material world. They don’t want enlightenment. They are driving their bodies like cars, and they have no interest in getting out. At no point do you have to go on any kind of pilgrimage to India. It’s all about manifesting: using the fact that you’re a facet of the Infinite Mind to get the stuff you want. More money, more Instagram followers. The question isn’t why Westerners became obsessed with Indian spirituality: it’s why we stopped.\nRead more",

It&#8217;s beautiful out, and I&#8217;m writing this in my swimming trunks while sipping a non-alcoholic mojito that includes, for some reason, little specks of sushi ginger floating around with the sprigs of mint. In a moment I&#8217;m going to go and get another of the best meals I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, which I will eat with my hands directly off a banana leaf. I&#8217;m enjoying a kind of holiday from my holiday, and if you&#8217;ve been following this series you&#8217;ll understand why I deserve one. (Thanks to everyone who successfully campaigned for my release; no thanks at all to the thousands of people who apparently thought my being arrested and sent to Indian jail was some kind of literary bit.) It&#8217;s nice here. I hear there&#8217;s been a cold snap back in London. I&#8217;m having an extremely nice time. </p><p>It took me three days to get down here from Mumbai, chugging along pretty much the entire length of peninsular India. When I did arrive, it was like arriving in another country. Down to the language: in the north, I&#8217;d got very used to the cadences of Hindi and Bengali and Marathi, which are all very rhythmic, rising and falling on the vowels, gummed together with consonants, <em>aapke aagey jaadu chalta hai</em>. I might not understand the words, but it&#8217;s audibly part of the same linguistic universe I come from, some distant relative of English. Here in Kerala they speak Malayalam, which is about as different from both English and Hindi as the click languages of Africa, or the Amazonian grammars where a noun&#8217;s declension depends on whether you saw it while entering or leaving the village, or the Siberian tundra-wails in which every verb has one million possible forms. In Malayalam, there are words like <em>vaidyuthiaagamanagamananiyanthranayanthram</em>, which is an electric switch. The capital of Kerala is called Thiruvananthapuram. All these words are written in a very beautiful script, which looks &#3335;&#3364;&#3393;&#3370;&#3403;&#3378;&#3398;. The round, flowing forms are because Malayalam was originally written by being cut into palm leaves with a stylus, and straight lines would have torn through the fibres. Before I arrived here, though, I was wondering how any of this would actually be pronounced&#8212;up to and including the word <em>Malayalam</em> itself, which my tongue tends to slip around on like a bad ice skater. (Malayam? Mayalayalam? It&#8217;s not just me with this problem. Other Indians default to calling the people here Mallus, which is sometimes taken as an offensive slur, but it is objectively easier.) The answer is that these words are pronounced all at once. Instead of enunciating every syllable, <em>Thi-ru-va-nan-tha-pu-ram</em>, you just mash your jaw up and down while emitting a fast rhythmic bubbling sound. It is utterly unlike anything else I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.</p><p>But everything is different here. In the north, cities and towns are scrunched fibrous cysts. Narrow brick houses packed together in the dust, all reeking of diesel fumes. Here, they sprawl. A Keralite town is more like an American suburb: big low homes with pitched roofs, dotted between wide expanses of lushly watered green. Another thing it will probably share with an American suburb is a huge gaudy church: Kerala has six million Christians, nearly a fifth of the state&#8217;s population. Also the steakhouse: in the north  of India cattle slaughter is illegal; in Kerala, even Hindus eat quite a lot of beef. But the resemblance ends there. In most of India, like most of the world, modernisation means <em>Westernisation</em>. This is why Delhi has artisan coffee shops with raw plaster on the walls, and Mumbai has some great small-plates restaurants, and every dusty town in Uttar Pradesh has a whole range of vegetarian burger bars. But Kerala is clearly guided by a different light. A white and gold aesthetic predominates. It&#8217;s hard to get a drink outside a few tourist hotels, but there are plenty of shisha bars. The fancy shops have signs in two languages: Malayalam and Arabic. Street food means dosas and uttapams but also, increasingly, shawarma. A lot of restaurants have two branches: one in Ernakulam, one in Abu Dhabi. </p><p>Kerala has always been the part of India most open to the rest of the world. Its Christian community was founded when the disciple Thomas sailed here to preach to the already long-established community of Malabar Jews. According to tradition, the first mosque in Kerala was built while Mohammed was still in exile in Medina. When Vasco de Gama arrived in India, he arrived here. So did the Dutch and the British. Today, that openness has led to a massive flow of migrant workers, remittances, health tourists, and cultural influence back and forth between Kerala and the UAE. The result is a version of India that&#8217;s visibly Christian but also Gulf Arab-flavoured. It&#8217;s also, incidentally, governed by the Communist Party, which has covered every city and every town in red hammer-and-sickle banners. At the market, the fresh fruit is sold on yesterday&#8217;s newspaper, which features a big double-page profile of Friedrich Engels, including a full explication of the <em>Naturdialektik</em> in Malayalam. It&#8217;s a weird place.</p><p>Kerala rarely comes up as a communist success story. I find this weird, since the seventy-odd years of intermittent communist government have clearly served the place well, without at any point involving any bread lines or nameless thousands shot and buried in shallow graves. Maybe this place has escaped the world&#8217;s attention because the communists in Kerala have had to do all their work in local government, where it&#8217;s harder to even <em>try</em> to abolish the value-form. Instead, they&#8217;re forced to simply administer capitalism, but it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism <em>well</em>, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party. </p><p>Before the first communist government, a good chunk of the rural population were essentially slaves; meanwhile free peasants had to give over up to 75% of their crop to their landlords. The class struggle that followed was not bloodless. Across the state, there are monuments to peasant leaders murdered by landlords during the land reform campaign. A lot of people were hacked to death in their fields; in the end the Indian government decided that the communist programme was too radical, dismissed the elected state government, and declared direct rule from Delhi. But in the end the peasants won, and today Kerala has the lowest rural poverty rate in India, under 1%. The communists empowered trade unions, and today wages here are higher than anywhere else in the country. The average Indian farmworker makes just over 300 rupees a day; in Kerala it&#8217;s more like 800. </p><p>This has led to some problems. India as a whole is growing fast, but economic growth in Kerala is sclerotic, barely above first world-level, and the state has a hard time attracting capital. (This makes sense: as a good capitalist, would you prefer to build a factory in Bihar, where desperate peasants will beg you for a job, or in Kerala, where labour costs three times as much, your workers will immediately start scheming for your surplus, and the local government won&#8217;t even bash their heads in for you but might even back them up?) But there&#8217;s one other thing that communism has historically done extremely well, which is to provide an ideological structure that efficiently mobilises urban elites to go out into the countryside and provide healthcare and education to the rural poor. (Under noncommunist ideologies they usually go for a more well-remunerated but less socially useful version, like setting up an NGO to deliver corporate trainings on social equity.) The result is a huge surplus of well-educated Keralites, and like any other surplus in a well-run capitalist economy it ends up being exported abroad. </p><p>The UAE runs on Malayali engineers. In Britain, our NHS essentially parasites itself off the communist school system of Kerala.

Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s about holy poverty and why the West is actually much more conformist than India. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from a beach in Kerala. It’s beautiful out, and I’m writing this in my swimming trunks while sipping a non-alcoholic mojito that includes, for some reason, little specks of sushi ginger floating around with the sprigs of mint. In a moment I’m going to go and get another of the best meals I’ve ever had in my life, which I will eat with my hands directly off a banana leaf. I’m enjoying a kind of holiday from my holiday, and if you’ve been following this series you’ll understand why I deserve one. (Thanks to everyone who successfully campaigned for my release; no thanks at all to the thousands of people who apparently thought my being arrested and sent to Indian jail was some kind of literary bit.) It’s nice here. I hear there’s been a cold snap back in London. I’m having an extremely nice time.\nIt took me three days to get down here from Mumbai, chugging along pretty much the entire length of peninsular India. When I did arrive, it was like arriving in another country. Down to the language: in the north, I’d got very used to the cadences of Hindi and Bengali and Marathi, which are all very rhythmic, rising and falling on the vowels, gummed together with consonants, aapke aagey jaadu chalta hai. I might not understand the words, but it’s audibly part of the same linguistic universe I come from, some distant relative of English. Here in Kerala they speak Malayalam, which is about as different from both English and Hindi as the click languages of Africa, or the Amazonian grammars where a noun’s declension depends on whether you saw it while entering or leaving the village, or the Siberian tundra-wails in which every verb has one million possible forms. In Malayalam, there are words like vaidyuthiaagamanagamananiyanthranayanthram, which is an electric switch. The capital of Kerala is called Thiruvananthapuram. All these words are written in a very beautiful script, which looks ഇതുപോലെ. The round, flowing forms are because Malayalam was originally written by being cut into palm leaves with a stylus, and straight lines would have torn through the fibres. Before I arrived here, though, I was wondering how any of this would actually be pronounced—up to and including the word Malayalam itself, which my tongue tends to slip around on like a bad ice skater. (Malayam? Mayalayalam? It’s not just me with this problem. Other Indians default to calling the people here Mallus, which is sometimes taken as an offensive slur, but it is objectively easier.) The answer is that these words are pronounced all at once. Instead of enunciating every syllable, Thi-ru-va-nan-tha-pu-ram, you just mash your jaw up and down while emitting a fast rhythmic bubbling sound. It is utterly unlike anything else I’ve ever heard in my life.\nBut everything is different here. In the north, cities and towns are scrunched fibrous cysts. Narrow brick houses packed together in the dust, all reeking of diesel fumes. Here, they sprawl. A Keralite town is more like an American suburb: big low homes with pitched roofs, dotted between wide expanses of lushly watered green. Another thing it will probably share with an American suburb is a huge gaudy church: Kerala has six million Christians, nearly a fifth of the state’s population. Also the steakhouse: in the north of India cattle slaughter is illegal; in Kerala, even Hindus eat quite a lot of beef. But the resemblance ends there. In most of India, like most of the world, modernisation means Westernisation. This is why Delhi has artisan coffee shops with raw plaster on the walls, and Mumbai has some great small-plates restaurants, and every dusty town in Uttar Pradesh has a whole range of vegetarian burger bars. But Kerala is clearly guided by a different light. A white and gold aesthetic predominates. It’s hard to get a drink outside a few tourist hotels, but there are plenty of shisha bars. The fancy shops have signs in two languages: Malayalam and Arabic. Street food means dosas and uttapams but also, increasingly, shawarma. A lot of restaurants have two branches: one in Ernakulam, one in Abu Dhabi.\nKerala has always been the part of India most open to the rest of the world. Its Christian community was founded when the disciple Thomas sailed here to preach to the already long-established community of Malabar Jews. According to tradition, the first mosque in Kerala was built while Mohammed was still in exile in Medina. When Vasco de Gama arrived in India, he arrived here. So did the Dutch and the British. Today, that openness has led to a massive flow of migrant workers, remittances, health tourists, and cultural influence back and forth between Kerala and the UAE. The result is a version of India that’s visibly Christian but also Gulf Arab-flavoured. It’s also, incidentally, governed by the Communist Party, which has covered every city and every town in red hammer-and-sickle banners. At the market, the fresh fruit is sold on yesterday’s newspaper, which features a big double-page profile of Friedrich Engels, including a full explication of the Naturdialektik in Malayalam. It’s a weird place.\nKerala rarely comes up as a communist success story. I find this weird, since the seventy-odd years of intermittent communist government have clearly served the place well, without at any point involving any bread lines or nameless thousands shot and buried in shallow graves. Maybe this place has escaped the world’s attention because the communists in Kerala have had to do all their work in local government, where it’s harder to even try to abolish the value-form. Instead, they’re forced to simply administer capitalism, but it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.\nBefore the first communist government, a good chunk of the rural population were essentially slaves; meanwhile free peasants had to give over up to 75% of their crop to their landlords. The class struggle that followed was not bloodless. Across the state, there are monuments to peasant leaders murdered by landlords during the land reform campaign. A lot of people were hacked to death in their fields; in the end the Indian government decided that the communist programme was too radical, dismissed the elected state government, and declared direct rule from Delhi. But in the end the peasants won, and today Kerala has the lowest rural poverty rate in India, under 1%. The communists empowered trade unions, and today wages here are higher than anywhere else in the country. The average Indian farmworker makes just over 300 rupees a day; in Kerala it’s more like 800.\nThis has led to some problems. India as a whole is growing fast, but economic growth in Kerala is sclerotic, barely above first world-level, and the state has a hard time attracting capital. (This makes sense: as a good capitalist, would you prefer to build a factory in Bihar, where desperate peasants will beg you for a job, or in Kerala, where labour costs three times as much, your workers will immediately start scheming for your surplus, and the local government won’t even bash their heads in for you but might even back them up?) But there’s one other thing that communism has historically done extremely well, which is to provide an ideological structure that efficiently mobilises urban elites to go out into the countryside and provide healthcare and education to the rural poor. (Under noncommunist ideologies they usually go for a more well-remunerated but less socially useful version, like setting up an NGO to deliver corporate trainings on social equity.) The result is a huge surplus of well-educated Keralites, and like any other surplus in a well-run capitalist economy it ends up being exported abroad.\nThe UAE runs on Malayali engineers. In Britain, our NHS essentially parasites itself off the communist school system of Kerala. The revolutionary workers and peasants toil for universal education, and that education is realised in an oil despot’s thirtieth mansion or a few pills for a Scouse granny’s gammy knee. In return, of course, a chunk of the much higher foreign wages ends up coming back here, so people can live well in their green God-fearing suburb with Arab aesthetics and Communist slogans on all the walls. It’s not perfect, but it works.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nI think this is not the India a lot of people are thinking about when they think about India.\nThis country has an image problem.

Siddique had been a councillor in the Municipal Corporation and a minister of state in the Maharashtra government; he&#8217;d sat on any number of important committees; he founded a political dynasty. He was gunned down by the Bishnoi gang outside his son&#8217;s constituency office for reasons unknown. Last time, I said I didn&#8217;t even know who Baba Siddique was until he was assassinated last month, and that&#8217;s true. Even so&#8212;and my lawyer has begged me not to write this bit, but my first duty is always to the truth&#8212;I&#8217;m not entirely innocent either. This is how I ended up here, and what happened next.</p><p>You have to understand what coming to Mumbai was like. For weeks, I&#8217;d been trudging around various dusty, dilapidated towns in Rajasthan, dutifully checking in on the historic palaces and the historic forts and the historic palaces inside the historic forts, half of them ruined, with bats hanging from the rafters and guano piling the floor where the tyrants of a less squalid age had once piled their gold and silks. I ate in godawful tourist restaurants with extensive menus full of burgers and fries. These people would have been horrified to discover what a burger really is, but that didn&#8217;t stop them selling any number of slimes between two buns under the name. I dodged tuktuks and human shit on narrow streets with no pavements, just a fringe of dust and heaped-up plastic, where I couldn&#8217;t walk for ten seconds without someone blocking my path&#8212;yes my friend! you want shopping? you want spend money?&#8212;proffering fake pashmina scarves or plastic idols or camel leather handbags or sometimes more ordinary things when there was nothing else to hawk, handfuls of broken masonry or bits of wood, biro caps, long ribbons of apple peel: yes my friend, you want pulp, you want chalk, you want worms? It&#8217;s a decaying world up there. Rajasthan is the most traditional, hidebound part of the country, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re interested in actually conserving the things they&#8217;ve received from the past, just that all they know how to do is moulder away. Brits and Israelis keep flocking to see the old forts and palaces, even if those forts are surrounded by a broad moat of filth; no need to live in anything other than comfortable squalor. Let it rot; all rot is picturesque. </p><p>Anyway, try to imagine what it was like for me to start the day in a dusty Rajasthani town on the edge of the desert, and arrive that evening in Mumbai. To drive down the Coastal Road and just see skyscrapers, hundreds of spindles of light all along the shore of the Arabian Sea, and more of them further inland, visible in the gaps between, thousands more: a city that <em>keeps going</em>, glittering endlessly for miles into the haze, and all of it superdense, all crushed and glowing like a neutron star. The hypercity; South Asia&#8217;s only real metropolis. In a country of one and a half billion people, this one city produces more than a third of the total tax revenue. Delhi might be big, in a strictly demographic sense, but it feels like a hypertrophied version of a poky little town. Mumbai feels <em>extraplanetary</em>. It keeps on going across the bay, into the sprawling warehouses of Navi Mumbai, liquid urban stuff flooding the hinterlands of Maharashtra; it keeps going beyond our world. Across asteroids and exoplanets there are tracts of slum housing and salvage zones, chipped signs in Hindi and Marathi in the warrens where bony stunted children take apart starships for scrap, street hawkers scurrying under skies with two suns or none at all. Coming here was like being dragged facefirst across the centuries, from the ruins of the eighteenth to the furnace of the twenty-third. </p><p>As soon as you see the skyscrapers, Mumbai&#8217;s famous slums make perfect sense. All of India floods into this one city, and I get it. If you were a Bihari peasant farmer, scraping dust out of the dust, shitting in a communal ditch, sleeping in the same one-room hut as your goats, as your ancestors had scraped and shat and slept for five thousand years&#8212;but you knew that you lived in the same country as Mumbai, this science-fiction city bursting with money and danger, you&#8217;d have to be an idiot not to go. So they come here, to live in slums. There&#8217;s no neighbourhood in Mumbai so ritzy it doesn&#8217;t have its slums. Malabar Hill has them, swelling like boils in between the towers. This is where all the energy of the city is generated. An overflowing pool of dirt-cheap labour, flooding into the cracks. Bataille once noted that nature is in constant high tension, exploding extravagantly: cut a path through a grassy field and new plants will immediately start growing in the bare earth. But you only get this rich fecundity when every individual organism is desperately poor, on the point of starvation, gasping for space in a saturated world. Mumbai is the same. If there&#8217;s six square feet of land along a railway track, or behind the back of some luxury mall, or in the gaps between office towers, someone&#8217;s already put up a lopsided corrugated-iron shack. Or, more likely, ten of them, a hundred, crammed together, sharing zero toilets. Whole families in a room, half the size of the one they shared with the goats back home.</p><p>But obviously not everyone here lives like grass. The fifty thousand dollar millionaires in this city, and the millions more in the comfortable middle classes, get to prance around in the meadow. It&#8217;s easy not to see the misery here if you don&#8217;t want to: I was too entranced by how nice it felt to be in a real city again. Mumbai has pavements. It has a big monumental downtown, partially built by the British, but mostly built by the local commercial classes in a high Victorian style. Gothic clock towers, all niches and gables. Neoclassical fountains featuring allegorical sculptures of nude women with tiny European tits, to represent Industry and Thrift and Cleanliness and Sexual Repression. Mumbai has a Zara and a Uniqlo and it&#8217;s even got Pret A Manger. Supermarkets too. Not a street market, not mud-crusted plastic buckets full of fly-crawling fruit, not skinned lambs dangling from their collarbones in the street, but shelves full of hygienically packaged products, all plastic-smooth. I could have been in Tesco. In fact, I was: the Star Bazaar supermarket chain is a 50-50 joint venture between the Tata Group and Tesco plc. And maybe it was the weird familiarity of this place that made me act out.</p><p>What you need to know is that Lawrence Bishnoi is currently India&#8217;s most feared gangster. He&#8217;s the man who orchestrated the murder of Baba Siddique; he&#8217;s also, according to the police, my boss. Bishnoi took the usual route into organised crime, which is to be born into the kind of respectable middle-class family that names its children after colonial-era British administrators, and then enter the underworld via the medium of student politics. While he was studying at Punjab University, Bishnoi ran for the student council and lost; next time, he realised that instead of risking another ordinary campaign, he could just threaten to kill anyone who voted the other way. He won, and was then promptly arrested. His time in jail changed his goals but not his strategy. This is how the Bishoi gang works: pure extortion. They don&#8217;t smuggle drugs, they don&#8217;t traffic women, they don&#8217;t make loans or organise illegal gambling; they just demand money and threaten to kill you if you don&#8217;t pay up. Sometimes, it&#8217;s true, they&#8217;ll kill you for other reasons. Bishnoi has vowed to kill the Bollywood actor Salman Khan over a 1998 poaching incident in which Khan shot an antelope. Lawrence Bishnoi comes from the Bishnoi panth, a caste of deeply religious tree-huggers from Rajasthan. In 1730, the Maharaja of Marwar sent soldiers to fell trees near a Bishnoi village for a new palace. Hundreds of villagers each wrapped their arms around a tree: if you want to cut this down, you&#8217;ll have to cut through me too. So they did: more than three hundred Bishnoi were sawn in half defending their trees. The Bishnoi worship all the gods, but they have a particular reverence for Agyana, god of blissful ignorance, and the antelope is his mount. Which is why, three hundred years later, Lawrence Bishnoi&#8217;s men fired a volley of gunshots at Salman Khan&#8217;s house. At least, that&#8217;s the official reason. But in the entertainment industry, nothing is what it seems. Not so long ago, everyone in Bollywood was gleefully murdering each other. Big men, famous men, shot down in the street so some actor could get out of a contract he didn&#8217;t like, or to secure international distribution rights for a frothy romance film with lots of song-and-dance numbers. And just when it looked like the bloodshed was finally winding down, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang moved into town with a laminated menu of execution methods, hired assassins to the stars. And now Bishnoi is killing politicians. Baba Siddique, local kingmaker, gunned down in the middle of Mumbai. Beyond that, things get too murky to see. According to the government of Canada, Indian intelligence is using the Bishnoi gang to murder Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. Bishnoi&#8217;s graduated into a greater game now, the game that produces the thing we call the world. </p><p>The police aren&#8217;t looking for Lawrence Bishnoi. They&#8217;ve already found him. For the last nine years, he&#8217;s directed his gang&#8217;s rise to supremacy in the Indian underworld from a cell in Sabermati Jail in Gujarat. Apparently, the authorities are powerless to stop him.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2087793,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FmQw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4473794b-37c9-4edc-8db7-25183d8ad0fe_3291x2468.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>My own criminal history is less exciting, but when I was younger, I went through a shoplifting phase. Everyone does it, I&#8217;d tell myself, waddling out of Waterstones with a book in each armpit. Everything should belong to everyone, I&#8217;d think, scurrying out the supermarket with a big wedge of purloined cheese. Emerging from H&amp;M wearing four ugly shirts at once and a pair of sunglasses stuffed in my left sock, I&#8217;d reason that if they didn&#8217;t want me to steal this stuff, they should have simply caught me before I took it. I&#8217;m not proud of myself, but to be honest I&#8217;m not really that ashamed either. I was young and broke, and then I grew up a bit and stopped. What I am ashamed of are the thoughts I started having as I dutifully poked around the Hindu temples of the north. As I mentioned last time, my Jewish upbringing made me strangely uncomfortable with all the images and icons; what I didn&#8217;t tell you was that every time I saw some faithful doddering old man leave a ten-rupee note in front of the black figure of some god, I had a sudden and intense urge to just <em>grab it</em>. What did this idol need with money? Why not me instead? Obviously it would be unthinkable to actually do it: to come to a much poorer country and nakedly steal from its people: I wanted to believe that we British were actually past that sort of thing. But in Mumbai&#8212;some of the people in this place are <em>rich</em>. </p><p>In Malabar Hill I had a good gawp at Antilia, a private skyscraper one hundred and seventy metres tall, where Mukesh Ambani and his family live among floating badminton courts and six-storey elephant stables and an aquarium extending the entire height of the building for their beloved minke whale. Outside, the police have parked an actual tank. The soldiers guarding the naval port and military headquarters all have rusty old Russian rifles, but outside Antilia the cops are twitching with nasty little Belgian and Austrian submachine guns, all lasers and silencers and spectroscopic sights, ready to perforate any prole in sight at the first sign of trouble. Later, in a nearby temple, I watched a man in a moustache and a combover plonk down a slim but respectable stack of five-hundred-rupee notes in front of the god. The statue of Agyana, seated beatifically on his antelope, didn&#8217;t seem to acknowledge the gift, and when the bald man left I didn&#8217;t even think. I made the justifications to myself later, though. This holiday isn&#8217;t cheap, and unlike my big trip last year it doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;ll pay for itself. My subscribers are a good 30% less interested in the India series than my one on China, and whose fault is that? Not <em>mine</em>. My writing is impeccable. It&#8217;s this country&#8217;s fault, for failing to fascinate Western audiences to the same degree, and aren&#8217;t I owed some compensation? It took about an hour before my bullshit started to wear thin, and I decided to give the whole stack to the first beggar I saw. But it was only as I was counting out the notes that I noticed the little slip of paper folded within. It said:</p><div class=\"preformatted-block\" data-component-name=\"PreformattedTextBlockToDOM\"><label class=\"hide-text\" contenteditable=\"false\">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label><pre class=\"text\"><em>Hello Sam\nWe see you\nWe know what you&#8217;ve done\nBe outside Building Number 35, Kherwadi, Bandra East, Mumbai 400051.

The really good stuff is behind the paywall: this time, it’s about the Upanishads of the underworld. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m once again writing from my jail cell in Mumbai, where I’ve been accused of being a footsoldier in the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, personally responsible for the recent murder of local political legend Baba Siddique. Siddique had been a councillor in the Municipal Corporation and a minister of state in the Maharashtra government; he’d sat on any number of important committees; he founded a political dynasty. He was gunned down by the Bishnoi gang outside his son’s constituency office for reasons unknown. Last time, I said I didn’t even know who Baba Siddique was until he was assassinated last month, and that’s true. Even so—and my lawyer has begged me not to write this bit, but my first duty is always to the truth—I’m not entirely innocent either. This is how I ended up here, and what happened next.\nYou have to understand what coming to Mumbai was like. For weeks, I’d been trudging around various dusty, dilapidated towns in Rajasthan, dutifully checking in on the historic palaces and the historic forts and the historic palaces inside the historic forts, half of them ruined, with bats hanging from the rafters and guano piling the floor where the tyrants of a less squalid age had once piled their gold and silks. I ate in godawful tourist restaurants with extensive menus full of burgers and fries. These people would have been horrified to discover what a burger really is, but that didn’t stop them selling any number of slimes between two buns under the name. I dodged tuktuks and human shit on narrow streets with no pavements, just a fringe of dust and heaped-up plastic, where I couldn’t walk for ten seconds without someone blocking my path—yes my friend! you want shopping? you want spend money?—proffering fake pashmina scarves or plastic idols or camel leather handbags or sometimes more ordinary things when there was nothing else to hawk, handfuls of broken masonry or bits of wood, biro caps, long ribbons of apple peel: yes my friend, you want pulp, you want chalk, you want worms? It’s a decaying world up there. Rajasthan is the most traditional, hidebound part of the country, but that doesn’t mean they’re interested in actually conserving the things they’ve received from the past, just that all they know how to do is moulder away. Brits and Israelis keep flocking to see the old forts and palaces, even if those forts are surrounded by a broad moat of filth; no need to live in anything other than comfortable squalor. Let it rot; all rot is picturesque.\nAnyway, try to imagine what it was like for me to start the day in a dusty Rajasthani town on the edge of the desert, and arrive that evening in Mumbai. To drive down the Coastal Road and just see skyscrapers, hundreds of spindles of light all along the shore of the Arabian Sea, and more of them further inland, visible in the gaps between, thousands more: a city that keeps going, glittering endlessly for miles into the haze, and all of it superdense, all crushed and glowing like a neutron star. The hypercity; South Asia’s only real metropolis. In a country of one and a half billion people, this one city produces more than a third of the total tax revenue. Delhi might be big, in a strictly demographic sense, but it feels like a hypertrophied version of a poky little town. Mumbai feels extraplanetary. It keeps on going across the bay, into the sprawling warehouses of Navi Mumbai, liquid urban stuff flooding the hinterlands of Maharashtra; it keeps going beyond our world. Across asteroids and exoplanets there are tracts of slum housing and salvage zones, chipped signs in Hindi and Marathi in the warrens where bony stunted children take apart starships for scrap, street hawkers scurrying under skies with two suns or none at all. Coming here was like being dragged facefirst across the centuries, from the ruins of the eighteenth to the furnace of the twenty-third.\nAs soon as you see the skyscrapers, Mumbai’s famous slums make perfect sense. All of India floods into this one city, and I get it. If you were a Bihari peasant farmer, scraping dust out of the dust, shitting in a communal ditch, sleeping in the same one-room hut as your goats, as your ancestors had scraped and shat and slept for five thousand years—but you knew that you lived in the same country as Mumbai, this science-fiction city bursting with money and danger, you’d have to be an idiot not to go. So they come here, to live in slums. There’s no neighbourhood in Mumbai so ritzy it doesn’t have its slums. Malabar Hill has them, swelling like boils in between the towers. This is where all the energy of the city is generated. An overflowing pool of dirt-cheap labour, flooding into the cracks. Bataille once noted that nature is in constant high tension, exploding extravagantly: cut a path through a grassy field and new plants will immediately start growing in the bare earth. But you only get this rich fecundity when every individual organism is desperately poor, on the point of starvation, gasping for space in a saturated world. Mumbai is the same. If there’s six square feet of land along a railway track, or behind the back of some luxury mall, or in the gaps between office towers, someone’s already put up a lopsided corrugated-iron shack. Or, more likely, ten of them, a hundred, crammed together, sharing zero toilets. Whole families in a room, half the size of the one they shared with the goats back home.\nBut obviously not everyone here lives like grass. The fifty thousand dollar millionaires in this city, and the millions more in the comfortable middle classes, get to prance around in the meadow. It’s easy not to see the misery here if you don’t want to: I was too entranced by how nice it felt to be in a real city again. Mumbai has pavements. It has a big monumental downtown, partially built by the British, but mostly built by the local commercial classes in a high Victorian style. Gothic clock towers, all niches and gables. Neoclassical fountains featuring allegorical sculptures of nude women with tiny European tits, to represent Industry and Thrift and Cleanliness and Sexual Repression. Mumbai has a Zara and a Uniqlo and it’s even got Pret A Manger. Supermarkets too. Not a street market, not mud-crusted plastic buckets full of fly-crawling fruit, not skinned lambs dangling from their collarbones in the street, but shelves full of hygienically packaged products, all plastic-smooth. I could have been in Tesco. In fact, I was: the Star Bazaar supermarket chain is a 50-50 joint venture between the Tata Group and Tesco plc. And maybe it was the weird familiarity of this place that made me act out.\nWhat you need to know is that Lawrence Bishnoi is currently India’s most feared gangster. He’s the man who orchestrated the murder of Baba Siddique; he’s also, according to the police, my boss. Bishnoi took the usual route into organised crime, which is to be born into the kind of respectable middle-class family that names its children after colonial-era British administrators, and then enter the underworld via the medium of student politics. While he was studying at Punjab University, Bishnoi ran for the student council and lost; next time, he realised that instead of risking another ordinary campaign, he could just threaten to kill anyone who voted the other way. He won, and was then promptly arrested. His time in jail changed his goals but not his strategy. This is how the Bishoi gang works: pure extortion. They don’t smuggle drugs, they don’t traffic women, they don’t make loans or organise illegal gambling; they just demand money and threaten to kill you if you don’t pay up. Sometimes, it’s true, they’ll kill you for other reasons. Bishnoi has vowed to kill the Bollywood actor Salman Khan over a 1998 poaching incident in which Khan shot an antelope. Lawrence Bishnoi comes from the Bishnoi panth, a caste of deeply religious tree-huggers from Rajasthan. In 1730, the Maharaja of Marwar sent soldiers to fell trees near a Bishnoi village for a new palace. Hundreds of villagers each wrapped their arms around a tree: if you want to cut this down, you’ll have to cut through me too. So they did: more than three hundred Bishnoi were sawn in half defending their trees. The Bishnoi worship all the gods, but they have a particular reverence for Agyana, god of blissful ignorance, and the antelope is his mount. Which is why, three hundred years later, Lawrence Bishnoi’s men fired a volley of gunshots at Salman Khan’s house. At least, that’s the official reason. But in the entertainment industry, nothing is what it seems. Not so long ago, everyone in Bollywood was gleefully murdering each other. Big men, famous men, shot down in the street so some actor could get out of a contract he didn’t like, or to secure international distribution rights for a frothy romance film with lots of song-and-dance numbers. And just when it looked like the bloodshed was finally winding down, the Lawrence Bishnoi gang moved into town with a laminated menu of execution methods, hired assassins to the stars. And now Bishnoi is killing politicians. Baba Siddique, local kingmaker, gunned down in the middle of Mumbai. Beyond that, things get too murky to see. According to the government of Canada, Indian intelligence is using the Bishnoi gang to murder Sikh separatists on Canadian soil. Bishnoi’s graduated into a greater game now, the game that produces the thing we call the world.\nThe police aren’t looking for Lawrence Bishnoi. They’ve already found him. For the last nine years, he’s directed his gang’s rise to supremacy in the Indian underworld from a cell in Sabermati Jail in Gujarat. Apparently, the authorities are powerless to stop him.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nMy own criminal history is less exciting, but when I was younger, I went through a shoplifting phase. Everyone does it, I’d tell myself, waddling out of Waterstones with a book in each armpit. Everything should belong to everyone, I’d think, scurrying out the supermarket with a big wedge of purloined cheese. Emerging from H&M wearing four ugly shirts at once and a pair of sunglasses stuffed in my left sock, I’d reason that if they didn’t want me to steal this stuff, they should have simply caught me before I took it. I’m not proud of myself, but to be honest I’m not really that ashamed either. I was young and broke, and then I grew up a bit and stopped. What I am ashamed of are the thoughts I started having as I dutifully poked around the Hindu temples of the north. As I mentioned last time, my Jewish upbringing made me strangely uncomfortable with all the images and icons; what I didn’t tell you was that every time I saw some faithful doddering old man leave a ten-rupee note in front of the black figure of some god, I had a sudden and intense urge to just grab it. What did this idol need with money? Why not me instead? Obviously it would be unthinkable to actually do it: to come to a much poorer country and nakedly steal from its people: I wanted to believe that we British were actually past that sort of thing. But in Mumbai—some of the people in this place are rich.\nIn Malabar Hill I had a good gawp at Antilia, a private skyscraper one hundred and seventy metres tall, where Mukesh Ambani and his family live among floating badminton courts and six-storey elephant stables and an aquarium extending the entire height of the building for their beloved minke whale. Outside, the police have parked an actual tank. The soldiers guarding the naval port and military headquarters all have rusty old Russian rifles, but outside Antilia the cops are twitching with nasty little Belgian and Austrian submachine guns, all lasers and silencers and spectroscopic sights, ready to perforate any prole in sight at the first sign of trouble. Later, in a nearby temple, I watched a man in a moustache and a combover plonk down a slim but respectable stack of five-hundred-rupee notes in front of the god. The statue of Agyana, seated beatifically on his antelope, didn’t seem to acknowledge the gift, and when the bald man left I didn’t even think. I made the justifications to myself later, though. This holiday isn’t cheap, and unlike my big trip last year it doesn’t look like it’ll pay for itself. My subscribers are a good 30% less interested in the India series than my one on China, and whose fault is that? Not mine. My writing is impeccable. It’s this country’s fault, for failing to fascinate Western audiences to the same degree, and aren’t I owed some compensation? It took about an hour before my bullshit started to wear thin, and I decided to give the whole stack to the first beggar I saw. But it was only as I was counting out the notes that I noticed the little slip of paper folded within. It said:\nText within this block will maintain its original spacing when published Hello Sam\nWe see you\nWe know what you’ve done\nBe outside Building Number 35, Kherwadi, Bandra East, Mumbai 400051. Tonight. 9 pm. Come alone.\nHE IS BEYOND KNOWLEDGE AND INCOMPREHENSION\nAfter my arrest, I tried to tell Detective Shiv Vaktashirana of the Mumbai Crime Branch what happened next.\nRead more",

In fact, before I was arrested I&#8217;d written a fair amount about Mumbai, featuring several brilliant insights. (Did you know that this city is very large? And that its people include both the extremely rich and the extremely poor?) It&#8217;ll have to wait. In the meantime, last weekend was Diwali, India&#8217;s biggest festival. Outside, I&#8217;m sure, there were diyas flickering on every windowsill, the whole endless metropolis glowing with a warm and welcoming light: from the glass windows of the skyscrapers, from the reeking holes in the slums. I&#8217;m sure the sky was bright with fireworks. I&#8217;m sure everyone danced in the streets. But where I am, the only light comes from a single fluorescent tube, and it&#8217;s been buzzing with its stark grey pallor ever since they threw me in here. No candles or dancing in my windowless cell, but I still get to hear the firecrackers. For maybe one hundred hours over the Diwali weekend there were constant firecrackers, maybe one every three seconds. As far as I can tell&#8212;although I can&#8217;t tell much from in here&#8212;people are setting off these things entirely at random. While waiting for the bus, strolling out of a restaurant, in the middle of the day, sitting in the park, fielding in a cricket game&#8212;chuck a firecracker: bang. The sound is muffled through the concrete but I can still hear every single one of them. Like gunshots. Apparently, when Baba Siddique was assassinated, he was idly throwing firecrackers on the street. The shots that killed him melted into the general din. You could hide an entire war in this city and nobody would know.</p><p>Everyone knows that Diwali is about celebrating the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. As meanings go, this is not very impressive. (A religion that upholds good over evil? Does your culture also value food and hospitality?) But if it sounds generic, that&#8217;s because it is. Officially, Diwali doesn&#8217;t actually commemorate anything in particular. In the south of India, it celebrates the time Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In Bengal, it celebrates the time Kali defeated the demon Raktabija. India, famously, has a lot of gods. But if you spend any amount of time here, it becomes clear that these days there&#8217;s only one, and the other gods have become a kind of supporting cast around him. Outside a few scattered minor cults, the god of India is Lord Ram. I&#8217;ve been to any number of Hindu temples notionally dedicated to Lakshmi or Ganesh, with a female or elephant-headed shape in the garbhagriha, but through the loudspeakers dotted around the place disembodied voices continually chant <em>Jai Shri Ram</em>. That same phrase has become a Hindu nationalist rallying cry; it&#8217;s what the mobs shout when they burn Muslim neighbourhoods. And for the majority of this country, Diwali is about Ram too: it celebrates his return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after his fourteen years of exile, in which he defeated the demon Ravana. (Defeating demons is a big deal here.) The story of Ram is deeply ingrained in this country: most people will never read the <em>Ramayana</em>, and a lot of Hindus have a very vague sense of their own religion, but this particular narrative is the scaffolding that supports the world. Ram, the hero, the perfect man. Sita, the perfect bride. Ravana, who contains every evil. Outsiders can try to study Hinduism through its vast archive of holy texts, the hoary chants of the Vedas, the philosophical Upanishads, the weird and brilliant stories of the Puranas, or maybe through yoga, meditation, spiritual communion&#8212;but the real core of it is that everyone knows the story of Ram and Sita before they can walk. This narrative is in the blood, like microplastics. Which is a shame, because once you strip away the poetry of the ancient text, the story of Ram is a very insipid fairytale.</p>\n      <p>\n          <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-5-jai-shri-tv\">\n              Read more\n          </a>\n      </p>\n   ",

As far as I can tell—although I can’t tell much from in here—people are setting off these things entirely at random. While waiting for the bus, strolling out of a restaurant, in the middle of the day, sitting in the park, fielding in a cricket game—chuck a firecracker: bang. The sound is muffled through the concrete but I can still hear every single one of them. Like gunshots. Apparently, when Baba Siddique was assassinated, he was idly throwing firecrackers on the street. The shots that killed him melted into the general din. You could hide an entire war in this city and nobody would know.\nEveryone knows that Diwali is about celebrating the victory of good over evil and light over darkness. As meanings go, this is not very impressive. (A religion that upholds good over evil? Does your culture also value food and hospitality?) But if it sounds generic, that’s because it is. Officially, Diwali doesn’t actually commemorate anything in particular. In the south of India, it celebrates the time Krishna defeated the demon Narakasura. In Bengal, it celebrates the time Kali defeated the demon Raktabija. India, famously, has a lot of gods. But if you spend any amount of time here, it becomes clear that these days there’s only one, and the other gods have become a kind of supporting cast around him. Outside a few scattered minor cults, the god of India is Lord Ram. I’ve been to any number of Hindu temples notionally dedicated to Lakshmi or Ganesh, with a female or elephant-headed shape in the garbhagriha, but through the loudspeakers dotted around the place disembodied voices continually chant Jai Shri Ram. That same phrase has become a Hindu nationalist rallying cry; it’s what the mobs shout when they burn Muslim neighbourhoods. And for the majority of this country, Diwali is about Ram too: it celebrates his return to the kingdom of Ayodhya after his fourteen years of exile, in which he defeated the demon Ravana. (Defeating demons is a big deal here.) The story of Ram is deeply ingrained in this country: most people will never read the Ramayana, and a lot of Hindus have a very vague sense of their own religion, but this particular narrative is the scaffolding that supports the world. Ram, the hero, the perfect man. Sita, the perfect bride. Ravana, who contains every evil. Outsiders can try to study Hinduism through its vast archive of holy texts, the hoary chants of the Vedas, the philosophical Upanishads, the weird and brilliant stories of the Puranas, or maybe through yoga, meditation, spiritual communion—but the real core of it is that everyone knows the story of Ram and Sita before they can walk. This narrative is in the blood, like microplastics. Which is a shame, because once you strip away the poetry of the ancient text, the story of Ram is a very insipid fairytale.\nRead more",

As everyone knows, one of them contains all the smart people, the academics, the professionals, the people who&#8217;ve read the studies, learned the science, educated themselves, who eat well and own nice things made of wood, the good little boys and girls who know what&#8217;s best for everyone. It&#8217;s not polite to say this about the other side, but everyone is secretly aware that they are&#8212;let&#8217;s be honest here&#8212;morons. Actual imbeciles, breathing through the spittle in their mouths. Glassy-eyed religious maniacs. Frothing adult virgins with their heads full of Y-DNA charts and built-up cum. Uncomfortably globular men who have unknowingly outsourced their entire sense of reality to Kenyan scammers generating engagement-bait with ChatGPT. If you talk to these people for even a few minutes, it becomes clear there&#8217;s something very seriously wrong with them. Instead of articulate speech, they produce a constant stream of meaningless drivel, mashed-up waste syllables, usually referring to some podcaster, political nobody, or minor advertising campaign that no one whose life is worth living has ever heard of. A good chunk of them have reverted to a magical, Stone Age account of the universe, in which everything that happens, including ordinary weather events, is part of a Plan set in motion by Them, to distract you. Distract you from what? It&#8217;s not clear, but the idiot&#8217;s eyes are constantly shifting around from object to object and screen to screen, darting with the terror of a primitive in a defensive crouch against a world he simply doesn&#8217;t have the faculties to understand. Because this faction is so stupid and offputting, its political party is deeply unpopular. In fact, it&#8217;s only won the popular vote in a Presidential election two times since 1988. The first time was in 2004, when the entire country was in the middle of a psychotic war fever, ravenous for blood, crazy in a way that&#8217;s difficult to imagine now. The Disney channel used to broadcast little idents of teen celebs, gushing about how much they loved the American flag. The other time they won was the other day. It wasn&#8217;t even close. Somehow, the imbeciles outsmarted the smartest people in the world. And I said this would happen. Not to gloat, but: I told you so. I told you so. I told you so. </p><p>Look:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg\" width=\"800\" height=\"769\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:769,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:156279,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tuDM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd00a2d14-ae61-4d82-894d-db570eaa1315_800x769.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>One of my most foundational political beliefs is that while the winner in an election doesn&#8217;t usually deserve to win, the loser always deserves to lose. I can&#8217;t think of anyone who deserved to lose more than Kamala Harris.</p><p>According to the Democratic Party, the election they just lost in a humiliating landslide was the most important election in anyone&#8217;s lifetime, a last-ditch effort to protect democracy itself from Trump&#8217;s incipient authoritarianism. Out of the entire population, they could only choose one person to be their champion, to go head-to-head against Donald Trump and stop his new fascist cacocracy from becoming reality. The lives and welfare of millions&#8212;billions!&#8212;depended on their making the right choice. And who did they pick? One of the least popular politicians in the country, the goofy cackling woman who says things like &#8216;It is time to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day,&#8217; who seems mildly but permanently xanned, who moves through the world like a pat of half-melted butter. For the Democrats to lose one election to Donald Trump by nominating an obviously terrible candidate is an honest mistake. Two, and something&#8217;s up. The question isn&#8217;t why Harris lost to Trump&#8212;why was she ever in a position to lose to him in the first place?</p><p class=\"button-wrapper\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}\" data-component-name=\"ButtonCreateButton\"><a class=\"button primary\" href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?\"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>Kamala Harris is not an untalented politician. In fact, she&#8217;s a very good one, but unfortunately that&#8217;s all she&#8217;s good at. Her parents do seem like genuinely interesting people. Donald Harris is a Jamaican development economist and one of only a handful of people to have received his country&#8217;s Order of Merit; the others include Bob Marley, Derek Walcott, and Fidel Castro. Shyamala Gopalan Harris was a Tam-Brahm from Madras who moved to America to research the genetics of breast cancer. Not exactly the kind of hardscrabble immigrant background that plays well in America, but it&#8217;s not boring either. The couple met through the Black Panthers. Cool! But maybe coming to America was a mistake, because in America everything is tinsel-thin, and in America even students of the historical dialectic can produce a daughter who goes around giving unrequited commencement speeches on what can be, unburdened by what has been. Kamala was not good at school, not particularly talented at university, and when she defaulted to law school she wasn&#8217;t particularly stellar there either. But at Howard she was pouting around with the girls at Alpha Kappa Alpha, which was apparently the swaggiest, brown-paper-baggiest sorority on campus, and at Hastings Law School she was the head of the Black Law Students Association. She was good at the game, making connections, leveraging them, getting ahead. After law school she spent a few years dating California political legend Willie Brown, and while it might not be fair to say that&#8217;s the only explanation for her political success, he can&#8217;t exactly have hurt. She got herself into enough of the right circles to jump from District Attorney to Attorney General to the Senate. Her world kept getting bigger; by 2003 she was calling Willie Brown &#8216;the albatross hanging around my neck.&#8217; By all accounts, she&#8217;s a charismatic schmoozer, but deeply tyrannical to anyone unlucky enough to find themselves among her underlings. In 2020 she ran for President. She can&#8217;t have possibly thought she would win. It was Joe Biden&#8217;s year, the result was already written, and she was a two-year Senator with no actual achievements to her name. But it was a smart move: raise her profile, make her talents known, and after dropping out she could leverage her way into some kind of juicy post. Keep on climbing. She&#8217;s a very good politician.</p><p>The one thing missing from this story, though, is the electorate. Kamala Harris isn&#8217;t good with electorates. She&#8217;s a machine politician. She wants power, but not for any particular reason. It&#8217;s just that life is a game, and the point is to reach the highest level. Sidle your way into a series of darker and smokier rooms. When she ran for Attorney General in 2010 she secured endorsements from Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but in the end she beat her Republican opponent by less than one percentage point&#8212;in <em>California</em>, which hasn&#8217;t elected a Republican AG in thirty years. When she dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary, it was still 2019. She was polling as close to 0% as makes no difference, and had not actually contested a single state. But why bother? For politicians like Harris, the people are just another annoying hurdle on the road to success. And she was right. History intervened. Nobody knew it at the time, but it turned out that the 2020 election was held in the fateful year of 2020, which meant that Biden was essentially obliged to pick a black woman as his running mate. (A lot of people seem to remember him explicitly promising to do so, which he didn&#8217;t; he promised to put a black woman&#8212;any black woman, apparently&#8212;on the Supreme Court. This sort of thing was normal at the time.) Of all the black women available, Harris was the obvious choice. She wouldn&#8217;t make trouble. She knew how to play the game. She was a well-functioning part of a well-functioning machine.</p><p>The reason Kamala Harris lost is the same as the reason she was the candidate to begin with: the Democratic Party is allergic to democracy. It&#8217;s the instrument of a particular form of class power; its role is basically disciplinary. When it comes to an actual crisis, all it knows how to do is coil in on itself, breathe in its own fumes, suck itself off until completion. The party knew that Joe Biden&#8217;s brains kept running out of his nose and into his morning coffee, but they kept pretending until it was far too late that he was running laps around the White House lawn and solving new problems in theoretical physics in his spare time. They really seemed to think that people wouldn&#8217;t notice what was right in front of them. Maybe they simply didn&#8217;t care. When people <em>did</em> notice, when Biden stretched his arm too wide at the first debate and all the stuffing came out, the party made sure his overthrow and replacement went as smoothly and as seamlessly as possible. No messy primaries, no ideological bickering, just a slick, stage-managed show. They&#8217;re very good at politics too.</p><p>Do you remember Brat Summer? I remember Brat Summer. It was genuinely amazing, one of the most bizarre mass psychological phenomena I&#8217;ve ever seen. Before a clock spring popped out of Joe Biden&#8217;s forehead on live TV, Kamala Harris was the least popular Vice President in recent US history. There were a lot of reasons for this, but I think the big ones are these. Firstly, she was already deeply unpopular&#8212;0% polls, remember&#8212;before she became VP. Secondly, she&#8217;d done absolutely nothing with the position except emit strange and incomprehensible bromides whenever she opened her mouth. But as soon as she became the candidate, despite nothing about her actually changing, her approval rating skyrocketed. It turns out that all you have to do is tell the Democratic base that they ought to like someone, and they&#8217;ll just start liking her. I think this is evidence of an extraordinary generosity of spirit. All of us, and me especially, could learn something from them. But it was incredible to watch. All these pols and pundits, who had been so stiff and serious in the gloom of the Biden era, suddenly breaking out in virulent lime green. Like a new tropical disease ripping through the establishment. Doughy old columnists transformed overnight into thirteen-year-old girls in shiny lipgloss. <em>Ew. You&#8217;re, like, totally weird.</em> Somehow this career politician, born when parts of Africa still belonged to the British Empire, turned overnight into some kind of snotty egirl. The <em>New York Times</em> printed the words &#8216;coconut-pilled,&#8217; along with an op-ed about how she embodied the principle of &#8216;black joy.&#8217; Sure, it was all vibes, but the vibes were good. In Gaza, they were lining up dozens of people in the courtyards of hospitals and crushing them to death with bulldozers, but that was all very far away.

      "script_text": "Image: Unable to generate caption\n\nThere are two factions in American politics, and they’re not evenly matched. As everyone knows, one of them contains all the smart people, the academics, the professionals, the people who’ve read the studies, learned the science, educated themselves, who eat well and own nice things made of wood, the good little boys and girls who know what’s best for everyone. It’s not polite to say this about the other side, but everyone is secretly aware that they are—let’s be honest here—morons. Actual imbeciles, breathing through the spittle in their mouths. Glassy-eyed religious maniacs. Frothing adult virgins with their heads full of Y-DNA charts and built-up cum. Uncomfortably globular men who have unknowingly outsourced their entire sense of reality to Kenyan scammers generating engagement-bait with ChatGPT. If you talk to these people for even a few minutes, it becomes clear there’s something very seriously wrong with them. Instead of articulate speech, they produce a constant stream of meaningless drivel, mashed-up waste syllables, usually referring to some podcaster, political nobody, or minor advertising campaign that no one whose life is worth living has ever heard of. A good chunk of them have reverted to a magical, Stone Age account of the universe, in which everything that happens, including ordinary weather events, is part of a Plan set in motion by Them, to distract you. Distract you from what? It’s not clear, but the idiot’s eyes are constantly shifting around from object to object and screen to screen, darting with the terror of a primitive in a defensive crouch against a world he simply doesn’t have the faculties to understand. Because this faction is so stupid and offputting, its political party is deeply unpopular. In fact, it’s only won the popular vote in a Presidential election two times since 1988. The first time was in 2004, when the entire country was in the middle of a psychotic war fever, ravenous for blood, crazy in a way that’s difficult to imagine now. The Disney channel used to broadcast little idents of teen celebs, gushing about how much they loved the American flag. The other time they won was the other day. It wasn’t even close. Somehow, the imbeciles outsmarted the smartest people in the world. And I said this would happen. Not to gloat, but: I told you so. I told you so. I told you so.\nLook:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOne of my most foundational political beliefs is that while the winner in an election doesn’t usually deserve to win, the loser always deserves to lose. I can’t think of anyone who deserved to lose more than Kamala Harris.\nAccording to the Democratic Party, the election they just lost in a humiliating landslide was the most important election in anyone’s lifetime, a last-ditch effort to protect democracy itself from Trump’s incipient authoritarianism. Out of the entire population, they could only choose one person to be their champion, to go head-to-head against Donald Trump and stop his new fascist cacocracy from becoming reality. The lives and welfare of millions—billions!—depended on their making the right choice. And who did they pick? One of the least popular politicians in the country, the goofy cackling woman who says things like ‘It is time to do what we have been doing, and that time is every day,’ who seems mildly but permanently xanned, who moves through the world like a pat of half-melted butter. For the Democrats to lose one election to Donald Trump by nominating an obviously terrible candidate is an honest mistake. Two, and something’s up. The question isn’t why Harris lost to Trump—why was she ever in a position to lose to him in the first place?\nSubscribe now\nKamala Harris is not an untalented politician. In fact, she’s a very good one, but unfortunately that’s all she’s good at. Her parents do seem like genuinely interesting people. Donald Harris is a Jamaican development economist and one of only a handful of people to have received his country’s Order of Merit; the others include Bob Marley, Derek Walcott, and Fidel Castro. Shyamala Gopalan Harris was a Tam-Brahm from Madras who moved to America to research the genetics of breast cancer. Not exactly the kind of hardscrabble immigrant background that plays well in America, but it’s not boring either. The couple met through the Black Panthers. Cool! But maybe coming to America was a mistake, because in America everything is tinsel-thin, and in America even students of the historical dialectic can produce a daughter who goes around giving unrequited commencement speeches on what can be, unburdened by what has been. Kamala was not good at school, not particularly talented at university, and when she defaulted to law school she wasn’t particularly stellar there either. But at Howard she was pouting around with the girls at Alpha Kappa Alpha, which was apparently the swaggiest, brown-paper-baggiest sorority on campus, and at Hastings Law School she was the head of the Black Law Students Association. She was good at the game, making connections, leveraging them, getting ahead. After law school she spent a few years dating California political legend Willie Brown, and while it might not be fair to say that’s the only explanation for her political success, he can’t exactly have hurt. She got herself into enough of the right circles to jump from District Attorney to Attorney General to the Senate. Her world kept getting bigger; by 2003 she was calling Willie Brown ‘the albatross hanging around my neck.’ By all accounts, she’s a charismatic schmoozer, but deeply tyrannical to anyone unlucky enough to find themselves among her underlings. In 2020 she ran for President. She can’t have possibly thought she would win. It was Joe Biden’s year, the result was already written, and she was a two-year Senator with no actual achievements to her name. But it was a smart move: raise her profile, make her talents known, and after dropping out she could leverage her way into some kind of juicy post. Keep on climbing. She’s a very good politician.\nThe one thing missing from this story, though, is the electorate. Kamala Harris isn’t good with electorates. She’s a machine politician. She wants power, but not for any particular reason. It’s just that life is a game, and the point is to reach the highest level. Sidle your way into a series of darker and smokier rooms. When she ran for Attorney General in 2010 she secured endorsements from Diane Feinstein and Nancy Pelosi, but in the end she beat her Republican opponent by less than one percentage point—in California, which hasn’t elected a Republican AG in thirty years. When she dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primary, it was still 2019. She was polling as close to 0% as makes no difference, and had not actually contested a single state. But why bother? For politicians like Harris, the people are just another annoying hurdle on the road to success. And she was right. History intervened. Nobody knew it at the time, but it turned out that the 2020 election was held in the fateful year of 2020, which meant that Biden was essentially obliged to pick a black woman as his running mate. (A lot of people seem to remember him explicitly promising to do so, which he didn’t; he promised to put a black woman—any black woman, apparently—on the Supreme Court. This sort of thing was normal at the time.) Of all the black women available, Harris was the obvious choice. She wouldn’t make trouble. She knew how to play the game. She was a well-functioning part of a well-functioning machine.\nThe reason Kamala Harris lost is the same as the reason she was the candidate to begin with: the Democratic Party is allergic to democracy. It’s the instrument of a particular form of class power; its role is basically disciplinary. When it comes to an actual crisis, all it knows how to do is coil in on itself, breathe in its own fumes, suck itself off until completion. The party knew that Joe Biden’s brains kept running out of his nose and into his morning coffee, but they kept pretending until it was far too late that he was running laps around the White House lawn and solving new problems in theoretical physics in his spare time. They really seemed to think that people wouldn’t notice what was right in front of them. Maybe they simply didn’t care. When people did notice, when Biden stretched his arm too wide at the first debate and all the stuffing came out, the party made sure his overthrow and replacement went as smoothly and as seamlessly as possible. No messy primaries, no ideological bickering, just a slick, stage-managed show. They’re very good at politics too.\nDo you remember Brat Summer? I remember Brat Summer. It was genuinely amazing, one of the most bizarre mass psychological phenomena I’ve ever seen. Before a clock spring popped out of Joe Biden’s forehead on live TV, Kamala Harris was the least popular Vice President in recent US history. There were a lot of reasons for this, but I think the big ones are these. Firstly, she was already deeply unpopular—0% polls, remember—before she became VP. Secondly, she’d done absolutely nothing with the position except emit strange and incomprehensible bromides whenever she opened her mouth. But as soon as she became the candidate, despite nothing about her actually changing, her approval rating skyrocketed. It turns out that all you have to do is tell the Democratic base that they ought to like someone, and they’ll just start liking her. I think this is evidence of an extraordinary generosity of spirit. All of us, and me especially, could learn something from them. But it was incredible to watch. All these pols and pundits, who had been so stiff and serious in the gloom of the Biden era, suddenly breaking out in virulent lime green. Like a new tropical disease ripping through the establishment. Doughy old columnists transformed overnight into thirteen-year-old girls in shiny lipgloss. Ew. You’re, like, totally weird. Somehow this career politician, born when parts of Africa still belonged to the British Empire, turned overnight into some kind of snotty egirl. The New York Times printed the words ‘coconut-pilled,’ along with an op-ed about how she embodied the principle of ‘black joy.’ Sure, it was all vibes, but the vibes were good. In Gaza, they were lining up dozens of people in the courtyards of hospitals and crushing them to death with bulldozers, but that was all very far away. Wasn’t it fun, now that Old Man Biden was gone and you could play with your brand-new Kamala doll as much as you like? But for some unaccountable reason, among the general public, ‘Kamala: You Already Like Her!’ was not the brilliant pitch it seemed to be.\nHard to blame her, though; it’s not like she had many other choices. She became Vice President in a cultural atmosphere in which her historic status as a black woman was a potential vote-winner, in which you could bludgeon people into supporting you—or, at least, not opposing you—by suggesting that they’re bigots if they don’t play along. A lot can change in four years. Bigotry is actually kinda in right now. Another option would be to actually offer something to the voters. Some prospect that she could maybe make their lives better. That’s what Trump did: he offered an enemy to blame and the prospect of doing violence to them. Not a bad deal.

You have to give them your love and respect and admiration and, crucially, your vote. Otherwise the monster wins.\nWhich is the line they reverted to, once Brat Summer faded. Blackmail: democracy is on the ballot. Project 2025. The Republican plot to steal your pronouns. Fascism on the horizon. All of which might be real: Donald Trump exists within the purely instinctive life, a kind of wafting meditative state in which everything is possible. He can levitate a few inches off the ground; he is capable of extreme evil. Last time, he tried to overturn the result of a democratic election, which is very bad juju.

This city was founded in 1156 by the Bhati, a Rajput clan pushed into the desert from their Afghan heartland by waves of invaders from the steppe. According to Orlando, for the people of Jaisalmer not much has changed since. Don&#8217;t be fooled by their clothes, he told me. Don&#8217;t be fooled by the fact that they&#8217;ve all got iPhones. Out here, the veneer of modernity gets real thin. This is a closed society. Inside their heads&#8212;and here he tapped against the side of his own head&#8212;it&#8217;s still 1156.</p><p>I met Orlando in a tiny bookshop-caf&#233; tangled up somewhere in Jaisalmer&#8217;s knot of alleys. This is a weird place. A lot of the streets here don&#8217;t have names: even on Google a bunch of addresses simply consist of &#8216;near the Lakshmi temple&#8217; or &#8216;near the eastern wall.&#8217; The postman knows where it is. But it meant I only got one conversation with Orlando, because when I tried to find that bookshop-caf&#233; again, it was unreachable. I just kept turning one corner after another onto a succession of charming alleyways lined with ornate overhanging balconies, all baking and silent in the forty-degree afternoon, none of which contained my destination. I was circling the little red pin on my maps app, sometimes coming extremely close, sometimes landing on top of it, but somehow the actual place was nowhere to be seen. It had absconded from Euclidean space. It was accessible only via some special alley, running at an angle slightly against the grain of the rest of the physical universe. But I remember the place. The bookshop sold what every bookshop in every tourist destination in India sells: the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>, <em>Shantaram</em>, and <em>Atomic Habits</em>. They also did a decent stuffed paratha, and a little notice explained that if you dobbed him a few hundred rupees the owner would drive you out to his village in the desert and introduce you to his mum. There was also a Polaroid of the owner and Orlando posted up near the entrance, although I didn&#8217;t really notice it until after I&#8217;d met the man himself. Maybe <em>met</em> is the wrong word. What happened is that while I was midway through my paratha, Orlando entered and started talking to me. He continued for maybe two hours, at which point I said that I probably ought to get going. About half an hour later, I actually left. Maybe that was rude of me, leaving. Maybe that&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t been allowed to return. </p><p>There are two types of people who will just <em>talk at you</em> like this, going through their entire life story without ever stopping to ask you a perfunctory question about yourself. Old people do it, and Americans do it too. Orlando was both. Fortunately, his life story was interesting. He came into the caf&#233; plump, pale, and sweating; smartly dressed, with his linen shirt neatly tucked into his cargo pants, but a big crunchy bucket hat on his head. He never told me exactly where he was from, just that he had quit the United States and had no intention of ever, ever going back. He lived in H&#7897;i An now, in a medium-sized apartment that he showed me through the many, many pictures on his phone. Here&#8217;s the bedroom. Here&#8217;s the bathroom. They both had the exact same white marble tiles on the floor. Isn&#8217;t it beautiful? he kept saying. He said that the American Dream was no longer possible in America; you had to go to Vietnam. He showed me a picture of his fridge-freezer. That&#8217;s it, he said, wide freezer, there&#8217;s a grocery store on the ground floor of my building, I don&#8217;t even have to go outside: that&#8217;s the American Dream. But he&#8217;d only recently discovered that the spirit of liberty is still alive on the Thu B&#7891;n Delta: before that, he&#8217;d spent five years living in Jaisalmer. It hadn&#8217;t worked out. There had been some catastrophe, some nameless bad thing had happened, and the people of this tiny hairball of a city had forced him to leave. But even if he couldn&#8217;t live here, he still kept coming back, for a month at a time, to check in on his old friends. Or to let his enemies know that they still hadn&#8217;t won.</p><p>I had to piece together Orlando&#8217;s story from the various little crumbs he dropped here and there in his long ramble, but I&#8217;ll give it to you in chronological order. Orlando had only recently retired from his job somewhere in the blandness of America when he got some very bad medical news. He responded by buying a plane ticket. Over the months that followed the medical news got worse and worse and his tickets got more and more expensive, until eventually it got so bad that he bought a one way flight. His wife didn&#8217;t approve. She still had a life. Whatever it was Orlando was doing, she&#8217;d had enough; she wanted him to come home. So that was it: after forty-eight years together, after everything they&#8217;d been through in that time, he divorced her. </p><p>Orlando drifted weightless around the world until he finally came to rest in Jaisalmer. He loved it here, this squiggle of old, old streets almost chiselled out of the rock. And he was welcomed, at first. Jaisalmer runs on the tourist industry, now there are no more camel caravans crossing the Thar Desert. According to Booking.com, this is one of the ten most welcoming cities on the planet. But the people of Jaisalmer expect their visitors to come, have various wonderful experiences, buy lots of tat, and then, crucially, leave. Orlando wouldn&#8217;t leave. He rented a room from an ancient, impoverished Brahmin woman inside the fort and started trying to worm his way into the actual life of the city. Accompanying his landlady to funerals. Eating meals with her. This made people antsy. Jaisalmer, Orlando kept telling me, is a closed society. Anyone with money can stay in its hotels, but only Brahmins and Rajputs are allowed to actually live inside the fort. Orlando was crossing a line. Eventually people started asking him what it was he did for a living. They weren&#8217;t making small talk: they were trying to place him in the caste system. They were trying to work out what sort of creature he was. But Orlando is an American: he comes from the shapeless world. I don&#8217;t do anything for a living, he told them, I just exist. Only one of his new neighbours was smart enough to ask: so, what did you do <em>before</em> you did nothing? Orlando fobbed him off too. Eventually, the head of the local Brahmin clan took him in for an interrogation. When you die, the Brahmin asked him, do you want to die in America or in India? Orlando told him that he was never going back to America. He lived in India now, and he wanted to die here too. The Brahmin wasn&#8217;t finished. When you die, he said, do you want to be buried or burned? Orlando pretended to think about it. I reckon burned, he decided. And when you&#8217;re burned, the Brahmin said, do you want the ashes to go in the ground or in the water? Orlando mulled this one over for a while. You know, he said, I&#8217;d never really thought about it, but my gut is telling me the ashes should go in the water. And that was it. The clan accepted him. He could stay.</p><p>But it&#8217;s dangerous, telling an American that the clan accepts him. Every single American goes through life nurturing the secret hope that some clan of brightly-dressed indigenes will some day realise that he has the spirit of the coyote, just like them, and adopt him into the tribe. It&#8217;s part of that colonial complex they have. Sooner or later, your American will get weird and start pushing boundaries. Orlando started pushing boundaries in very short order. All of this had happened in late 2019; a few months later, suddenly everyone in the world was confined to their homes and Jaisalmer&#8217;s tourist trade dried up overnight. For a town that produces nothing except beauty, this was very bad news. Orlando holed up in his landlady&#8217;s empty apartment, just the two of them in the dark, in a city gone silent. Everyone was suffering, pawning their gold jewellery to make it through the year, but unlike all his fellow clan members Orlando had a big fat American 401(k), and far away in New York the stock market was booming. A good chunk of it ended up in his landlady&#8217;s pockets. She was very grateful. She thanked him the only way she could: by performing puja to him, tying a rakhi around his wrist, and declaring him to be her brother. This, Orlando told me, was a big deal. Brother-sister relationships are not taken lightly in Hinduism. It might have been less serious if he and the landlady had just had sex. </p><p>Orlando&#8217;s version of events is that her clan were upset at being upstaged: that he&#8217;d stepped in to help this old woman when none of her actual family would. Shame becomes anger. And that might well have been part of it. But try to see things from their perspective. You make your accommodations with the tourist trade, but if you&#8217;re a very traditional Hindu&#8212;and a lot of people in Jaisalmer are&#8212;then all foreigners are technically outcastes, mleccha, impure, untouchable. Technically, Orlando and I and all the other rich Westerners who descend on this town to take photos and spend money occupy the same caste position as the shit-haulers and carrion-eaters, the people too impure to live in the village, who have to bed down with pigs in the filth-heaps outside. No one&#8217;s so strict now, obviously. You make your accommodations. Break bread with the rich outcastes, dress them up in colourful turbans, and always, always smile. You&#8217;ll even accept this one funny mleccha as an honorary member of the clan, a kind of animal mascot, like the goat that&#8217;s a sergeant in the Indian Army. But if he&#8217;s a <em>brother</em>, that means you have actual kinship relations with this creature. Suddenly it&#8217;s not a game any more. Word got to Orlando that he was no longer safe in Jaisalmer, and if he knew what was good for him he&#8217;d get out. So he did, in a hurry. He wiped his hard drive, carried his clothes and gadgets out of the fort, and gave them to a Muslim family with instructions to donate it all to the poor. Straight to the airport from there. Off to Vietnam, where the Communist Party is in power and the American Dream is alive: a normal, modern society where the world is nice and shapeless and anyone can rent an apartment from anyone else.</p><p>When I left, there were sonic booms overhead. Jaisalmer might be a medieval town with a medieval mindset, but it&#8217;s also a frontier town now: its isolated spot in the middle of the desert puts it right near the border with Pakistan. On the streets below, Brahmin clans protect the old ways in their half-rotten homes.

Back in <a href=\"https://samkriss.substack.com/p/numb-in-india-part-2-the-city-beautiful\">part two</a> I talked about learning the terrible secret of the Sun in Sawai Jai Singh&#8217;s city of Jaipur, but I didn&#8217;t mention that while I was there, entirely by chance, I ran into my friend Meagan Day, who you might know from her <a href=\"https://jacobin.com/author/meagan-day\">excellent labour reportage</a> for <em>Jacobin</em>. Meagan was in India for the annual conference of the Global Labour University, which was held this year at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. At JNU the walls were painted with the words <em>Workers of the world, unite!</em> in English, Hindi, and Malayalam, and there were talks from union organisers who&#8217;d been through truly terrible things in countries where they break strikes with clubs and guns. After the conference was over, she had a couple of days free, so she went to Jaipur to see some forts and palaces and gold and jewels. A few days for the proletariat, a few days for the aristocracy. </p><p>It was fun: we were ushered through various gaudily decorated rooms of state by a mandatory tour guide who kept pointing out the best spots for selfies; later we were menaced by the monkeys at the monkey temple. But during her time in Delhi, Meagan had managed to pick up on some of what&#8217;s happening on the Indian student left. What&#8217;s happening is this: a lot of people involved happen to be Brahmins, and every six months someone notices this fact, at which point everyone starts violently melting down over casteism and caste politics, and then as soon as the situation stabilises it happens again. Most recently, some academics released a statement supporting hunger-striking students, in which they repeated a few of the students&#8217; demands: a caste census, new student faculty elections, more sensitivity trainings, etc. The hunger strikers fid not take kindly to that &#8216;etc.&#8217; Posters on the &#8216;etc-ification&#8217; of oppressed-caste issues started appearing all over campus. &#8216;It&#8217;s not just about the grammar of the English language; it&#8217;s actually about the grammar of <em>Brahminical politics</em>.&#8217;</p><p>According to Raja, our guide in Jaipur, caste no longer matters in India. He came from the Verma caste, traditionally goldsmiths. And he had been an artist; his works had been exhibited in Germany and the Czech Republic. As it happened, his daughter had just started art school herself, studying textiles. But Raja insisted that this had nothing to do with being Verma. The Verma honour a particular deity called Bhairava, or The Fearsome One, a black, gnashing, sword-wielding, dog-riding emanation of Shiva who once cut off one of the heads of Brahma during an argument. As a Verma, Raja would occasionally sacrifice goats to Bhairava, but his profile picture on WhatsApp showed his actual favourite god: sweet, horny, flute-playing Krishna, all big eyes and pink pouty lips. Raja said he had friends from every caste: he ate with them, he drank with them, and if his daughter wanted to marry a non-Verma of course he wouldn&#8217;t care one bit. All of that is gone now, he said. Maybe in the countryside it still matters, but not here. But it clearly matters in Jaisalmer, and it also seemed to matter quite a lot to the Bahujan student activists at JNU. Their convolutions seemed familiar. Meagan and I are both fairly old-fashioned, class-oriented leftists, and for a while in the long 2010s that meant you were drafted into a very silly ideological struggle between class and some nebulous thing called <em>identity</em>. As far as we could tell, something similar is happening in India: caste joins race and gender and sexuality in the big bundle of axes of oppression. But caste is also <em>material</em>: it all has to do with the work you do. It looks like class; it <em>feels</em> like something else. Everyone knows that there&#8217;s a caste system in India, but the more you learn about it the murkier things get. What exactly is this thing? Where does it come from? What does it do?</p><p>I think I&#8217;ve found an answer. But it&#8217;s not what you think. In fact, almost everything you think you know about the caste system is probably wrong. Most Westerners are aware that there are four castes, which are the Brahmins, the priests and scholars, at the top, followed by Kshatriyas, kings and warriors, then Vaishyas, traders and artisans, and finally Shudras, peasants and servants, with the Dalits or untouchables in a kind of conceptual refuse ground beneath the entire system. This fourfold system is called varna, and simple and easy to remember, but it barely exists and hasn&#8217;t really functioned for a very long time. The actual Kshatriya lineages are all long extinct, and there are hardly any Vaishyas either; even most relatively high-caste people are from Shudra stock. Varna is also hardly unique to India; essentially the same system organised the estates of the anciens r&#233;gimes in Europe. The actual castes aren&#8217;t the varnas, but the jatis. </p><p>What is a jati? Mervyn Peake&#8217;s Gormenghast included a hereditary clan of &#8216;Grey Scrubbers&#8217; whose entire lives are spent cleaning the castle kitchens. &#8216;It had been their privilege on reaching adolescence to discover that, being the sons of their fathers, their careers had been arranged for them. Through daily proximity to the great slabs of stone, the faces of the Grey Scrubbers had become like slabs themselves. The eyes were there, small and flat as coins, and the colour of the walls themselves, as though during the long hours of professional staring the grey stone had at last reflected itself indelibly once and for all.&#8217; That&#8217;s a jati. Imagine if every air-traffic controller had to come from one of the secretive families of air-traffic controllers implanted in every city, and instead of passing an exam they simply perform their mysterious rites before a tiny black idol of God in his form as a cosmic air-traffic controller, directing the movements of stars and galaxies from his terminal in the great control tower beyond the physical universe, and then the airports have to hire them. Now imagine the air-traffic controllers all refuse to eat in the presence of pilots, who are their social inferiors, and if the daughter of an air-traffic controller tries to marry a pilot, her parents might try to kill her. Also, one person can &#8216;be&#8217; a pilot and another an air traffic controller, even though neither of them have been anywhere near an airport and they&#8217;re actually both just millet farmers. That&#8217;s a jati. There&#8217;s no single list of every jati in India, and according to a lot of experts such a list would be impossible, but depending on how you draw your definitions there are anywhere from 3,000 to 25,000 distinct endogamous castes. Water-carriers, barbers, spinners, dung-collectors, cannibals. And every few miles, the entire system shifts, and there&#8217;s a new and intricate balance of different castes, each with its own job to perform, its own internal laws, its own customs, and its own gods.</p><p>For slightly more clued-in Western observers, there have been two main approaches to the caste system. The first has been to see it as an expression of political and economic power relations. This approach is not always Marxist. Early European missionaries in India soon found that if they preached to the lower castes, the Brahmins would refuse to have anything to do with them, so the Jesuits started dividing themselves into castes and maintaining strict separation. Afterwards, they were accused of adopting heathen superstitions. (This happened to the Jesuits a lot, possibly because they kept adopting heathen superstitions. At the same time, over in China, they were happily taking part in Confucian sacrifices.) The missionaries replied that caste was a purely social distinction, not a religious one. For a long time, it was assumed by British administrators that the entire caste system had been invented by the Brahmins to entrench their social power. By Marx&#8217;s day, a few observers were starting to question this idea, but he was, unsurprisingly, on the side of caste as an expression of social divisions. In <em>The German Ideology</em>, he scoffs: &#8216;When the crude form of the division of labour which is to be found among the Indians calls forth the caste-system in their state and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form.&#8217; </p><p>I am still some kind of Marxist, so I am eventually going to conclude that caste is an expression of the division of labour. But I&#8217;m a bad Marxist, so we&#8217;re going to get there the long way, through the other approach, the one that involves ideas and ideologies and the thunder of animal-headed gods, rather than simple political and economic facts. And the division of labour we end up with might not be the one you&#8217;re used to.</p><p>Probably the best representative of the other side is Louis Dumont&#8217;s 1966 opus <em>Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications</em>. It&#8217;s an exhaustive study of caste as an ideology, and I&#8217;ve been lugging all five hundred and fifty pages around this vast country. In a moment we can consider whether Homo Hierarchicus is a good or useful book; the most important thing to know about it, though, is that it contains some really beautiful and incomprehensible French-structuralist diagrams, like this:</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg\" width=\"652\" height=\"936\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:652,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:530156,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!05yW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11b12c14-d529-4ffe-b4a8-81a7f9becd0a_652x936.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Dumont&#8217;s aim is to examine the caste system from the inside: instead of starting with big historical theories, he wants to reconstruct what it&#8217;s like to see the world through the eyes of someone deeply embedded in the world of caste. This is a difficult job. Europeans instinctively see society as a collection of basically autonomous individuals who have decided to come together for mutual gain. Indians are simply not the same. For Indians, any individual human being is just a piece of a rigid, all-encompassing hierarchy. And <em>hierarchy</em> is what Dumont identifies as the main principle of the caste system. Hierarchy looks a lot like ordinary power, but Dumont insists it&#8217;s something entirely different. There&#8217;s a division of labour, but &#8216;it eludes what we call economics because it is founded on an implicit reference to the whole, which, in its nature, is religious or, if one prefers, a matter of ultimate values.&#8217; Instead, the basis of the hierarchy is <em>purity</em>. Dumont contrasts India with Polynesia, where commoners can&#8217;t approach the king because his mana is so powerful it might kill them. In India, meanwhile, the Brahmin is the fragile one. These people really can&#8217;t do anything; they&#8217;re so pure that even the shadow of a low-caste person can pollute them, at which point they need to take a ritual bath or rub themselves with one of the five products of the cow. But <em>everyone</em> is polluted by the castes beneath them, which is why people refuse to take water or cooked food or to share a pipe with anyone too far below them in the order of purity. (Obviously you can take raw food, otherwise only the farmers would be able to eat.) This is what keeps the whole thing functioning. So in the chart above, the potter caste will accept boiled rice from the carpenter caste, but not the gardener caste. This is how you can tell that carpenters are higher-caste than gardeners. But absolutely nobody will take food from the tanner caste, who work with dead cows and are therefore inherently impure and untouchable. This holds even though most untouchables didn&#8217;t actually do the impure work associated with their castes; they were usually just agricultural serfs. The stink of leather still clings to their skin.</p><p>Sometimes ordinary power does break through into the system. Rajputs are a powerful warrior caste, so they get sorted right below the Brahmins, even though they eat meat, which is polluting. Nobody wants to argue with a warlord. (Still, if you look at the chart, you&#8217;ll see that a lot of the vegetarian &#8216;C&#8217; castes won&#8217;t take food from a Rajput, despite being notionally beneath them.) But that&#8217;s just power. Every village in India has its local landowning caste, and &#8216;almost any group whatsoever has, in favourable circumstances, been able to become the dominant caste in a given locality.&#8217; The dominant caste can be gardeners or tobacco-curers or shoemakers, as long as there are enough of them, with enough weapons to keep everyone else down. VS Naipaul describes what a dominant caste looks like in an ordinary Bihari village. &#8216;Above the huts rose the rambling two storey brick mansion of the family who had once owned it all, the land and the people: grandeur that wasn&#8217;t grandeur, but was like part of the squalor and defeat out of which it had risen.&#8217; Status in the caste hierarchy is something completely different, and sometimes it&#8217;s actively disempowering. The Brahmins might be at the top of the pole, but because of their impeccable purity they're often the ones who have to cook for other castes at weddings and funerals. Dumont notes that even in the bigger towns, a lot of restaurants and caf&#233;s advertise that they employ a Brahmin cook.</p><p>I feel bad for Louis Dumont. His model was based on a lot of intensive research, and it made a lot of sense, but it was doomed. Here he was, a French anthropologist, positing a coherent and self-contained structure that could be fully understood by the human sciences. The year was 1966. You might have worked out what&#8217;s coming next. Dumont couldn&#8217;t know it, but the entire time he was writing the book an enormous dark thundercloud was building up behind him. Its name was Jacques Derrida, and when it burst it would wash away Dumont&#8217;s entire thesis in a single terrible flood.</p><p>Today, basically every anthropological account of the caste system still finds time to mention Dumont, but only to totally disavow him. Everyone agrees that what he did was <em>bad anthropology</em>, barely any better than the dark old days of the discipline, when it was all about measuring various savages&#8217; skulls to determine their exact IQ, or Indolence Quotient. So in my Blackwell <em>Companion to the Anthropology of India</em>, another big heavy book that&#8217;s been weighing me down in the desert, there&#8217;s a survey of the caste system by Robert Deli&#232;ge, who begins by theatrically accusing Dumont of being &#8216;typical of the Orientalist tradition,&#8217; &#8216;perpetuating the implicit assumption that social order is imposed upon individuals who are passive and static agents,&#8217; and contributing to a racist vision in which India is &#8216;a world devoid of social change, economic development, equality, compassion, and communal solidarity.&#8217; Others have gone further. There&#8217;s a strong current within Hindu nationalism that claims the caste system doesn&#8217;t even exist, because the entire concept of a caste system is intrinsically incoherent. After all, no possible theoretical construct could actually correspond to the free play that escapes the rigours of any particular sign. Pay no attention to the people living in filth and misery on the edge of the city. Don&#8217;t you know that the structure is always simultaneously destructuring itself?</p><p>But despite feeling bad for him, in the end I&#8217;m not sure Dumont&#8217;s project really works. He set out to explain the caste system in its own terms. This is a big job, but it&#8217;s possible. Read Inga Clendinnen&#8217;s <em>Aztecs: an Interpretation</em>, and you won&#8217;t just understand why the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, you&#8217;ll start to wonder how our society manages to function <em>without</em> tearing out hearts for Tezcatlipoca. Dumont does not manage the same feat, because he almost entirely ignores the actual conceptual basis of the entire system. </p><p>Caste, he says, is a hierarchy based on ritual purity. And the concept of ritual purity does actually explain some of the more inexplicable things I&#8217;ve seen in this country. Like the filth. I might not be the first person to have noticed that public space in India is not hygienic. People keep their homes spotless, even if they&#8217;re living in a shack in the slums, and all the shops and restaurants and temples are impeccable too. But as soon as you step outside, it&#8217;s s game of dodge-the-turd, and not all the turds belong to animals. There are signs and murals everywhere begging people to care about their environment, but most people simply refuse. On the train here I was given a plastic tray with little compartments for the chana, dal, rice, chapati, and pickle, a kind of Indian bento box, and afterwards I was wandering around trying to find a bin that would take my dirty tray. Eventually the attendant snatched it from me, looked at me like I was an idiot, and chucked it out the open door of the moving train. It&#8217;s not like India couldn&#8217;t keep itself clean if it wanted to. This country has put a probe on the Moon. But it doesn&#8217;t want to. This is not a cultural value. And when you start thinking from the standpoint of ritual purity, this is actually completely reasonable. The world outside your home is <em>inherently</em> filthy and polluting, because this is where people of different castes mix. A Brahmin has to take a ritual bath whenever they go out. You could pick up all the litter and hose all the shit off the pavement, but it wouldn&#8217;t do anything at all to make those streets clean. So why bother?</p><p>But once Dumont&#8217;s introduced the idea of a purity hierarchy, he then spends the rest of the book thinking exclusively about <em>hierarchy</em>, and never really touches the notion of purity again. But what even <em>is</em> ritual purity? Where&#8217;s it come from? What&#8217;s it for? Dumont briefly plonks down the idea that &#8216;impurity marks the irruption of the biological into social life,&#8217; and suggests that the ritual impurity attached to processes like birth, death, and menstruation ended up attaching itself to lower castes as a permanent condition. But he doesn&#8217;t seem interested in pursuing it. Still, there&#8217;s a weird undercurrent running through his book. Squint at it just right, and it starts to look like the caste system isn&#8217;t really about people at all. It&#8217;s about cattle.</p><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg\" width=\"1456\" height=\"1092\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3133058,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W0I4!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1afdfef4-9e60-4b2c-b546-c03a3fa611ad_3249x2437.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-refresh-cw\"><path d=\"M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8\"></path><path d=\"M21 3v5h-5\"></path><path d=\"M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16\"></path><path d=\"M8 16H3v5\"></path></svg></div><div class=\"pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>There are a lot of cattle in Jaisalmer. Every city in India has its feral cows, but here the streets are <em>full</em> of them. They bellow in the mornings, they leave huge piles of wet shit in the streets, and they make it utterly impossible to get around. Every third alley is blocked off by a huge dumb animal, chewing slowly and displaying absolutely no interest in the world around it. You try to edge around the cow and it just stands there, indifferently occupying the entire width of the street. You try to move it along and it just whips its tail at you like you&#8217;re just another buzzing fly. The cows here are wonderfully gentle creatures: it&#8217;s hard for me to watch them tenderly, lovingly nibble at each other&#8217;s faces without feeling an immense stab of guilt for all those steaks and burgers and rendangs and b&#250;n b&#242; x&#224;os. But they are as thick as bricks, and there are more than five million feral cattle roaming the streets in this country, and this feels like a problem.</p><p>Everyone knows that cows are sacred in Hinduism. But being sacred does not always seem like it&#8217;s <em>good</em> for them. In fact, the way cows are treated here makes me almost want to abandon my Kantianism and become a utilitarian. The governing principle is ahimsa, non-violence, non-interference, which is not the same as ensuring the best possible outcome. So when a cow stops giving milk, instead of slaughtering it the farmer simply lets it wander free. A lot of these cows wander into cities, where people practice ahimsa by letting the sacred cattle eat from piles of stinking garbage on the ground. Cattle with their nuzzles in dumpsters, sweet tottering calves browsing through the filth. Instead of grass, these cows seem to subsist on paper. I&#8217;ve seen them munch down on coffee cups and newspapers and fliers. One cow that had found a trove of discarded books and was systematically eating its way through them all. Eating <em>Shantaram</em>. Eating <em>Atomic Habits</em>. The ribs show through the skin, but the bellies are tight and swollen. Their entire back quarters are splattered with their own liquid, diseased splatterings. It&#8217;s genuinely horrible to see. I try to remember that my own society does terrible things to these animals too, much worse than anything in India, but back home the torture and death takes place behind closed doors where nobody can see. But this is not exactly a comforting thought.</p><p>Here, though, it doesn&#8217;t matter where a cow lives or what it&#8217;s been eating: cows are pure, and cows are purifying. As I&#8217;ve mentioned, after contact with a lower-caste person, Brahmins can cleanse themselves with the five products of the cow. Those five products are milk, ghee, yoghurt, piss, and shit. Cow urine is used in soap and shampoo; it&#8217;s also sold as a medical cure-all. The BJP government has funded research into the cancer-curing properties of cow urine and dung. Floor cleaners made with cow urine have been used in public hospitals. Pathogens in cow piss include leptospira, which can cause jaundice, kidney and liver failure, and bleeding in the lungs, and brucella, which will give you endocarditis, pus-filled testicles, a swollen spleen, and abscesses in your brain. Swabbing down a hospital floor with the stuff is not a very good idea. So why are so many people convinced that it might be? Ask a Hindu, and they&#8217;ll tell you the cow is revered for its generous, motherly gifts of milk. That&#8217;s a very modern answer. It wasn&#8217;t always that way. A few thousand years ago, the people of India&#8212;like a lot of other people around the world&#8212;revered the cow as a <em>sacrificial animal</em>. The best gift for the gods. But it can&#8217;t just be any cow. &#8216;Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke&#8230;&#8217; There are many similar requirements in the Vedas and the Shrauta Sutras. The animal must be clean, washed, perfumed, unblemished, uninjured, undefiled. Whatever goes to the gods must be pure. Or, in other words: purity is whatever gets devoured by the gods.</p><p>Ritual sacrifice isn&#8217;t such a big deal in contemporary Hinduism. But Dumont keeps finding inconvenient traces of it scattered about the caste system. Cows keep wandering into his alleyways. In that chart above, he has to distinguish between &#8216;kacca&#8217; and &#8216;pakka&#8217; foods. Pakka is safer than kacca; you can take it from lower castes. The difference is that kacca is food boiled in water, and pakka is fried in ghee. It&#8217;s shielded from contamination thanks to &#8216;the protective role of butter, a product of the cow.&#8217; The system of mutual independence between castes in a single village&#8212;the barbers cut the tailors&#8217; hair, the tailors cut the barbers&#8217; suits, the blacksmiths make their scissors&#8212;is called the jajmani system. But the word <em>jajman</em> doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with bucolic village communities. It comes from the Sanskrit <em>yajam&#257;na</em>, which refers to the person who commissions an animal sacrifice. In fact, the entire hierarchy of varnas originally centred around animal sacrifice. Vaishyas raise the cattle, Kshatriyas sponsor the festival, but only a Brahmin can actually plunge the knife into the animal&#8217;s neck. Today, of course, killing a cow is unthinkable. But Dumont does stumble on another weird parallel. The two worst crimes imaginable are the murder of a cow and the murder of a Brahmin. Their lives are, in some way, equivalent. </p><p>Just like Marx said, the caste system was called forth by a crude form of the division of labour. But that labour didn&#8217;t produce ordinary use-values: it produced <em>sacrifices</em>, flesh for the gods. It also no longer exists, not in any large-scale way, even if people like Raja still send the odd goat to Bhairava. Animal sacrifice declined, and the caste system emerged to replace it&#8212;with the position of the sacrificed animal, the pure and unpolluted meal for the gods, taken over <em>by the Brahmin himself</em>. Meanwhile, the Brahmin&#8217;s original functions&#8212;slaughtering cattle, butchering cattle, cutting the skin of cattle&#8212;were displaced onto the absolute lowest and most despised members of society. And around the same time, Hindu texts&#8212;which had, in the Vedic period, had very little to say about the subject&#8212;suddenly start talking almost incessantly about reincarnation and the transmigration of souls.</p><p>Whatever you&#8217;ve been told, India is not a fixed, hierarchical society. In fact, it has an extraordinary rate of social mobility. It&#8217;s just that instead of escaping poverty within your lifetime, you move up in the world through the mechanism of death and reincarnation. The caste system is a ladder. You don&#8217;t advance by being <em>good</em>, exactly: every social stratum has its dharma, the role it has to play within the social whole. The dharma of the king is to rule; the dharma of the barber-caste is to cut hair; the dharma of an airport security officer is to steal your shampoo; the dharma of a prostitute is to corrupt the souls of men; the dharma of an untouchable is to live in miserable squalor in the wastelands out of sight. Conform to your role, and in your next life you&#8217;ll be born a little purer, a little more refined, a little higher up the chain. It might take ten billion lifetimes, but once you reach the very top your purity is impeccable. You are clean. You are unblemished. There is nowhere else to go. You have made yourself a meal fit for the gods. </p><p>The whole of society is one huge sacrifice ritual. Maybe it&#8217;s the same for all systems of purity and stratification. Virtue politics, being a decent person, class society and its inequalities: a cleansing before the slaughter. </p><p>About an hour&#8217;s drive into the desert from Jaisalmer are the ruins of Kuldhara. One well-preserved temple and a few half-crumbled mansions in a landscape of broken walls. In the thirteenth century, this village was settled by the Paliwals, a Brahmin clan from the east. They lived there for hundreds of years, until, one night in 1823, the entire population vanished. They left their gold and their jewels and their lentils cooking over the fire. No bodies were ever found. At the very top of the class system there stands Kali, her fangs dripping with blood, the consumer of souls.</p><div><hr></div><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://samkriss.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">This edition of <em>Numb in India</em> is free, but the others aren&#8217;t.

Paid subscribers can join us in a brain-melting tourist odyssey across the past and future of Indias real and imagined. Last year, in China, free subscribers got to peek behind the curtain in a free post on the insanity of the Chinese language. This post on the caste system is also free, but all the best parts of all the others are behind the paywall. If you want to come along, all you have to do is click the button below:\nSubscribe now\n\nToday I’m writing from Jaisalmer, a fortified knuckle of sandstone in the middle of the Thar Desert. This city was founded in 1156 by the Bhati, a Rajput clan pushed into the desert from their Afghan heartland by waves of invaders from the steppe. According to Orlando, for the people of Jaisalmer not much has changed since. Don’t be fooled by their clothes, he told me. Don’t be fooled by the fact that they’ve all got iPhones. Out here, the veneer of modernity gets real thin. This is a closed society. Inside their heads—and here he tapped against the side of his own head—it’s still 1156.\nI met Orlando in a tiny bookshop-café tangled up somewhere in Jaisalmer’s knot of alleys. This is a weird place. A lot of the streets here don’t have names: even on Google a bunch of addresses simply consist of ‘near the Lakshmi temple’ or ‘near the eastern wall.’ The postman knows where it is. But it meant I only got one conversation with Orlando, because when I tried to find that bookshop-café again, it was unreachable. I just kept turning one corner after another onto a succession of charming alleyways lined with ornate overhanging balconies, all baking and silent in the forty-degree afternoon, none of which contained my destination. I was circling the little red pin on my maps app, sometimes coming extremely close, sometimes landing on top of it, but somehow the actual place was nowhere to be seen. It had absconded from Euclidean space. It was accessible only via some special alley, running at an angle slightly against the grain of the rest of the physical universe. But I remember the place. The bookshop sold what every bookshop in every tourist destination in India sells: the Bhagavad Gita, Shantaram, and Atomic Habits. They also did a decent stuffed paratha, and a little notice explained that if you dobbed him a few hundred rupees the owner would drive you out to his village in the desert and introduce you to his mum. There was also a Polaroid of the owner and Orlando posted up near the entrance, although I didn’t really notice it until after I’d met the man himself. Maybe met is the wrong word. What happened is that while I was midway through my paratha, Orlando entered and started talking to me. He continued for maybe two hours, at which point I said that I probably ought to get going. About half an hour later, I actually left. Maybe that was rude of me, leaving. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been allowed to return.\nThere are two types of people who will just talk at you like this, going through their entire life story without ever stopping to ask you a perfunctory question about yourself. Old people do it, and Americans do it too. Orlando was both. Fortunately, his life story was interesting. He came into the café plump, pale, and sweating; smartly dressed, with his linen shirt neatly tucked into his cargo pants, but a big crunchy bucket hat on his head. He never told me exactly where he was from, just that he had quit the United States and had no intention of ever, ever going back. He lived in Hội An now, in a medium-sized apartment that he showed me through the many, many pictures on his phone. Here’s the bedroom. Here’s the bathroom. They both had the exact same white marble tiles on the floor. Isn’t it beautiful? he kept saying. He said that the American Dream was no longer possible in America; you had to go to Vietnam. He showed me a picture of his fridge-freezer. That’s it, he said, wide freezer, there’s a grocery store on the ground floor of my building, I don’t even have to go outside: that’s the American Dream. But he’d only recently discovered that the spirit of liberty is still alive on the Thu Bồn Delta: before that, he’d spent five years living in Jaisalmer. It hadn’t worked out. There had been some catastrophe, some nameless bad thing had happened, and the people of this tiny hairball of a city had forced him to leave. But even if he couldn’t live here, he still kept coming back, for a month at a time, to check in on his old friends. Or to let his enemies know that they still hadn’t won.\nI had to piece together Orlando’s story from the various little crumbs he dropped here and there in his long ramble, but I’ll give it to you in chronological order. Orlando had only recently retired from his job somewhere in the blandness of America when he got some very bad medical news. He responded by buying a plane ticket. Over the months that followed the medical news got worse and worse and his tickets got more and more expensive, until eventually it got so bad that he bought a one way flight. His wife didn’t approve. She still had a life. Whatever it was Orlando was doing, she’d had enough; she wanted him to come home. So that was it: after forty-eight years together, after everything they’d been through in that time, he divorced her.\nOrlando drifted weightless around the world until he finally came to rest in Jaisalmer. He loved it here, this squiggle of old, old streets almost chiselled out of the rock. And he was welcomed, at first. Jaisalmer runs on the tourist industry, now there are no more camel caravans crossing the Thar Desert. According to Booking.com, this is one of the ten most welcoming cities on the planet. But the people of Jaisalmer expect their visitors to come, have various wonderful experiences, buy lots of tat, and then, crucially, leave. Orlando wouldn’t leave. He rented a room from an ancient, impoverished Brahmin woman inside the fort and started trying to worm his way into the actual life of the city. Accompanying his landlady to funerals. Eating meals with her. This made people antsy. Jaisalmer, Orlando kept telling me, is a closed society. Anyone with money can stay in its hotels, but only Brahmins and Rajputs are allowed to actually live inside the fort. Orlando was crossing a line. Eventually people started asking him what it was he did for a living. They weren’t making small talk: they were trying to place him in the caste system. They were trying to work out what sort of creature he was. But Orlando is an American: he comes from the shapeless world. I don’t do anything for a living, he told them, I just exist. Only one of his new neighbours was smart enough to ask: so, what did you do before you did nothing? Orlando fobbed him off too. Eventually, the head of the local Brahmin clan took him in for an interrogation. When you die, the Brahmin asked him, do you want to die in America or in India? Orlando told him that he was never going back to America. He lived in India now, and he wanted to die here too. The Brahmin wasn’t finished. When you die, he said, do you want to be buried or burned? Orlando pretended to think about it. I reckon burned, he decided. And when you’re burned, the Brahmin said, do you want the ashes to go in the ground or in the water? Orlando mulled this one over for a while. You know, he said, I’d never really thought about it, but my gut is telling me the ashes should go in the water. And that was it. The clan accepted him. He could stay.\nBut it’s dangerous, telling an American that the clan accepts him. Every single American goes through life nurturing the secret hope that some clan of brightly-dressed indigenes will some day realise that he has the spirit of the coyote, just like them, and adopt him into the tribe. It’s part of that colonial complex they have. Sooner or later, your American will get weird and start pushing boundaries. Orlando started pushing boundaries in very short order. All of this had happened in late 2019; a few months later, suddenly everyone in the world was confined to their homes and Jaisalmer’s tourist trade dried up overnight. For a town that produces nothing except beauty, this was very bad news. Orlando holed up in his landlady’s empty apartment, just the two of them in the dark, in a city gone silent. Everyone was suffering, pawning their gold jewellery to make it through the year, but unlike all his fellow clan members Orlando had a big fat American 401(k), and far away in New York the stock market was booming. A good chunk of it ended up in his landlady’s pockets. She was very grateful. She thanked him the only way she could: by performing puja to him, tying a rakhi around his wrist, and declaring him to be her brother. This, Orlando told me, was a big deal. Brother-sister relationships are not taken lightly in Hinduism. It might have been less serious if he and the landlady had just had sex.\nOrlando’s version of events is that her clan were upset at being upstaged: that he’d stepped in to help this old woman when none of her actual family would. Shame becomes anger. And that might well have been part of it. But try to see things from their perspective. You make your accommodations with the tourist trade, but if you’re a very traditional Hindu—and a lot of people in Jaisalmer are—then all foreigners are technically outcastes, mleccha, impure, untouchable. Technically, Orlando and I and all the other rich Westerners who descend on this town to take photos and spend money occupy the same caste position as the shit-haulers and carrion-eaters, the people too impure to live in the village, who have to bed down with pigs in the filth-heaps outside. No one’s so strict now, obviously. You make your accommodations. Break bread with the rich outcastes, dress them up in colourful turbans, and always, always smile. You’ll even accept this one funny mleccha as an honorary member of the clan, a kind of animal mascot, like the goat that’s a sergeant in the Indian Army. But if he’s a brother, that means you have actual kinship relations with this creature. Suddenly it’s not a game any more. Word got to Orlando that he was no longer safe in Jaisalmer, and if he knew what was good for him he’d get out. So he did, in a hurry. He wiped his hard drive, carried his clothes and gadgets out of the fort, and gave them to a Muslim family with instructions to donate it all to the poor. Straight to the airport from there. Off to Vietnam, where the Communist Party is in power and the American Dream is alive: a normal, modern society where the world is nice and shapeless and anyone can rent an apartment from anyone else.\nWhen I left, there were sonic booms overhead. Jaisalmer might be a medieval town with a medieval mindset, but it’s also a frontier town now: its isolated spot in the middle of the desert puts it right near the border with Pakistan. On the streets below, Brahmin clans protect the old ways in their half-rotten homes. Up above, the Indian Air Force flings billion-dollar fighter jets against the sky.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nOrlando isn’t the only American I’ve encountered out here. Back in part two I talked about learning the terrible secret of the Sun in Sawai Jai Singh’s city of Jaipur, but I didn’t mention that while I was there, entirely by chance, I ran into my friend Meagan Day, who you might know from her excellent labour reportage for Jacobin. Meagan was in India for the annual conference of the Global Labour University, which was held this year at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. At JNU the walls were painted with the words Workers of the world, unite! in English, Hindi, and Malayalam, and there were talks from union organisers who’d been through truly terrible things in countries where they break strikes with clubs and guns. After the conference was over, she had a couple of days free, so she went to Jaipur to see some forts and palaces and gold and jewels. A few days for the proletariat, a few days for the aristocracy.\nIt was fun: we were ushered through various gaudily decorated rooms of state by a mandatory tour guide who kept pointing out the best spots for selfies; later we were menaced by the monkeys at the monkey temple. But during her time in Delhi, Meagan had managed to pick up on some of what’s happening on the Indian student left. What’s happening is this: a lot of people involved happen to be Brahmins, and every six months someone notices this fact, at which point everyone starts violently melting down over casteism and caste politics, and then as soon as the situation stabilises it happens again. Most recently, some academics released a statement supporting hunger-striking students, in which they repeated a few of the students’ demands: a caste census, new student faculty elections, more sensitivity trainings, etc. The hunger strikers fid not take kindly to that ‘etc.’ Posters on the ‘etc-ification’ of oppressed-caste issues started appearing all over campus. ‘It’s not just about the grammar of the English language; it’s actually about the grammar of Brahminical politics.’\nAccording to Raja, our guide in Jaipur, caste no longer matters in India. He came from the Verma caste, traditionally goldsmiths. And he had been an artist; his works had been exhibited in Germany and the Czech Republic. As it happened, his daughter had just started art school herself, studying textiles. But Raja insisted that this had nothing to do with being Verma. The Verma honour a particular deity called Bhairava, or The Fearsome One, a black, gnashing, sword-wielding, dog-riding emanation of Shiva who once cut off one of the heads of Brahma during an argument. As a Verma, Raja would occasionally sacrifice goats to Bhairava, but his profile picture on WhatsApp showed his actual favourite god: sweet, horny, flute-playing Krishna, all big eyes and pink pouty lips. Raja said he had friends from every caste: he ate with them, he drank with them, and if his daughter wanted to marry a non-Verma of course he wouldn’t care one bit. All of that is gone now, he said. Maybe in the countryside it still matters, but not here. But it clearly matters in Jaisalmer, and it also seemed to matter quite a lot to the Bahujan student activists at JNU. Their convolutions seemed familiar. Meagan and I are both fairly old-fashioned, class-oriented leftists, and for a while in the long 2010s that meant you were drafted into a very silly ideological struggle between class and some nebulous thing called identity. As far as we could tell, something similar is happening in India: caste joins race and gender and sexuality in the big bundle of axes of oppression. But caste is also material: it all has to do with the work you do. It looks like class; it feels like something else. Everyone knows that there’s a caste system in India, but the more you learn about it the murkier things get. What exactly is this thing? Where does it come from? What does it do?\nI think I’ve found an answer. But it’s not what you think. In fact, almost everything you think you know about the caste system is probably wrong. Most Westerners are aware that there are four castes, which are the Brahmins, the priests and scholars, at the top, followed by Kshatriyas, kings and warriors, then Vaishyas, traders and artisans, and finally Shudras, peasants and servants, with the Dalits or untouchables in a kind of conceptual refuse ground beneath the entire system. This fourfold system is called varna, and simple and easy to remember, but it barely exists and hasn’t really functioned for a very long time. The actual Kshatriya lineages are all long extinct, and there are hardly any Vaishyas either; even most relatively high-caste people are from Shudra stock. Varna is also hardly unique to India; essentially the same system organised the estates of the anciens régimes in Europe. The actual castes aren’t the varnas, but the jatis.\nWhat is a jati? Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast included a hereditary clan of ‘Grey Scrubbers’ whose entire lives are spent cleaning the castle kitchens. ‘It had been their privilege on reaching adolescence to discover that, being the sons of their fathers, their careers had been arranged for them. Through daily proximity to the great slabs of stone, the faces of the Grey Scrubbers had become like slabs themselves. The eyes were there, small and flat as coins, and the colour of the walls themselves, as though during the long hours of professional staring the grey stone had at last reflected itself indelibly once and for all.’ That’s a jati. Imagine if every air-traffic controller had to come from one of the secretive families of air-traffic controllers implanted in every city, and instead of passing an exam they simply perform their mysterious rites before a tiny black idol of God in his form as a cosmic air-traffic controller, directing the movements of stars and galaxies from his terminal in the great control tower beyond the physical universe, and then the airports have to hire them. Now imagine the air-traffic controllers all refuse to eat in the presence of pilots, who are their social inferiors, and if the daughter of an air-traffic controller tries to marry a pilot, her parents might try to kill her. Also, one person can ‘be’ a pilot and another an air traffic controller, even though neither of them have been anywhere near an airport and they’re actually both just millet farmers. That’s a jati. There’s no single list of every jati in India, and according to a lot of experts such a list would be impossible, but depending on how you draw your definitions there are anywhere from 3,000 to 25,000 distinct endogamous castes. Water-carriers, barbers, spinners, dung-collectors, cannibals. And every few miles, the entire system shifts, and there’s a new and intricate balance of different castes, each with its own job to perform, its own internal laws, its own customs, and its own gods.\nFor slightly more clued-in Western observers, there have been two main approaches to the caste system. The first has been to see it as an expression of political and economic power relations. This approach is not always Marxist. Early European missionaries in India soon found that if they preached to the lower castes, the Brahmins would refuse to have anything to do with them, so the Jesuits started dividing themselves into castes and maintaining strict separation. Afterwards, they were accused of adopting heathen superstitions. (This happened to the Jesuits a lot, possibly because they kept adopting heathen superstitions. At the same time, over in China, they were happily taking part in Confucian sacrifices.) The missionaries replied that caste was a purely social distinction, not a religious one. For a long time, it was assumed by British administrators that the entire caste system had been invented by the Brahmins to entrench their social power. By Marx’s day, a few observers were starting to question this idea, but he was, unsurprisingly, on the side of caste as an expression of social divisions. In The German Ideology, he scoffs: ‘When the crude form of the division of labour which is to be found among the Indians calls forth the caste-system in their state and religion, the historian believes that the caste-system is the power which has produced this crude social form.’\nI am still some kind of Marxist, so I am eventually going to conclude that caste is an expression of the division of labour. But I’m a bad Marxist, so we’re going to get there the long way, through the other approach, the one that involves ideas and ideologies and the thunder of animal-headed gods, rather than simple political and economic facts. And the division of labour we end up with might not be the one you’re used to.\nProbably the best representative of the other side is Louis Dumont’s 1966 opus Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications. It’s an exhaustive study of caste as an ideology, and I’ve been lugging all five hundred and fifty pages around this vast country. In a moment we can consider whether Homo Hierarchicus is a good or useful book; the most important thing to know about it, though, is that it contains some really beautiful and incomprehensible French-structuralist diagrams, like this:\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nDumont’s aim is to examine the caste system from the inside: instead of starting with big historical theories, he wants to reconstruct what it’s like to see the world through the eyes of someone deeply embedded in the world of caste. This is a difficult job. Europeans instinctively see society as a collection of basically autonomous individuals who have decided to come together for mutual gain. Indians are simply not the same. For Indians, any individual human being is just a piece of a rigid, all-encompassing hierarchy. And hierarchy is what Dumont identifies as the main principle of the caste system. Hierarchy looks a lot like ordinary power, but Dumont insists it’s something entirely different. There’s a division of labour, but ‘it eludes what we call economics because it is founded on an implicit reference to the whole, which, in its nature, is religious or, if one prefers, a matter of ultimate values.’ Instead, the basis of the hierarchy is purity. Dumont contrasts India with Polynesia, where commoners can’t approach the king because his mana is so powerful it might kill them. In India, meanwhile, the Brahmin is the fragile one. These people really can’t do anything; they’re so pure that even the shadow of a low-caste person can pollute them, at which point they need to take a ritual bath or rub themselves with one of the five products of the cow. But everyone is polluted by the castes beneath them, which is why people refuse to take water or cooked food or to share a pipe with anyone too far below them in the order of purity. (Obviously you can take raw food, otherwise only the farmers would be able to eat.) This is what keeps the whole thing functioning. So in the chart above, the potter caste will accept boiled rice from the carpenter caste, but not the gardener caste. This is how you can tell that carpenters are higher-caste than gardeners. But absolutely nobody will take food from the tanner caste, who work with dead cows and are therefore inherently impure and untouchable. This holds even though most untouchables didn’t actually do the impure work associated with their castes; they were usually just agricultural serfs. The stink of leather still clings to their skin.\nSometimes ordinary power does break through into the system. Rajputs are a powerful warrior caste, so they get sorted right below the Brahmins, even though they eat meat, which is polluting. Nobody wants to argue with a warlord. (Still, if you look at the chart, you’ll see that a lot of the vegetarian ‘C’ castes won’t take food from a Rajput, despite being notionally beneath them.) But that’s just power. Every village in India has its local landowning caste, and ‘almost any group whatsoever has, in favourable circumstances, been able to become the dominant caste in a given locality.’ The dominant caste can be gardeners or tobacco-curers or shoemakers, as long as there are enough of them, with enough weapons to keep everyone else down. VS Naipaul describes what a dominant caste looks like in an ordinary Bihari village. ‘Above the huts rose the rambling two storey brick mansion of the family who had once owned it all, the land and the people: grandeur that wasn’t grandeur, but was like part of the squalor and defeat out of which it had risen.’ Status in the caste hierarchy is something completely different, and sometimes it’s actively disempowering. The Brahmins might be at the top of the pole, but because of their impeccable purity they're often the ones who have to cook for other castes at weddings and funerals. Dumont notes that even in the bigger towns, a lot of restaurants and cafés advertise that they employ a Brahmin cook.\nI feel bad for Louis Dumont. His model was based on a lot of intensive research, and it made a lot of sense, but it was doomed. Here he was, a French anthropologist, positing a coherent and self-contained structure that could be fully understood by the human sciences. The year was 1966. You might have worked out what’s coming next. Dumont couldn’t know it, but the entire time he was writing the book an enormous dark thundercloud was building up behind him. Its name was Jacques Derrida, and when it burst it would wash away Dumont’s entire thesis in a single terrible flood.\nToday, basically every anthropological account of the caste system still finds time to mention Dumont, but only to totally disavow him. Everyone agrees that what he did was bad anthropology, barely any better than the dark old days of the discipline, when it was all about measuring various savages’ skulls to determine their exact IQ, or Indolence Quotient. So in my Blackwell Companion to the Anthropology of India, another big heavy book that’s been weighing me down in the desert, there’s a survey of the caste system by Robert Deliège, who begins by theatrically accusing Dumont of being ‘typical of the Orientalist tradition,’ ‘perpetuating the implicit assumption that social order is imposed upon individuals who are passive and static agents,’ and contributing to a racist vision in which India is ‘a world devoid of social change, economic development, equality, compassion, and communal solidarity.’ Others have gone further. There’s a strong current within Hindu nationalism that claims the caste system doesn’t even exist, because the entire concept of a caste system is intrinsically incoherent. After all, no possible theoretical construct could actually correspond to the free play that escapes the rigours of any particular sign. Pay no attention to the people living in filth and misery on the edge of the city. Don’t you know that the structure is always simultaneously destructuring itself?\nBut despite feeling bad for him, in the end I’m not sure Dumont’s project really works. He set out to explain the caste system in its own terms. This is a big job, but it’s possible. Read Inga Clendinnen’s Aztecs: an Interpretation, and you won’t just understand why the Aztecs practiced human sacrifice, you’ll start to wonder how our society manages to function without tearing out hearts for Tezcatlipoca. Dumont does not manage the same feat, because he almost entirely ignores the actual conceptual basis of the entire system.\nCaste, he says, is a hierarchy based on ritual purity. And the concept of ritual purity does actually explain some of the more inexplicable things I’ve seen in this country. Like the filth. I might not be the first person to have noticed that public space in India is not hygienic. People keep their homes spotless, even if they’re living in a shack in the slums, and all the shops and restaurants and temples are impeccable too. But as soon as you step outside, it’s s game of dodge-the-turd, and not all the turds belong to animals. There are signs and murals everywhere begging people to care about their environment, but most people simply refuse. On the train here I was given a plastic tray with little compartments for the chana, dal, rice, chapati, and pickle, a kind of Indian bento box, and afterwards I was wandering around trying to find a bin that would take my dirty tray. Eventually the attendant snatched it from me, looked at me like I was an idiot, and chucked it out the open door of the moving train. It’s not like India couldn’t keep itself clean if it wanted to. This country has put a probe on the Moon. But it doesn’t want to. This is not a cultural value. And when you start thinking from the standpoint of ritual purity, this is actually completely reasonable. The world outside your home is inherently filthy and polluting, because this is where people of different castes mix. A Brahmin has to take a ritual bath whenever they go out. You could pick up all the litter and hose all the shit off the pavement, but it wouldn’t do anything at all to make those streets clean. So why bother?\nBut once Dumont’s introduced the idea of a purity hierarchy, he then spends the rest of the book thinking exclusively about hierarchy, and never really touches the notion of purity again. But what even is ritual purity? Where’s it come from? What’s it for? Dumont briefly plonks down the idea that ‘impurity marks the irruption of the biological into social life,’ and suggests that the ritual impurity attached to processes like birth, death, and menstruation ended up attaching itself to lower castes as a permanent condition. But he doesn’t seem interested in pursuing it. Still, there’s a weird undercurrent running through his book. Squint at it just right, and it starts to look like the caste system isn’t really about people at all. It’s about cattle.\n\nImage: Unable to generate caption\n\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of cattle in Jaisalmer. Every city in India has its feral cows, but here the streets are full of them. They bellow in the mornings, they leave huge piles of wet shit in the streets, and they make it utterly impossible to get around. Every third alley is blocked off by a huge dumb animal, chewing slowly and displaying absolutely no interest in the world around it. You try to edge around the cow and it just stands there, indifferently occupying the entire width of the street. You try to move it along and it just whips its tail at you like you’re just another buzzing fly. The cows here are wonderfully gentle creatures: it’s hard for me to watch them tenderly, lovingly nibble at each other’s faces without feeling an immense stab of guilt for all those steaks and burgers and rendangs and bún bò xàos. But they are as thick as bricks, and there are more than five million feral cattle roaming the streets in this country, and this feels like a problem.\nEveryone knows that cows are sacred in Hinduism. But being sacred does not always seem like it’s good for them. In fact, the way cows are treated here makes me almost want to abandon my Kantianism and become a utilitarian. The governing principle is ahimsa, non-violence, non-interference, which is not the same as ensuring the best possible outcome. So when a cow stops giving milk, instead of slaughtering it the farmer simply lets it wander free. A lot of these cows wander into cities, where people practice ahimsa by letting the sacred cattle eat from piles of stinking garbage on the ground. Cattle with their nuzzles in dumpsters, sweet tottering calves browsing through the filth. Instead of grass, these cows seem to subsist on paper. I’ve seen them munch down on coffee cups and newspapers and fliers. One cow that had found a trove of discarded books and was systematically eating its way through them all. Eating Shantaram. Eating Atomic Habits. The ribs show through the skin, but the bellies are tight and swollen. Their entire back quarters are splattered with their own liquid, diseased splatterings. It’s genuinely horrible to see. I try to remember that my own society does terrible things to these animals too, much worse than anything in India, but back home the torture and death takes place behind closed doors where nobody can see. But this is not exactly a comforting thought.\nHere, though, it doesn’t matter where a cow lives or what it’s been eating: cows are pure, and cows are purifying. As I’ve mentioned, after contact with a lower-caste person, Brahmins can cleanse themselves with the five products of the cow. Those five products are milk, ghee, yoghurt, piss, and shit. Cow urine is used in soap and shampoo; it’s also sold as a medical cure-all. The BJP government has funded research into the cancer-curing properties of cow urine and dung. Floor cleaners made with cow urine have been used in public hospitals. Pathogens in cow piss include leptospira, which can cause jaundice, kidney and liver failure, and bleeding in the lungs, and brucella, which will give you endocarditis, pus-filled testicles, a swollen spleen, and abscesses in your brain. Swabbing down a hospital floor with the stuff is not a very good idea. So why are so many people convinced that it might be? Ask a Hindu, and they’ll tell you the cow is revered for its generous, motherly gifts of milk. That’s a very modern answer. It wasn’t always that way. A few thousand years ago, the people of India—like a lot of other people around the world—revered the cow as a sacrificial animal. The best gift for the gods. But it can’t just be any cow. ‘Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke…’ There are many similar requirements in the Vedas and the Shrauta Sutras. The animal must be clean, washed, perfumed, unblemished, uninjured, undefiled. Whatever goes to the gods must be pure. Or, in other words: purity is whatever gets devoured by the gods.\nRitual sacrifice isn’t such a big deal in contemporary Hinduism. But Dumont keeps finding inconvenient traces of it scattered about the caste system. Cows keep wandering into his alleyways. In that chart above, he has to distinguish between ‘kacca’ and ‘pakka’ foods. Pakka is safer than kacca; you can take it from lower castes. The difference is that kacca is food boiled in water, and pakka is fried in ghee. It’s shielded from contamination thanks to ‘the protective role of butter, a product of the cow.’ The system of mutual independence between castes in a single village—the barbers cut the tailors’ hair, the tailors cut the barbers’ suits, the blacksmiths make their scissors—is called the jajmani system. But the word jajman doesn’t have anything to do with bucolic village communities. It comes from the Sanskrit yajamāna, which refers to the person who commissions an animal sacrifice. In fact, the entire hierarchy of varnas originally centred around animal sacrifice. Vaishyas raise the cattle, Kshatriyas sponsor the festival, but only a Brahmin can actually plunge the knife into the animal’s neck. Today, of course, killing a cow is unthinkable. But Dumont does stumble on another weird parallel. The two worst crimes imaginable are the murder of a cow and the murder of a Brahmin. Their lives are, in some way, equivalent.\nJust like Marx said, the caste system was called forth by a crude form of the division of labour. But that labour didn’t produce ordinary use-values: it produced sacrifices, flesh for the gods. It also no longer exists, not in any large-scale way, even if people like Raja still send the odd goat to Bhairava. Animal sacrifice declined, and the caste system emerged to replace it—with the position of the sacrificed animal, the pure and unpolluted meal for the gods, taken over by the Brahmin himself. Meanwhile, the Brahmin’s original functions—slaughtering cattle, butchering cattle, cutting the skin of cattle—were displaced onto the absolute lowest and most despised members of society. And around the same time, Hindu texts—which had, in the Vedic period, had very little to say about the subject—suddenly start talking almost incessantly about reincarnation and the transmigration of souls.\nWhatever you’ve been told, India is not a fixed, hierarchical society. In fact, it has an extraordinary rate of social mobility. It’s just that instead of escaping poverty within your lifetime, you move up in the world through the mechanism of death and reincarnation. The caste system is a ladder. You don’t advance by being good, exactly: every social stratum has its dharma, the role it has to play within the social whole. The dharma of the king is to rule; the dharma of the barber-caste is to cut hair; the dharma of an airport security officer is to steal your shampoo; the dharma of a prostitute is to corrupt the souls of men; the dharma of an untouchable is to live in miserable squalor in the wastelands out of sight. Conform to your role, and in your next life you’ll be born a little purer, a little more refined, a little higher up the chain. It might take ten billion lifetimes, but once you reach the very top your purity is impeccable. You are clean. You are unblemished. There is nowhere else to go. You have made yourself a meal fit for the gods.\nThe whole of society is one huge sacrifice ritual. Maybe it’s the same for all systems of purity and stratification. Virtue politics, being a decent person, class society and its inequalities: a cleansing before the slaughter.\nAbout an hour’s drive into the desert from Jaisalmer are the ruins of Kuldhara. One well-preserved temple and a few half-crumbled mansions in a landscape of broken walls. In the thirteenth century, this village was settled by the Paliwals, a Brahmin clan from the east. They lived there for hundreds of years, until, one night in 1823, the entire population vanished. They left their gold and their jewels and their lentils cooking over the fire. No bodies were ever found. At the very top of the class system there stands Kali, her fangs dripping with blood, the consumer of souls.\n\n\n\n\nThis edition of Numb in India is free, but the others aren’t.
